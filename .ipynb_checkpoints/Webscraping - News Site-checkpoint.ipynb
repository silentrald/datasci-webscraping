       "  'title': 'Rory McIlroy: Chasing Bryson DeChambeau’s power has cost me',\n",
       "  'full_article': \"While Rory McIlroy’s struggles go on, Lee Westwood’s outstanding form continued. Just days after taking Bryson DeChambeau to the final hole at the Arnold Palmer Invitational, the Englishman added a 66 to his first-round 69 and leads by one shot from Matthew Fitzpatrick at the Players Championship. McIlroy has admitted a desire to add more length to his game, fuelled in part by DeChambeau’s power play at the 2020 US Open, has triggered technical problems that were visible here. A second round of 75 at Sawgrass, added to Thursday’s 79, meant McIlroy comfortably missed the cut. Afterwards, he expanded on the basis for his swing issues.    Related: Rory McIlroy says Tiger Woods is 'doing better' after car crash   “Probably, like October last year, doing a little bit of speed training, started getting sucked into that stuff, swing got flat, long and too rotational,” said McIlroy. “Obviously I added some speed and am hitting the ball longer but what that did to my swing as a whole probably wasn’t a good thing. So I’m sort of fighting to get back out of that. That’s what I’m frustrated with.” When asked why he had embarked on such a journey, McIlroy’s answer raised eyebrows. “I’d be lying if I said it wasn’t anything to do with what Bryson did at the US Open,” said the four-times major winner. “I think a lot of people saw that and were like, ‘Whoa, if this is the way they’re going to set golf courses up in the future, it helps. It really helps.’ “The one thing that people don’t appreciate is how good Bryson is out of the rough. Not only because of how upright he is but because his short irons are longer than standard, so he can get a little more speed through the rough than us, than other guys. I thought being able to get some more speed is a good thing and maybe just to the detriment a little bit of my swing, I got there. I just need to maybe rein it back in a little bit.”   Related: The day the turf stood still: looking back at sport's sudden shutdown    As McIlroy headed home, Westwood, at nine under par, has aspirations of claiming the Players just a month before his 48th birthday. “I care less about the outcomes now,” said Westwood. “I still care about my performance and that in turn leads me to work as hard as I’ve always worked. But I’ve been working with a psychologist for a few years now and we just focus on the process, we don’t focus on the outcomes and things we can’t control.” Fitzpatrick, who has made back-to-back 68s.

       "  'title': 'Australia commits $100m to Covid vaccine deal at Quad meeting',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'A historic first meeting of leaders of the Quad – an informal grouping of Australia, the United States, India and Japan – has ended with a promise to boost manufacturing of the Covid-19 vaccine to help low-income countries and to keep international climate goals within reach. The leaders during the meeting agreed to pool financing, manufacturing and distribution capacity to send 1 billion coronavirus vaccines to Asian and Pacific island countries by the end of 2022. In a joint statement released after the first meeting, the four leaders called for a “transparent and results-oriented reform” of the World Health Organization and said they would work to strengthen climate actions of all nations.   Related: Australia pressed to show leadership on Indo-Pacific health ahead of Quad meeting   The WHO has made strong calls to rich countries for “vaccine equity” to make sure poorer countries have the same level of access to vaccines as rich countries. The United States president, Joe Biden, Australia’s prime minister, Scott Morrison, Japan’s prime minister, Yoshihide Suga, and India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, met virtually in the early hours of Saturday, Canberra time – the first time the four-member regional grouping had ever convened with heads of government. The Quad countries say they will co-ordinate with COVAX – the international buying facility for vaccines – and raise manufacturing capabilities in India through that country’s Bio E vaccine manufacturing company. The US Development Finance Corporation will fund increased capacity at Bio E to produce at least 1 billion doses of vaccines by the end of 2022. In his opening remarks, Morrison said: “As we emerge from this global pandemic, and the global recession, let us together create a different future. It is the Indo-Pacific that will now shape the destiny of our world in the 21st century.” He said a new Quad vaccine partnership would make sure expanded manufacturing of vaccines would be for “global benefit” and countries in the Indo-Pacific region would get help from “vaccine readiness” to addressing vaccine misinformation and immunisation capacity. Australia will commit $100m to buy vaccines for south-east Asian countries. A Quad vaccine experts group will also be launched to design a plan to implement the Quad’s vaccine work. On climate change, a new Quad climate working group will work to “keep a Paris-aligned temperature limit within reach”. Australia has faced criticism for refusing to commit to a mid-century target of reaching net-zero emissions. A fact sheet released after the Quad meeting did not mention a net-zero target, or say whether the “Paris-aligned target” referred to 1.5C of global heating or the UN commitment to keep temperatures “well below 2C” by the end of the century. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has previously indicated global carbon dioxide emissions would need to decline by about 45% from 2010 levels by 2030 and reach net zero around 2050 in order to ensure no or limited overshoot of 1.5C. The fact sheet did refer to committing to advancing “low emissions technology solutions”, which is the Australian government’s preferred approach. China views the Quad warily because it sees it as a “mini-Nato” and an effort to contain its growing influence.  An historic meeting for India, the United States, Japan and Australia - the first ever leaders’ meeting of the Quad. For us, this meeting is about how we keep Australia and the Indo-Pacific region we live in safe, stable and secure. 🇮🇳 🇺🇸 🇯🇵 🇦🇺 pic.twitter.com/Uk40KccJTJ— Scott Morrison (@ScottMorrisonMP) March 12, 2021  Morrison was joined in the virtual meeting by the Australian foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, and the secretaries of the prime minister’s department and the foreign affairs department, while other leaders were also accompanied by senior ministers and officials. Suga said the group had agreed to meet in person within a year.  今回の会議は、日米豪印の4カ国を、新たなステージに引き上げることができた会合だったと思います。年内に対面での首脳会談を行うことでも一致しました。これから4カ国を中心に、野心的な、そして具体的な成果を出せるよう協力してまいります。 pic.twitter.com/by8IQsj5ws— 菅 義偉 (@sugawitter) March 12, 2021  Some analysts have described the first Quad leaders’ meeting as “a historic step” that signals “a new level of political determination to balance together against Chinese power” among the US, Australia, India and Japan. Prof Rory Medcalf, head of the national security college at the Australian National University, said the meeting showed the importance Biden’s administration was putting on the region. He said Biden had “reshaped” the Quad to be a more constructive and positive force that was open to co-operation, which was a significant shift from a Trump-era approach that was more confrontational. He said the Biden administration was instead opening the door for China to engage and co-operate with the Quad countries, while still allowing competition. “America wants to compete with China and win the hearts and minds of the rest of Asia, rather than take a zero-sum approach.” Medcalf said the Quad would also give the US an opportunity to further push Australia to increase its climate ambition. Biden sent a signal on the priority he placed on climate by inviting his special envoy, John Kerry, to be part of his delegation, which also included the vice-president, Kamala Harris, and the secretary of state, Antony Blinken. Last month Kerry publicly acknowledged past “differences” between the US and Australia in tackling the climate crisis while calling for a faster exit from coal-fired power around the globe. Among the Quad grouping, the US and Japan have already committed to net-zero emissions by 2050, while Australia has expressed a preference to achieve the goal without making a firm pledge amid pushback from the Nationals. India also has not committed to net zero by 2050 but has promised to exceed expectations. On Monday the US and the UK issued a joint statement urging all countries “to take the steps needed to keep a 1.5C temperature limit within reach, including through ambitious nationally determined contributions and long-term strategies to cut emissions and reach net zero”.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': \"Minneapolis to pay George Floyd's family $27m in police custody death lawsuit\",\n",
       "  'full_article': 'The city of Minneapolis has agreed to pay $27m to settle a civil lawsuit with the family of George Floyd, even as jury selection was under way in the murder trial of the former police of the former police officer, Derek Chauvin, who killed him. The city council unanimously approved the settlement on Friday. The council emerged from closed session to announce the move, which includes $500,000 for the neighborhood where Floyd was arrested.   Related: Derek Chauvin trial: judge grants request to add third-degree murder charge   The Floyd family attorney, Ben Crump, said in a prepared statement that it was the largest pre-trial civil rights settlement ever in a wrongful death lawsuit, and “sends a powerful message that Black lives do matter and police brutality against people of color must end”. Floyd, who was Black, was declared dead on 25 May 2020 after Derek Chauvin, a former police officer who is white, pressed his knee against his neck for almost nine minutes. Floyd’s death sparked mass protests in Minneapolis and across the US and led to a national reckoning on racial justice. “I hope that today will center the voices of the family and anything that they would like to share,” the council president, Lisa Bender, said. “But I do want to, on behalf of the entire city council, offer my deepest condolences to the family of George Floyd, his friends and all of our community who are mourning his loss.” Floyd’s sister, Bridgett Floyd, said in a statement: “On behalf of all of my family members, I am pleased that this part of our tragic journey to justice for my brother George is resolved.” She added: “Our family suffered an irreplaceable loss May 25 when George’s life was senselessly taken by a Minneapolis police officer. While we will never get our beloved George back, we will continue to work tirelessly to make this world a better, and safer, place for all.” Floyd’s family filed the federal civil rights lawsuit in July against the city, Chauvin and three other fired officers charged in his death. It alleged the officers violated Floyd’s rights when they restrained him, and that the city allowed a culture of excessive force, racism and impunity to flourish in its police force.   Related: Minneapolis on trial: how the year of George Floyd changed me and my city   George Floyd’s brother, Philonise Floyd, said of the settlement: “Even though my brother is not here, he’s here with me in my heart. If I could get him back, I would give all this back.” “That dollar amount shows that what happened to George Floyd was wrong. It goes to show that we matter but it’s an opportunity to show that these types of injustices are wrong. It was a clear violation of George Floyd’s civil rights. It shouldn’t have happened,” said Todd Gramenz of Black Lives Matter St Paul. Black Lives Matter Saint Paul was established in 2014 after Michael Brown was killed in Ferguson. They have been organizing protests and lobbying since then. Gramenz added that you cannot really put a dollar value on a life. “How do you value a Black man, who’s innocent, that’s killed?” he said, and called for more police who kill to stand trial. Only one Minnesota police officer has been convicted a murder before, a Black officer who killed a white women, yet several hundred Minnesotans have suffered police-involved deaths in the last 20 years. It was not immediately clear how the settlement might affect the trial or the jury now being seated to hear it. Joseph Daly, a professor emeritus at Mitchell Hamline School of Law, said it will be hard to stop jurors or potential jurors from hearing about it. “Judge Cahill will likely explain to the jurors that each must make a decision based solely on the evidence they hear in the criminal trial,” Daly said. Any praise for the settlement overlooks “how many families that have failed to get a settlement and how they have failed to hold police accountable”, DJ Hooker from the Twin Cities Coalition for Justice 4 Jamar campaign group told the Guardian. He added: “It’s good that we see that this happened with the $27m but on top of that, we need to make sure that happens for all families affected by police brutality. Everyone doesn’t get the same amount. It’s not fair. Everyone needs to be able to get money when their loved ones die.” However, Hooker said holding police officers accountable and protecting the community by preventing brutality and violence was vital. L Chris Stewart, an attorney who worked with Floyd’s family, said the size of the settlement “changes evaluations and civil rights for a Black person when they die”. “And what happens is that trickles down to decisions in the communities across this country. When there is a city council or a mayor deciding, ‘Oh, should we get rid of no-knock warrants, should we get rid of chokeholds, do we want to change these policies?’ They have 27m reasons now why they should,” he said. Meanwhile, with jury selection in its fourth day, seven people have been seated so far, with the jury roughly balanced between white people and people of color, according to the authorities. Opening statements are expected around 29 March. \\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'New York senators urge Cuomo to resign after governor refuses to quit ',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'New York’s two US senators, Chuck Schumer, who is also the Senate majority leader, and Kirsten Gillibrand, joined national and state representatives late Friday afternoon in calling for Andrew Cuomo’s resignation. The New York governor had earlier again refused to resign after a group of New York’s most powerful and prominent Democrats in the House of Representatives joined calls for him to step down over multiple sexual misconduct allegations, and scrutiny over his administration’s misreporting of Covid-19 deaths among nursing home residents. Schumer and Gillibrand put out a joint statement, saying: “Confronting and overcoming the Covid crisis requires sure and steady leadership. We commend the brave actions of the individuals who have come forward with serious allegations of abuse and misconduct.” It continued: “Due to the multiple, credible sexual harassment and misconduct allegations, it is clear that Governor Cuomo has lost the confidence of his governing partners and the people of New York. Governor Cuomo should resign.” At a press conference earlier on Friday, Cuomo denied all of the sexual misconduct allegations and castigated politicians calling for him to quit as “reckless and dangerous” and engaging in “cancel culture”. “I did not do what has been alleged. Period,” Cuomo said. The governor said he wanted investigations into the allegations to proceed but added: “I’m not going to resign. Period. “Politicians who don’t know a single fact but yet form a conclusion and an opinion are, in my opinion, reckless and dangerous,” he added. His statement came shortly after a group of congressional representatives including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a standard bearer for the party’s progressive wing, as well as Jerry Nadler, who chairs the House judiciary committee, and Carolyn Maloney, the chair of the House oversight committee. Nadler said on Friday that Cuomo had lost the confidence of New Yorkers. “The repeated accusations against the governor, and the manner in which he has responded to them, have made it impossible for him to continue to govern at this point,” the congressman said. In a joint statement issued with Jamaal Bowman, another New York congressman, Ocasio-Cortez said the latest allegation of sexual harassment against Cuomo was “alarming” and “raises concerns about the present safety and well-being of the administration’s staff. These allegations have all been consistent and highly detailed, and there are also credible media reports substantiating their accounts”. The duo added that the six accusations of sexual harassment and misconduct leveled at Cuomo came on top of claims that the governor’s administration hid data on Covid-19 deaths in nursing homes, a combination that means that Cuomo “can no longer effectively lead in the face of so many challenges”.   Related: Cuomo aides altered nursing home deaths report, health department confirms   In total, 10 of the 19 Democrats from New York elected to the House of Representatives have now called for Cuomo’s resignation, with Kathleen Rice, who represents a section of New York’s Long Island, previously calling for his removal. On Thursday, Bill de Blasio, mayor of New York City and a longtime Cuomo rival, also urged the governor to step down, alongside 59 New York state lawmakers, meaning that almost all major New York Democratshave now turned on the state’s chief executive. The New York state assembly also launched an “impeachment investigation” into the sexual misconduct allegations made by the six women. A separate investigation is being led by the state attorney general, Letitia James. “The reports of accusations concerning the governor are serious,” said Carl Heastie, the speaker of the state assembly. The assembly judiciary committee will oversee the investigation, which will have the power to interview witnesses and subpoena documents. Forty-seven state senators have already said Cuomo should step down, more than the 46 needed to convict the governor if he was impeached. Separately, police in Albany said that they have been notified of the allegations and that these “may have risen to the level of a crime” although this does not mean they have opened a criminal investigation. Cuomo had previously denied any wrongdoing in his treatment of women, although he has provided a general apology if any of his previous actions made anyone feel uncomfortable. On Friday, Cuomo, who was attorney general of New York and Bill Clinton’s housing secretary and is the son of the late governor Mario Cuomo, said: “I am not part of the political club.” He said it wasn’t clear why all the sexual misconduct allegations had been made now. He said they should be taken very seriously, but he denied any inappropriate conduct. “Look, it’s very simple: I never harassed someone. I’ve never abused anyone,” Cuomo said. “You need to know the facts before you make a decision,” he said, referring to his critics. “People know the difference between playing politics, bowing to cancel culture and the truth.” On the nursing home deaths, the governor has previously claimed his administration had to verify deaths of residents at hospitals, but critics questioned why that hadn’t held up the release of data in other states. Cuomo’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Along with an allegation that the governor groped a female aide at the Executive Mansion last year, Cuomo is facing allegations of sexually suggestive remarks and behavior toward women, including female aides. One aide said he asked her if she would ever have sex with an older man. And another aide claimed Cuomo once kissed her without consent, and said the governor’s aides publicly smeared her after she accused him of sexual harassment. The White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, has repeatedly said that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris both support the attorney general’s investigation into the harassment allegations.

       "  'full_article': \"Two local Labour parties have been suspended after an allegation of electoral fraud was made to police. The East Ham and West Ham Labour branches based in Newham, east London, are now facing an investigation by the party. The Metropolitan police confirmed it made an assessment of a claim of “electoral malpractice” but decided officers did not need to take further action. The move by Labour means no party meetings or business can take place and, while the party refused to divulge the nature of the investigation, it is understood to be “serious”.   Related: Labour suggests ministers failed to do analysis of Brexit deal   In an internal email from London Labour officials to members, reported by LabourList, the allegations are said to be “wide-ranging and supported by a considerable amount of evidence”. It continues: “Furthermore, we also understand that allegations of electoral fraud are being separately investigated by the Metropolitan police.” The email said “significant” irregularities had been found in “new member sign-ups over a sustained period” so a “full audit of the membership” would be launched. A spokesperson for the party said: “Labour takes all complaints extremely seriously, and they are fully investigated in line with our rules and procedures and any appropriate action is taken.” And the Metropolitan police said: “In August 2020 the MPS received a report alleging electoral malpractice in the borough of Newham. An assessment was completed which concluded that no police investigation was required.” Newham is an area with very high support for Labour: all 60 of its councillors – barring one where the position is vacant – represent the Labour party. The borough also has a Labour mayor.   Related: Shaun Bailey accused of 'prehistoric' views on lack of female MPs   The byelection to fill the remaining seat “is to be postponed”, according to the email sent to members on Friday. “Alternative arrangements are being made to ensure that a candidate is in place in time to contest the byelection,” it added. Newham has previously been embroiled in an electoral row in 2017, when local members claimed there were “many failures of process/propriety and procedural irregularities” during a trigger ballot to decide whether the then-directly elected mayor should automatically remain the party’s candidate at the next election.\\n\",\n",

       "  'full_article': \"Pep Guardiola has criticised the pitch at the Etihad Stadium, claiming it has been bad since he took charge of the club in the summer of 2016. Having cited Anfield and Old Trafford as stadiums with good pitches to play on, Guardiola compared the one at the Etihad with that of Craven Cottage, where his team play on Saturday. The Etihad had maintenance done in April during the first lockdown but plans to have a first big overhaul in 11 years last summer were prevented by the pandemic. While there are hopes this plan can be revived in the close season, ground staff have recently been able to reseed the pitch due to City’s run of away games.   Related: José Mourinho brushes off Arsenal by insisting he only 'looks up' league table   “They [ground staff] are working a lot, we are trying to find a solution but the grass is not good,” said Guardiola. “Since day one when I arrived here we can do better. The weather is tough but I am not the green-keeper. They [ground staff] give me and the club the reasons and we say: ‘OK, this is what it is.’ “We accept it because I cannot argue with them because I am not a green-keeper – I don’t talk about anything that I’m not an expert in. But the reality is the grass is not good. Everyone knows it. We try every season to find a solution knowing that the weather will change, the sun will not come, and we have to find a way that as much as possible, from October until March, the grass can be better, as good as possible because we need it to avoid injuries, for better football, for many reasons. I am pretty sure the club will do the best to try to find a solution as it always does.” He added: “I know the weather condition here in England is tough, but there are stadiums where the grass is good. We were in London against Arsenal, we were in Anfield, even in Old Trafford and the grass was better than ours. We were in Budapest [Puskas Arena] for a Champions League game, and the grass was incredible, like a carpet, so it was amazing and our grass still isn’t good and we need it.”   The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.  Fulham host the league leaders having taken 12 points from their past seven games, the most recent of which came in victory at Anfield last Sunday. Scott Parker’s side remain in the relegation zone, but only on goal difference. “I am impressed with Fulham here, the pace they have, their organisation: their stadium is difficult, the grass is not in good condition like ours, so they are a real tough opponent,” said Guardiola.\\n\",\n",

       "  'title': 'Relentless Harry Kane proving to be both reward and risk for Tottenham',\n",
       "  'full_article': \"It was broadly hushed up last Sunday but Harry Kane was not in the original Tottenham line-up for the Premier League fixture against Crystal Palace. He then underwent a late fitness test on an unspecified problem, felt he could pull through and told José Mourinho so. Equipped with this information Mourinho did what he almost always does, what Mauricio Pochettino did before him at Spurs and what Gareth Southgate also does whenever possible with England – he started Kane. The centre-forward would register two goals and two assists in the 4-1 win.   Related: José Mourinho brushes off Arsenal by insisting he only 'looks up' league table   Spool forward to Thursday night and another important game – the Europa League last 16, first leg against Dinamo Zagreb. Kane started, scored twice and was substituted on 84 minutes of what would finish as a 2-0 victory. When Kane sat down in the dugout, a club medic promptly affixed possibly the biggest ice pack ever seen to his right knee. Cue panic among the Spurs support, albeit only briefly. Kane would remove the ice before full time and Mourinho later said that he would be OK for Sunday’s derby at Arsenal. It was only at the end of January that Kane injured both of his ankles against Liverpool, one worse than the other, to be forced off at half-time. There were fears of a three-week absence but he was back after 10 days to score the opening goal in the 2-0 defeat of West Bromwich Albion. Spurs lost the two games that he missed against Brighton and Chelsea – each by a 1-0 scoreline. It is stating the obvious to say Kane is fundamental to Spurs’s hopes. When he has been a substitute in the domestic cups this season, the ties have been in the balance each time and Mourinho has always sent him on. The manager also started him in two of the three Europa League qualifiers, which were knockout games, and introduced him as a substitute in the other, at Shkendija, when it was 1-1. The sense in recent weeks is that Kane is beginning to feel the strain on his body and Mourinho’s management of his minutes has become a topic for forensic analysis. How does he do it from here on? During the Europa League group phase, he was able to use Kane mainly as a substitute or not at all while he got through both legs of the last 32 against the Austrian minnows, Wolfsberger, without him.    Harry Kane clutches his knee during Spurs’s 2-0 victory over Dinamo Zagreb on Thursday. The striker was later seen with an ice-pack over the joint, raising fears he will miss Sunday’s north London derby. Photograph: Andrew Fosker/BPI/Shutterstock   But as the season enters its defining weeks, there do not seem to be many more games in which Mourinho would be comfortable to omit Kane. Perhaps next Thursday’s second leg against Dinamo could be one. There are three at the end of the month that Mourinho would choose, although they are England’s World Cup qualifiers against San Marino, Albania and Poland. It is doubtful Southgate would see it the same way and so expect a bit more back-and-forth between the pair. What is clear is that Kane has had and will continue to have a decisive say over how he feels and his readiness to play. The problem would come if his determination to be involved and the responsibility he embraces were to obscure common sense, and the impression has long been that Kane will always put his hand up for every minute; he will run and run until he drops. Mourinho insists that the approach is collaborative but the risks and edginess are pronounced.   Related: Harry Kane doubles up to sink Dinamo Zagreb and put Spurs in driving seat   “Harry had a little knock the day before [the Palace game] … we had everybody fit in the team, we don’t want to risk players,” Mourinho said, when asked about Kane’s original absence last Sunday. “We wanted to give a 100% guarantee that by playing he wouldn’t affect the near future. We did just a little, if you want to call it a test or a little thing, just to make sure that he was right for the game and he was. “Was it Harry saying: ‘Play me?’ Yes. Of course. Like everyone. With me, players make these decisions. When a player is a doubt … I trust the player more than anything and the relationship that we have between coaching staff, medical staff and players is a very professional relationship. But the players’ feelings are very important.” A related point – poor Carlos Vinícius. It is unclear whether the striker needed to be stood down for Palace but he is sure to have been disappointed to have featured only for six minutes against Dinamo as Kane’s replacement, having generally started in the Europa League when available. If Vinícius did not appreciate the tough reality of being Kane’s back-up when he signed on loan from Benfica last October, he does now. Mourinho denied that Kane’s desire to play every minute was a problem, but he then veered off on a significant tangent. “The most difficult part of it … and that’s the reason why I love Vinícius … is to have a very good striker that doesn’t play many minutes and keeps motivated and working hard and fit and ready to help the team. So my special words go to Vinícius because he is a very good player and an amazing guy in the group. “When you have a striker like Harry, that doesn’t affect only in terms of goals scored but also the quality and dynamic of the team. We know that he has important routines [link-ups] built with other players and it’s difficult to leave him out.” And so to the derby, a fixture in which Kane is the record scorer; he has 11 goals in 14 appearances. Vinícius will be ready. All eyes will be on Kane.\\n\",\n",

       "  'title': 'Thomas Tuchel has no qualms over calling out Chelsea players in matches',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Thomas Tuchel is not worried about upsetting Chelsea’s players by admonishing them during games and said he has mellowed on the touchline in recent years, admitting “nobody was safe” from him at the start of his managerial career. Tuchel showed his ruthless side when he substituted Callum Hudson-Odoi on and off during Chelsea’s draw with Southampton last month and he was heard criticising Timo Werner’s positioning during his side’s win over Everton on Monday. The former Paris Saint-Germain manager told the forward in German: “Timo, how long are you staying on the left? You’re playing on the right! The last 15 minutes you’ve only been on the left! Don’t you understand?”   Related: Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend   However Tuchel does not believe his demanding style is a risk, adding that he does not mind his players being direct with him in return. “It was very direct and in the moment where there are no spectators, it can happen that things like this are out there,” Chelsea’s manager said. “We reminded Timo to join back to his position on the right side because he was a bit too long on the left side. “There was no insult, it was not aggressive. If it’s respectful, if we’re not insulting each other, no problems being direct to me – also the players. Sometimes the coach is in the game mode and things are direct. Sometimes things are not pronounced in the most friendly way. I agree, but I’m also in game mode, the players are in game mode. I have the feeling that nobody takes things too personal.” Tuchel rarely hides his feelings during games. “You should have seen me 10 years ago, it was double and triple,” he said. “I was totally sucked into the match. I was sweating all over, I was attacking the fourth official all the time. I was attacking the referees, everybody on the bench. Nobody was safe. I calmed down a lot, which is also necessary because it is not always the best way to express all your feelings. “I want to push the players to their maximum. Sometimes you will see me acting hysterically, sometimes you will see me sitting and reflecting and discussing with my assistants. I am an emotional guy. When the game is on I feel like a part of it. At the same time I am still developing and it is not about me, it’s about what helps the players and this is what I demand: that I do the best for my players.” Tuchel has lightened the mood since replacing Frank Lampard at Chelsea, who visit Leeds on Saturday, with the 47-year-old not following the harsh fines system implemented by Lampard. Instead, he joked about losing a friendly match at training this week. “I am feeling a little bit that I have lost my authority because yesterday I lost in the staff match 4-3,” he said. “They did not let me win. The first match between the staff I won with my team. It is a lack of respect. Maybe we have to change things, not laugh too much.   The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.  “I was not aware of the fines. Pretty sure my captains take care of that. I have no complaints. Everybody has been on time. Nobody was ever late. This is what concerns me. If a player arrives at 10.01 or 9.59 I am not the police.” Chelsea, who are fourth, are set to be without Thiago Silva and Tammy Abraham against Leeds. Abraham is still troubled by an ankle injury, making him doubtful for England’s fixtures this month.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'The Little Things review – Denzel Washington killer thriller is a big mess',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'There’s a self-serious portent to the drab serial killer thriller The Little Things, a smug sense of grandiosity informing us that it’s not only more substantial than the average stalk-n-stab schlock, but that it’s going somewhere we might not expect, ending with gravity rather than gristle. To its credit, the film, from The Blind Side writer-director John Lee Hancock, does find itself in slightly unconventional territory in its rushed finale but it’s not a place that’s either satisfying or smart enough to warrant the hushed solemnity that precedes it. It’s a film trapped between a low- and a highbrow version of a story we know all too well, landing firmly in the middle of the road.   Related: Palmer review – Justin Timberlake aims for redemption in familiar drama   With elements of Seven and Zodiac in the mix, arguably the film it most resembles is Insomnia, both the Norwegian original and Christopher Nolan’s excellent remake, its very title recalling a key recurring line about focusing on the small things during an investigation (Hancock insists any comparisons are coincidental with the first draft of the script written back in 1993). In what feels like an adaptation of a potboiler but is actually an original story, deputy sheriff “Deke” (Denzel Washington) finds himself unavoidably dragged back into the thrust of a case he’s not supposed to be involved in (after an admittedly effective Silence of the Lambs-esque cold open). Once a celebrated member of the force, with age he’s found himself pushed to the back, lumped with grunt work over anything more rewarding. But when another young woman is murdered, he’s unable to resist, much to the chagrin of Jimmy (Rami Malek), the point guy on the case. The story also interweaves with an unsolved case from Deke’s past as well as a local stranger (Jared Leto) who may or may not be involved.    Maybe if Hancock’s film had been produced back in the early 90s, it would have at least felt like a more admirably serious-minded riposte to a sub-genre that often devolves into silliness. But at a time when even small-screen procedurals have perma-frowned detectives who spend more time haunted by their past than actually solving crimes in the present, it all feels a little too familiar and a little too minor. As a slow, meditative character-driven drama, it’s too shallow and as a dark, disturbing serial killer thriller, it’s too boring and so quite who this film is for remains a bigger mystery than the one at its centre. As probably the most reliable leading man currently working in Hollywood, Washington can put a shine on even the dullest of material and while he’s no doubt stretched here, he avoids a mere sleepwalk and singlehandedly helps muster up just enough interest to drag us through. His character is mostly standard issue, but it’s a sturdy, accomplished turn, the kind that only he can do quite this well, yet his other two Oscar-winning co-stars struggle. Playing a dogged LAPD detective with the same otherworldly strangeness that won him plaudits for Mr Robot and Bohemian Rhapsody (and makes him a perfect choice for a Bond villain), Malek is awkwardly ill-suited for the role, a performance so discordant, it makes one question the actor’s long-term versatility and just how Hollywood will best make use of him. While Leto certainly looks the part of “potential killer of women” with his pale sunken skin and greasy long hair, his line delivery is so embarrassingly unsubtle that he might as well have walked off the set of a Hammer horror parody, never convincing us that he’s playing anything other than an Evil Movie Villain. That juicy killer-cop interplay, the spiky cat and mouse game that drives films such as this, just isn’t really there, Hancock struggling to differentiate his film from the many others that have come before, as admirably hard as Washington tries. That aforementioned ending, while theoretically interesting, just doesn’t land with the impact Hancock seems to think it does, a big swing that misses. Part of me admires him for it, but it’s such an empty coda presented with such weight, urging us to take what’s mostly a rather rote serial killer movie with awards-worthy seriousness, that it ultimately annoys (what it says about cops is also rather uneasy at this, or frankly any, moment). There are little things here that work but the big problems are impossible to ignore.  The Little Things is released on HBO Max and in cinemas in the US on 29 January and in the UK on 12 February \\n',\n",

       "  'title': \"After 75-year-old dies from attack, alarm increases in Oakland's Asian community \",\n",
       "  'full_article': 'A 75-year-old man from Hong Kong died in Oakland, California, on Thursday, after being robbed and assaulted by a man police said had a history of victimizing elderly Asian people.  Pak Ho had been taking his early morning walk on Tuesday, authorities said, when a man approached him to forcibly rob him. In the course of the robbery, the man allegedly punched Ho, causing him to fall to the ground, hit his head and suffer a traumatic brain injury.  Police on Thursday arrested Teaunte Bailey, 26, in connection with the robbery. Police said that through their investigation, they “learned that the suspect has a history of victimizing elderly Asian people”. In addition to Ho’s death, prosecutors also charged Bailey with the robbery and assault of a 72-year-old Asian man at an Oakland senior care home in February. Authorities said Bailey allegedly broke into the senior living apartment, and shoved the victim while saying “money, money” at him, before leaving with the victim’s phone and numerous other items from the home.   Related: Why has there been a rise in anti-Asian hate crime in the US?   “I’m at a loss for words,” said LeRonne Armstrong, Oakland police chief, in a statement. “Our elders should be protected, not the victim of a deadly assault.” Bailey’s arrest comes amid reports of anti-Asian violence, particularly against Asian elders, across the country. Earlier this year, an 84-year-old Thai man, Vicha Ratanapakdee, was killed in a seemingly unprovoked attack in San Francisco. Anti-Asian sentiments, fueled for years by the Trump administration’s trade war with China, exploded with the pandemic and Donald Trump’s bigoted usage of “China virus” and “kung flu”. Advocates and community organizers have called for action and more awareness of anti-Asian hate, as well as unity between different communities in the face of racial divisions. Oakland’s Chinatown, in particular, has experienced a spate of robberies and assaults in the past few weeks, including an incident in which a man shoved three individuals to the sidewalk. “It’s just been one after the other,” said Carl Chan, president of Oakland’s Chinatown chamber of commerce, to the Guardian. “It’s been so difficult.” Chan said the Bay Area’s Asian community feels unheard and unprotected, frequently complaining about the same individuals coming back into their neighborhoods to rob their stores and victimize their elders. Yet they still keep returning, and their community members keep getting hurt, Chan said. Chan is frustrated. To the community, these attacks feel like hate crimes, Chan said, even though authorities haven’t qualified any of the assaults as such – by definition, a hate crime is a crime motivated by prejudice of a certain group, and he wonders how someone could repeatedly target one community if that person was not fueled by hatred of that community. “All the crimes being committed by the same suspect, coming back over and over and over again, how can we not believe that is a hate crime?” he asked. Chan spoke briefly with Ho’s three daughters, whom he described as heartbroken and hurt over their father’s death. He said they were now especially concerned about the safety of community elders. “People are facing one pandemic, we are facing two, and this is probably worse,” Chan said. “We can take a vaccine. But when we’re Asian, we have a big target on our front, our back, everywhere.”\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'IOC under fire after ‘dismissing’ claims of genocide against Uighurs in China',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'The International Olympic Committee is facing fresh criticism from human rights groups who have accused it of hiding behind political neutrality to stage the Beijing Winter Olympics in a country that is “actively committing a genocide”. A number of representatives of the No Beijing 2022 campaign said on Friday that they had met the IOC last October to give detailed insight into the abuses being faced by Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang province, as well as in Hong Kong and Tibet, and urge them to move the Games – but left feeling the IOC had “completely dismissed our experiences and sufferings”. More than one million Uighurs are believed to be in re-education camps, and on Thursday the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, confirmed that “the genocide against Uighur Muslims” is something that would be a topic of discussion when US officials meet China directly next week. There have been growing calls for a boycott of Beijing 2022 because of the human rights abuses. But Zumretay Arkin, the program and advocacy manager at the World Uyghur Congress, said the IOC had dismissed her concerns.   Related: IOC reveals China has offered vaccines to Tokyo and Beijing Olympic athletes   “When we met with the IOC in October, we asked them to listen to our voices but instead they completely dismissed our experiences and sufferings,” she said. “They conveniently hedge behind political neutrality when it comes to China. “They also repeatedly told us that the IOC’s mission was to create a better world – a world with absolutely no discrimination based on race, religion, gender, sexual orientation,” she added. “A better world to us means a free and democratic world where there are no camps, no forced labour, no cultural and religious repression, no arbitrary arrest, no police brutality. A better world is a world without genocide. “Our question was simple, does the IOC accept hosting the Olympic Games in a country that is actively committing a genocide? The answer we received was also very simple. Yes, the IOC is willing to host genocidal Olympic Games.” Frances Hui, a Hong Kong activist in exile, said she had a similar experience when meeting the IOC. “I talked about the fact that more than 10,000 protesters in Hong Kong were arrested in just a year, and the fact that China is violating international human rights obligations. And the first thing we heard from the IOC is: ‘It is a very complicated world.’ “And I asked again: ‘How are you going to legitimise a Games in a country practising genocide and murder?’ and the IOC again replied to me: ‘It’s a complex world.’ “Ironically, that is the same kind of rhetoric that people from China always tell me when I bring up the fact that two million Uighur workers are in camps,” she added. “When I talk about Tibetans as having their lands occupied by China, all they say is: ‘It’s complicated.’ But no, it’s not complicated.” However, the IOC president, Thomas Bach, insisted one of the key principles of the Olympic charter is political neutrality – adding that the IOC is not equipped to solve all the world’s problems. “We are taking this very seriously,” he said. “But we are not a super world government where the IOC can solve or even address issues for which the UN security council, G7 and G20 has no solution. “We have to fulfil our role and to live up to our responsibilities within our area of responsibilities, and the governments have to live up to their responsibilities in their remits. “Human rights and labour rights and others will be part of the host city contract. And on this, we are working very closely with the organising committee that we are also monitoring. This includes, for instance, supply chains or labour rights, and their freedom of press and many other issues.” Bach said a boycott of the Winter Olympics over China’s human rights abuses would not work. “We can only repeat and give advice to learn from history – a boycott of the Olympic Games has never achieved anything,” he said. “Be mindful of the boycott in Moscow in 1980 because of the intervention of the Soviet army in Afghanistan. The Soviet army withdrew from Afghanistan in 1989 – nine years after. “So it really served nothing but punishing the athletes and then led to the counter-boycott in Los Angeles. It also has no logic, why would you punish the athletes from your own country if you have a dispute with athletes from another country? This just makes no real sense. The athletes would be the ones who are suffering.”\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'Jamaal Lascelles snatches point for Newcastle to deny Aston Villa',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Jamaal Lascelles is the sort of centre-half who likes to lead by example. Newcastle United’s captain most definitely subscribes to the view that when the going gets tough, the tough get going and, deep in stoppage time, he re-emphasised his importance to Steve Bruce’s side. Minutes earlier Ciaran Clark had scored a freakish own goal which threatened to be calamitous in Newcastle’s struggle to avoid relegation but, by meeting Jacob Murphy’s left-wing cross and powering a bullet header beyond Emiliano Martínez, Lascelles salvaged a potentially vital point. It is no exaggeration to say that equaliser might well have saved Bruce from the sack but his, and his side’s position, remain precarious. They stand 16th, only two points ahead of both 18th placed Fulham – who play Manchester City on Saturday – and 17th placed Brighton – who face Southampton on Sunday before hosting Newcastle next weekend.   Related: Newcastle v Aston Villa: Premier League – live!   Outwardly at least, Bruce remains upbeat. “It was a hideous goal to concede, a bit of a fluke but we showed the desire to get back into the game,” said the former Villa manager. “There’s still 10 games to go and I’m convinced we’ll be okay. There’s no question managing Newcastle is difficult. There’s a huge spotlight - but that’s the way it should be and I’m ready for the challenge.” St James’ Park may have been virtually empty but the handful congregated inside clapped as loudly as possible during a heartfelt pre-kick-off minute’s applause for Glenn Roeder, who died two weeks ago. Had the ground been full it would undoubtedly have been an emotional occasion as fans paid tribute to a much loved former captain and manager but it is now more than a year since the turnstiles last closed here. The absence of supporters has arguably kept Bruce in a job and home season ticket holders would doubtless have been unimpressed as Villa began in determinedly zealous mode, winning virtually every second ball. Nonetheless Joelinton really should have scored in the 14th minute after connecting with Jonjo Shelvey’s through pass and sidestepping Tyrone Mings. The £40m Brazilian was left with only Martínez to beat but hesitated at the vital moment, taking one touch too many and permitting Ezri Konsa to make an intelligently timed interception. Both sides were without injured attacking catalysts – Jack Grealish in Villa’s case and Callum Wilson, Allan Saint-Maximin and Miguel Almirón in Newcastle’s – and their absence explained the under-employment of both goalkeepers. Although Martin Dubravka expertly parried Trezeguet’s angled shot after the forward dribbled past Paul Dummett, Newcastle’s keeper was generally well protected by a highly efficient defence. Bruce’s problems lay further forward, specifically in an attacking department where Joelinton’s industry could not camouflage the general shortage of improvisation and incision. If the effort and sometimes almost painful endeavour on view was creditable, the lack of elan suggested Villa may have hit a ceiling in their clamber up the table. Admittedly a Konsa header flashed across the face of goal and Clark did extremely well to block Bertrand Traoré’s fierce shot but Matt Targett was slightly fortunate not to head an own goal after Joelinton’s cross caught him unawares. Meanwhile Martínez looked mightily relieved to see Murphy’s shot rebound off the bar. “That was the best opportunity of the night,” said Bruce. According to the so-called immutable law of the ex it is not uncommon for footballers to score against their old clubs but when Ollie Watkins’s header took a hefty deflection off Clark, the former Villa defender appeared to have registered the winner for his old employers. Clark and Lascelles are close pals and the latter delighted in easing his friend’s misery by heading arguably the most important goal of his career. It left Dean Smith sanguine. “We didn’t deserve to win,” said Villa’s manager. “It was a very scrappy game, we have a few players short on confidence and we’re not creating chances.”\\n',\n",

Speaking on the anniversary of the suspension of England’s top league, Masters reflected on the impact of the pandemic on football and looked forward to the return of fans, with the aspiration being a “normal Premier League” from the start of next season. “It’s been a hell of a journey,” Masters said. “   Related: Sign of the times: why English clubs are turning to high-interest US loans | David Conn   We had to get the 2019-20 season finished.

       "  'title': 'Sarah Everard: Met police officer charged with kidnap and murder',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'A serving Metropolitan police officer has been charged with kidnapping Sarah Everard from a London street as she walked home and then murdering her.  PC Wayne Couzens was charged on Friday following an extensive investigation by homicide detectives. He will appear at Westminster magistrates court on Saturday for his first hearing, the start of the process that leads to a full trial for murder. In a day of fast-moving developments, the Met announced that human remains found in woodland in Ashford, Kent, on Wednesday had been formally identified as the 33-year-old marketing executive. The decision to charge Couzens, 48, was made by lawyers from the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), which authorises criminal proceedings in England and Wales. Rosemary Ainslie, head of special crime at the CPS, said: “Following a referral of evidence by the Metropolitan police related to the death of Sarah Everard, the CPS has authorised the police to charge Wayne Couzens with murder and kidnapping. “The function of the CPS is not to decide whether a person is guilty of a criminal offence, but to make fair, independent and objective assessments about whether it is appropriate to present charges to a court to consider.”  The Met said that hundreds of its officers were working on the investigation, supported by colleagues from Kent police. Couzens was arrested at his home on Tuesday in Deal, Kent. He had previously worked at a garage run by his family in the county. After the announcement of the charging of one of their officers, the Met revealed that he had been with the force for just over two years, starting as a local officer before being transferred to the unit guarding embassies in the capital. In a statement the Met said: “[Couzens’] first posting was to south area, where he joined a response team covering the Bromley area. He then moved to the parliamentary and diplomatic protection command on 1 February 2020, where his primary role was on uniformed patrol duties of diplomatic premises, mainly a range of embassies.” Everard went missing after leaving a friend’s house in Clapham, south London, at around 9pm. She is believed to have walked through Clapham Common on her way home to Brixton, a journey that should have taken around 50 minutes.  Her disappearance triggered a police investigation in which detectives scoured CCTV, video doorbell and bus camera footage for any clue as to what might have happened to her. Video taken from a doorbell camera captured Everard on the A205 Poynders Road walking towards Tulse Hill – the last known sighting of her alive.  Six days after she was last seen, the Met announced on 9 March that a serving officer had been arrested over her disappearance. Couzens was first arrested on suspicion of kidnap, and the next day arrested on suspicion of murder.  Also arrested with Couzens on Tuesday at the same location was a woman aged in her 30s on suspicion of aiding an offender. She has been released on bail until mid-April. The Met confirmed that for the second time since his arrest, Couzens had been found to have sustained a head injury in his cell at a London police station, which is covered by CCTV, and had been taken to a hospital for treatment. With vigils protesting against violence against women planned for this weekend – which police are warning may breach lockdown rules – Met assistant commissioner Nick Ephgrave tried to heal any breach with sections of the community that the force serves, and said: “I know that the public feel hurt and angry about what has happened and those are sentiments that I share personally and I know my colleagues here at Scotland Yard and across the Met share as well. “I also recognise the wider concerns that are being raised quite rightly about the safety of women in public spaces in London and also elsewhere in the country. This organisation and the men and women in it remain committed to protecting Londoners, wherever they are in this city. That commitment is undiminished by these events and if anything that commitment is strengthened by these tragic circumstances.” The Met said extra patrols would be ordered on to the streets to offer reassurance. Investigators are still appealing for information as they continue collecting evidence. A postmortem examination will try to determine the cause of death. In a statement, Sarah’s family have told of their loss and the joy she brought to the lives of her family and friends: “Sarah was bright and beautiful – a wonderful daughter and sister. She was kind and thoughtful, caring and dependable. She always put others first and had the most amazing sense of humour. “She was strong and principled and a shining example to us all. We are very proud of her and she brought so much joy to our lives. “We would like to thank our friends and family for all their support during this awful time and we would especially like to thank Sarah’s friends, who are working tirelessly to help.”\\n',\n",

       "  'full_article': 'In that golden decade when Team Sky and British Cycling won almost everything in sight, their media acolytes would often attribute their success to marginal gains, the pursuit of microscopic advantages in myriad areas, right down to washing hands before entering a building. However, a different form of handwashing took place after a medical tribunal in Manchester dispensed its guilty verdict against the former Team Sky and British Cycling doctor Richard Freeman for ordering banned testosterone “knowing or believing” it was for an unnamed rider.

And while it might sound a strange thing to say about a tribunal that has already lasted 765 days, this is not the end, nor even the beginning of the end. To borrow from Winston Churchill, it is perhaps the end of the beginning. Three crucial questions remain. First, who was the rider? Second, who else knew? And finally, was Team Sky and British Cycling’s success down to marginal gains – or were medical ones involved too? Clearly, Dr Freeman lied repeatedly – including to UK Anti-Doping investigators over ordering testosterone in 2011 – although there was no direct evidence in the 46-page summary of the case that he had doped a rider. Instead it seems the tribunal appears to have decided that Freeman had told so many falsehoods that his claims that he bought 30 sachets of Testogel for Sutton as he was being bullied by him should also be rejected. The botched cover-up didn’t help. At the end of the General Medical Council’s case against Freeman, Simon Jackson QC painted a picture of an ambitious doctor driven to take risks – and prepared to break anti-doping rules to succeed. “There is a truism in life that it isn’t the lie that gets you, it’s the cover-up. And what a cover-up it has been,” Jackson said. It was impossible to disagree. But, watching Freeman – who has suffered from stress and serious mental problems which delayed the case – in the dock it was hard to believe that he had acted as a lone wolf. Indeed the GMC appeared to accept this point, too, given it claimed he was working with “sleepers” in Team Sky and British Cycling who had previous knowledge of doping.    Richard Freeman in a 2018 interview with the BBC. It has been difficult to believe he had acted as a lone wolf. Photograph: BBC Sport   The mind is also cast back to the incident that started this grim affair – the mystery “Jiffy bag” delivered from British Cycling’s headquarters in Manchester to the Team Sky bus at the 2011 Critérium du Dauphiné. We still don’t know for sure what it contained, despite Sir Dave Brailsford telling parliament that it contained Fluimucil, a legal decongestant. Strangely we never heard from Brailsford at this hearing, despite him leading both organisations in 2011. Indeed, Freeman’s QC, Mary O’Rourke, noted that Brailsford was “the spectre missing at these proceedings”. It was an evocative image, and a fair point. As she said he “would have been able to answer an awful lot of questions about what was going on at British Cycling and Team Sky. Yet he was never called.” The tribunal also reinforced the sense that the rosy picture of marginal gains was rather different from the reality. Not only did Freeman not keep medical records, he lost or destroyed several laptops. He also claimed not to know about the benefits of testosterone – despite being one of the leading sports doctors in the country – and said he had “no knowledge” of the World Anti-Doping Code related to possessing banned substances. Steve Peters, the head of science at British Cycling, also displayed a striking lack of curiosity in not asking why Testogel had been ordered to the velodrome, after being told about the package by the physio Phil Burt, while Shane Sutton, the head coach, spent £6,000 of British Cycling’s money on cosmetic dentistry and was accused by the tribunal of “engaging in bullying behaviour”. For supposedly Rolls-Royce organisations, British Cycling and Team Sky had more than a whiff of the Del Boy. The tribunal made it clear in its summing up that Sutton was a credible witness and did not demand testosterone to treat erectile dysfunction. Yet during the case it heard testimony that he had doped as a rider in 1987 – something Sutton denies – while O’Rourke also suggested: “One possibility [for the Testogel] is that Sutton was getting it for nefarious purposes and had a rider he coached who wanted it.”   Related: Team Sky and British Cycling in dock after Freeman guilty verdict   In a statement after the guilty verdict, Sutton stressed neither he nor Brailsford knew about the testosterone order. “I think it’s important to find out who the doctor ordered it for,” added Sutton. “Hopefully that will emerge from the investigation by UK Anti-Doping.” On that, at least, most parties will agree. It was Sutton, of course, who provided the most shocking moment of the hearings, when he denied using Testogel for impotence. “I would have no problem in telling you it was for me,” he said. “You are telling the press I can’t get a hard-on – my wife wants to testify that you are a bloody liar.” Frustratingly there were other interesting lines of inquiry that were not pursued. O’Rourke, for instance, revealed she had written to Damian Collins MP – the author of a damning digital, culture, media and sport select committee report into British Cycling and Team Sky – because she had “been given to believe he received a quantity of information which did not get published which related to Mr Sutton”. She also claimed the Daily Mail had a “witness statement or affidavit” signed by Sutton. That was held in the managing editor of the newspaper’s safe as “an insurance policy against any potential claims for defamation by Sir Bradley Wiggins, Freeman or Sir Dave Brailsford”. But again, we got no further. Despite the guilty verdict it was also hard not to feel some sympathy for Freeman, especially when he detailed how the pressure of the allegations against him had taken its toll when he met Sky chiefs in Canary Wharf in 2017. “I was on my own, living alone, isolated,” he told the tribunal. “I started drinking again, taking more sedative medication. I was on a slippery slope. I was due to give evidence to the DCMS select committee but I found it very daunting. “I went down to see James Murdoch and Team Sky with Mr Eastwood to be briefed at an imposing building at Canary Wharf. Mike Morgan was there – who is a big person in sports law – and Rupert Murdoch’s lawyer was over from Australia. It was very tense. Pressurised. They wanted to know how I would answer certain questions. I broke down in tears and couldn’t go on.” There was, at least, a neat bit of symmetry on Friday – as a story that began with revelations about a Jiffy bag being delivered to the Team Sky bus, ended with its former chief doctor being left under one.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'Team Sky and British Cycling in dock after Freeman guilty verdict',\n",
       "  'full_article': \"Team Sky and British Cycling’s successes over the past decade have been left shrouded in suspicion after their former chief doctor Richard Freeman was found guilty of ordering banned testosterone “knowing or believing” it was for an unnamed rider to improve their performance. In a devastating verdict that will send shockwaves through British sport, Freeman was also found guilty of concealing his conduct by orchestrating an elaborate cover-up after purchasing “a doping ‘drug of choice’ for his sport”. Immediately after the verdict, there were calls to find and identify the rider involved – while Clive Efford, a member of the digital, culture, media and sport select committee, called for Sir Dave Brailsford to be suspended by Ineos Grenadiers pending a full investigation. “Until this is cleared up, all those involved shouldn’t be anywhere near the sport,” he added.   Related: Marginal gains or medical gains? Questions remain after Freeman's guilty verdict   Freeman, who worked for Team Sky and British Cycling between 2009 and 2017, had already admitted to 18 charges against him including purchasing banned testosterone, lying to the UK Anti-Doping Agency and keeping haphazard records. But on Friday he also was found guilty of three more charges relating to the delivery of 30 sachets of Testogel – banned in and out of competition – to British Cycling and Team Sky headquarters in Manchester in May 2011. Crucially the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS) said it found Freeman’s claims that he had bought the banned drug for former British Cycling and Team Sky coach Shane Sutton to treat his erectile dysfunction were “implausible”. “As a highly experienced doctor, the reason Dr Freeman claims to have ordered Testogel [to treat Mr Sutton] was unconvincing in itself,” it added. “It stretched credulity that a high-profile, experienced sports doctor would order a potential banned substance under the World Anti-Doping Agency code; yet, despite the significance of this, fail to make a record of the intended patient, the circumstances, and the proposed off-label use. “The tribunal found that Dr Freeman’s account of having ordered the Testogel for Mr Sutton required it to believe too many implausible, unsupported assertions, as well as having to overlook further falsehoods, on the back of those Dr Freeman had already admitted. “The position therefore is this. In May 2011, Dr Freeman, the team doctor for a team of elite cyclists … ordered a doping ‘drug of choice’ for that sport. Upon its arrival he was dishonest about why it had been sent, removed it from the Velodrome, and it was never seen again.” Freeman had claimed last year that he had taken the testosterone home with him and flushed it down the sink but the tribunal noted that they only had his word. “Bearing in mind the breadth of Dr Freeman’s dishonesty and the number of people he had pulled into it, the tribunal found his conduct incapable of innocent explanation,” the MPTS report concluded. “It was clear that, on the balance of probabilities, the inference could properly be drawn that when Dr Freeman placed the order and obtained the Testogel, he knew or believed it was to be administered to an athlete to improve their athletic performance.” The identity of the rider for whom the testosterone was allegedly ordered has never been established, nor did the General Medical Council attempt to prove it. Speaking after the verdict, Sutton admitted the decision had cast a cloud over both Team Sky and British Cycling. “I’m saddened by the whole affair,” he said. “I feel for the doctor; that he ever got into this situation, and I remain disappointed that I was used as a scapegoat. It has caused great pain to both me and my family. But it also saddens me that this episode has cast a huge shadow over the success we enjoyed, both at Team Sky and British Cycling. “I’d like to stress that neither I nor Sir Dave Brailsford knew about the testosterone order,” he added. “But I think it’s important to find out who the doctor ordered it for. Hopefully that will emerge from the investigation by UK Anti-Doping.” The tribunal accepted that Sutton had been a “scratchy and irascible character” who, “when under pressure would indeed engage in bullying behaviour”. However, it said there was no evidence that Sutton had been bullying Freeman in 2011 and they found him a credible witness. The protracted case, which was expected to last a month when it began in February 2019, has dragged on for more than two years. However, Friday’s verdict does not yet mark its end. It will sit again for three days next week to assess whether Freeman’s licence to practice is impaired – and then again in April to deliberate on whether he should lose his doctor’s licence or face any other punishments for his behaviour.   Related: Suspicion stalked Sky but British public swallowed marginal gains story whole   Freeman will also face two UK Anti-Doping charges related to ordering banned testosterone, including possession of a prohibited substance and tampering. In a statement, Ineos Grenadiers – formally Team Sky – admitted that it was “very clear from the tribunal’s report that Freeman had fallen short of the ethical standards required of him as a doctor and acted dishonestly”. But it added: “However the Team does not believe that any athlete ever used or sought to use Testogel or any other performance-enhancing substance. No evidence has been provided that this ever happened or that there has been any wrongdoing by any athlete at any point.” Meanwhile Brian Cookson, the president of British Cycling between 1996 and 2013, called upon Freeman to give a full and frank account to UK Anti-Doping. “In many different ways, my team and I worked long and hard to ensure that success was well-founded on principles of integrity, fair play and competing within the rules, including and especially with respect to anti-doping,” he added. However Damian Collins MP, the former chairman of the digital, culture, media and sport committee, said it posed “major questions for British sport” as well as British Cycling and Team Sky.   Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors’ picks.  “How could the chief doctor for Team Sky and British Cycling order a banned substance ‘knowing or believing’ it was to help a rider cheat the anti-doping rules?” he asked. “Was this a one off, who was the recipient, why was there supposedly no supervision of what he was ordering? This case is not just about the failure of one man to adhere to the rules and the standards expected of him, but a failure at that time of the management of the teams he worked for, including the national governing body of the sport.” Meanwhile Efford said the ruling against Freeman exposed Team Sky’s “zero tolerance” approach to doping as having been “a tissue of lies”. “Dave Brailsford gave reassurances about how clean his teams were and unless he was in full control of what was going on, he couldn’t make those assurances,” he added. Wada said it had noted “with concern” the decision and said it would work to support the authorities in the case “to ensure that all possible lines of enquiry are exhausted.”It added: “A number of questions still remain unanswered, such as the identity of the rider or riders who were the intended recipients of the prohibited substance ordered by Dr Freeman, and who else, if anyone, had knowledge of his actions.”\\n\",\n",

       "  'full_article': \"Police have arrested a woman who was seen assaulting a San Francisco Uber driver in a video that went viral this week. San Francisco police said on Thursday that officers with the Las Vegas police department had arrested Malaysia King, 24, who is accused of attacking Subhakar Khadka after he refused to continue to drive King and two other passengers, one of whom had failed to follow Uber policies and wear a mask during the ride. The incident occurred on Sunday, after Khadka picked up three women in the city. Khadka filmed the video, which appears to show an unmasked woman in the back of the car coughing into Khadka’s face and screaming at him. Seconds later the woman snatches Khadka’s cellphone out of his hand and plucks his mask from his face. She and another passenger threaten to beat up the driver, before, according to Khadka, spraying pepper spray into his car.   Related: Uber driver assaulted by unmasked rider: 'People all over have experienced this'   Police have identified the two women as King, and 24-year-old Arna Kimiai. King was arrested on four charges, including assault and battery and assault with a caustic chemical. Officials said that Kimiai’s legal counsel has indicated she plans to turn herself over to police. In the days following the video’s circulation, Kimiai has said on social media that she was afraid that Khadka was going to kick the trio out of his car on the freeway or in an unfamiliar area. Kimiai has not returned repeated requests for comment in recent days. Khadka told the Guardian on Wednesday that before the altercation, he had stopped at a gas station so one of the three passengers could buy a mask. When she was inside, he said, the other two riders began taunting and threatening him. “Before the girl came back with her mask I had to listen to taunts about how they could shoot me in the face and call their boyfriends and cousins on me,” Khadka said. “They talked about how small my testicles are because of my race. They called me a goofy-ass N-word after every sentence.” Minutes later Khadka turned on his camera. Once the riders got out of the car, he said, King sprayed pepper-spray into the vehicle.  Thank you @SFPD for your quick work, and for standing up for drivers. Anti-Asian hate and violence is shocking and heartbreaking—and it must stop. When one community is being attacked, we are all being attacked. #StopAAPIHate https://t.co/Jy64kldYBs— dara khosrowshahi (@dkhos) March 12, 2021  Uber’s CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi, thanked San Francisco authorities in a tweet on Thursday, condemning the incident as an act of anti-Asian hate. Khadka’s assault comes as the San Francisco Bay Area reckons with attacks against Asian residents. A 75-year-old Asian man in Oakland died on Thursday after being assaulted and robbed earlier this week.\\n\",\n",

       "  'title': 'Yellow review –  a gripping epic about fascism in Belgium',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Director Luk Perceval’s Sorrows of Belgium trilogy charts three dark chapters in the nation’s history, starting with colonial oppressions in the Congo in Black (produced by NTGent in 2019) and ending with the Brussels terrorist attacks of 2016 in Red (yet to be staged). The second instalment, Yellow, dramatises the rise of the fascist party Rex, which led to collaboration with Nazi occupiers. What is immediately arresting in NTGent’s live-stream, with English subtitles, is the cinematic quality of the production. It is exquisitely filmed by Daniel Demoustier in the theatre, though not always on the stage. Shot almost entirely in black and white with some intermittent hues of yellow, it seems variously like a dance and a series of sorrowful tableaux of human suffering and collective delusion. Camera angles draw us into the roused faces of Belgian fascists, circling them dizzily as they spit out their rhetoric, and then drawing away to show them as a choreographed ensemble. Annette Kurz’s set design seems more like a moving painting, with the actors often performing on or around a table that serves as a miniature stage. The full cycle of the war is shown, from the rise of the Rex party (“Hitler will not forget about the Flemish,” says one character) to the eastern front and finally the bursting of the fascist bubble back at home. It is history told through family members and everymen, from the bookish and absent Jef, who is pushed into enlisting for war, to his father (Peter Seynaeve), mother (Chris Thys) and sister, Mie (Lien Wildemeersch). Their testimonies are combined with narrated letters written by Jef from the frontline, and there is a Jewish woman, Channa (Maria Shulga), who appears occasionally to tell her own story of persecution and escape – though frustratingly, not enough of it.    Courageous storytelling … Yellow. Photograph: Fred Debrock   The Flemish family are not unlike the villagers of Edgar Reitz’s Heimat: eminently ordinary, their lives interrupted by ideology and war. As they fall under the spell of fascism, they are shown to be delirious, dancing manically, their movements erratic and puppet-like. And then they become small and suffering again, as that spell is broken. Alongside them is the story of Léon Degrelle (Valéry Warnotte), the founder of Rex, and Otto Skorzeny (Philip Leonhard Kelz), an Austrian SS officer whose zeal vividly brings the “cult of the Führer” to life as they speak, with almost childlike wonder, of shaking hands with Hitler or seeing him at rallies. Peter van Kraaij’s script (with contributions from Steven Heene and Margit Niederhuber) resists traditional storytelling and as captivating and intense as the effects may be, it becomes opaque and too impressionistic at times. It never loses its atmosphere but because of its many narrative ellipses, the historical detail is hard to follow for those who are not familiar with it. The emotional voltage nonetheless remains, conjured by Ted Stoffer’s movement, Sam Gysel’s stunning score (from martial drumming to melancholic piano) and the actors’ extraordinary performances, which give it an epic and tragic scale. NTGent intends to stage the production as a live performance in May but this filmed version is its own extraordinary achievement.  Yellow: The Sorrows of Belgium II. REX is next streamed on 19 March. \\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'Rachael Blackmore on crest of a wave going into Cheltenham',\n",
       "  'full_article': \"When Shark Hanlon booked Rachael Blackmore, a 21-year-old conditional without a winner under Rules to her name, to ride Stowaway Pearl in a handicap hurdle at Thurles in February 2011, he thought it best that she did not know there was more than just the prize money at stake. “At the time, she wasn’t working for me,” Hanlon said this week. “It was [leading jockey] Davy Russell who recommended her. “We were having a few quid on the horse that day and I didn’t want to tell her. I remember saying to her: ‘Listen, when you’re going across the top, kick and don’t look back.’ She came down to the last and she couldn’t resist, she had to have a little look back to see how far it was, and she was 15 lengths in front.”   Related: BHA says Murphy's return from drugs ban delayed by failure to have tests   With hindsight, it seems fair to say that had Blackmore known the money was down, it is unlikely to have made much difference. A decade on from her first winner at Thurles, she is one of the National Hunt weighing room’s elite riders, with 12 Grade One wins and still in with a chance to finish the season as Ireland’s champion over jumps. Blackmore can also look forward to her best book of rides at the Cheltenham Festival next week, including Honeysuckle, the favourite for Tuesday’s Champion Hurdle, and A Plus Tard, third‑favourite for the Gold Cup. She is only 12-1, too, to finish the meeting as its leading rider for the first time. Yet there were times, as there are for any young conditional, when as Hanlon puts it, “people thought it was madness” for Blackmore to take aim at the summit. Katy Walsh and Nina Carberry were exceptional and successful riders a decade ago, but both rode as amateurs and for families with a racing heritage that stretched back generations. Blackmore had no family connection to racing to put her on the first rung of the ladder, at a time when no female jump jockey had turned professional in Ireland since the mid-1980s.    Rachael Blackmore on A Plus Tard, her ride in this year’s Cheltenham Gold Cup. Photograph: Michael Steele/Getty Images   Attitudes have changed in the decade since, something Blackmore’s sustained success at the highest level has helped to accelerate. But she has had to work tirelessly to achieve what might feel to some like almost an overnight success, with a further 11 Grade One winners since Minella Indo took the Albert Bartlett Novice Hurdle at Cheltenham two seasons ago. Hanlon played a major part in setting Blackmore on her way. “She rode her first bumper winner for me, her first hurdle winner for me, her first chase winner and her first point‑to-point winner,” he says. “She was always a great girl, always very dedicated, and a great worker, unreal. She had a lot of ability and I knew she had it and she had the heart to try hard. That’s what got her where she is, and she’s a hardy, she doesn’t mind the falls. “I found she was unreal at getting horses to jump. That was one of her big, big plusses for me and I’d say for everyone else now.”     While Hanlon was Blackmore’s biggest supporter in the early days, it is her association with Henry de Bromhead since the spring of 2018 that has moved her up and on into the elite. All her Grade One winners have been for De Bromhead, including one aboard A Plus Tard, the horse who could make her the first female rider to win the Cheltenham Gold Cup on Friday. Her ride on Honeysuckle to win last year’s Mares’ Hurdle, meanwhile, was one of the best of the Festival, as Blackmore seized the initiative along the inside rail, turning in before holding off the charging favourite, Benie Des Dieux, up the hill.   Related: The day the turf stood still: looking back at sport's sudden shutdown    “She didn’t really get our job,” De Bromhead says. “She rode her way into it. I never really offered it to her. Eddie O’Leary [racing manager to Michael O’Leary’s Gigginstown Stud] suggested I should try using her when we were in Aintree in 2018. “That was April; in May she started riding a few for us, and she kept winning and that was it. She’s brilliant at getting them to jump but she’s an all-rounder too, she’s great at judging pace, she’s got it all really. “Of the bigger days, her ride on Honeysuckle in the Mares’ was brilliant, but there would be many, many more, just day-to-day ones. “She’s very stylish and out in the country there’s the lengths she’d be making at a fence, which would also mean that you’d be in a good rhythm and a good tempo.” Hanlon admits some of his owners needed some persuading to use a female rider on their horse a decade ago. “When I told people I was wanting to give her a ride on this horse or that,” he says, “they didn’t go against me, but they mightn’t have been very happy. “But she never gave a horse a bad ride and she’s been very hard on herself. If she thought she’d given a horse a bad ride, she’d be disgusted with herself. Everyone is born with a talent and she’s born to ride horses.”\\n\",\n",

       "  'title': 'Will I have to wear a mask after getting the Covid vaccine? The science explained',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Public health authorities want people to keep wearing masks and social distancing, even after they receive a vaccine. This might seem counterintuitive – after all, if someone gets a vaccine, aren’t they protected from the coronavirus? The answer is complicated: the vast majority of people who are vaccinated will be protected from Covid-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. However, vaccinated people may still be able to transmit the virus, even though they do not display any symptoms. “We know now the vaccines can protect, but what we haven’t had enough time to really understand is – does it protect from spreading?” said Avery August, professor of immunology at Cornell University. That is because the the SARS-CoV-2 virus may still colonize the respiratory tract, even as systemic immune cells protect the overall body from the disease it causes – Covid-19. Here is how this works:     When can I stop wearing a mask? Hold on to your mask(s) for the foreseeable future. Right now, there are several unknowns, which make mask-wearing and social distancing important to protect the wider community. First, scientists do not know how Covid-19 vaccines may protect against asymptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (as explained above). There are promising signs – but research remains incomplete. Researchers also do not know how long Covid-19 vaccines may protect people from the virus. Scientists will also be closely watching how evolutionary changes in the virus, or variants, impact the effectiveness of vaccines. Researchers have already found efficacy of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine was reduced in South Africa, where the B1351 variant is present. However, the most important factor may be the extent to which eligible adults accept the vaccine. Children are able to spread the disease, but not eligible for the vaccine; some people may be too immune-compromised to take it; and others may face bureaucratic barriers to vaccination. What’s the point of getting the vaccine if I still have to wear a mask? Think of mask-wearing and social distancing as a continuum of risk-mitigation strategies, which are in place while scientists conduct research, more and more people get vaccinated, and the prevalence of Covid-19 goes down. For example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said people can gather indoors, without masks, with other fully vaccinated people. People are considered “fully vaccinated” two weeks after they receive their last vaccine. Those same people then need to be conscientious about social distancing and mask-wearing in public, as they could potentially transmit the disease in the wider community. The hope is that as more and more of the public is vaccinated, fewer people will have severe cases of Covid-19, and the pressure on the health system will decline with the prevalence of the disease. “Hopefully we can get a majority of the population vaccinated,” said Dr Bruce Y Lee, a professor of health policy at the City University of New York’s School of Public Health. “That’s when we can start talking about moving toward normal.” When will we have these answers? Studies on the extent to which vaccines protect against transmission are continuing, and promising, but incomplete. It is unlikely the vaccines will provide complete, or “sterilizing”, protection. Only a handful of vaccines are able to make that claim, including for example the smallpox vaccine. However, if a vaccine significantly reduced transmission, it would be very good news for the world’s ability to contain the virus. Under normal circumstances, these kinds of questions might have been answered in years-long vaccine clinical trials. In this emergency situation, stopping the disease was a more important goal, and available vaccines do that very effectively. “We would probably know as more and more people get vaccinated, somewhere near the middle of September,” said August. Importantly though, vaccines do not necessarily need to provide complete protection to help fight the pandemic. “If everyone is vaccinated then there is less virus around,” said August.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'Police told they cannot waive Covid rules for Sarah Everard vigils',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Police forces have been warned not to allow vigils planned by thousands of people in dozens of towns and cities to honour the memory of Sarah Everard this weekend amid frustration about “endemic” levels of violence against women and girls. The Guardian has learned that the National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC) told forces across England and Wales on Friday that they could not waive lockdown guidance banning gatherings, after it was discussed with the policing minister, Kit Malthouse. The document says that he is “supportive”. But one force has decided that it will allow vigils as long as they are socially distanced and people wear masks, the Guardian has learned, reasoning that the outdoor events would pose little risk of spreading infection. Vigils were planned on Clapham Common, south London, and in at least two dozen other towns and cities in the wake of the alleged murder of Everard, whose body was identified on Friday in woodland in Kent, more than a week after she vanished on the way to her home in south London.  Map  Whether or not the events would go ahead was hanging in the balance on Friday evening after a judge refused an application by the organisers, Reclaim These Streets, to make “an interim declaration” that any ban on outdoor gatherings under coronavirus regulations was “subject to the right to protest”. But Mr Justice Holgate suggested further communication between organisers and the police could be held “to deal with the application of the regulations and [the rights to freedom of expression and assembly] to this particular event”. In a statement after the ruling, Reclaim These Streets said: “We are pleased that the judge spelled out in a detailed ruling that the law does not prevent the police from permitting and facilitating protest in all circumstances. The judge has made clear that the police must make their own decision about whether the protest can go ahead and that must include a proportionality balancing exercise. “We call on the police to act within the law now and confirm that they will work with us to ensure that the protest can go ahead within the context of the overwhelming public response to Sarah Everard’s death.” However, a statement from the Met urged people to “stay at home or find a lawful and safer way to express your views”. In Scotland, it was announced that in-person vigils paying tribute to Everard, which were due to be held in Edinburgh on Saturday, had been cancelled by organisers in favour of an online-only event Cressida Dick, the Met’s commissioner, visited Clapham Common on Friday evening, walking with police officers and speaking to members of the public in the park. Responding to an outpouring of public anger and fear, the government on Friday reopened its consultation on violence against women and girls to allow the thousands of stories of abuse and violence experienced by women to feed into government policy. Nimko Ali, a government adviser and campaigner on violence against women, said women had experienced the disappearance and death of Everard as a “collective grief”. “It is like our wounds have been reopened, but when a wound opens up, that is a good moment to use antibiotics. This is a moment to use our platforms and our privileges and make sure we bring about change.” Organisers of the vigil in Clapham, near where Everard was last seen, have been locked in a legal battle with the Met police since Thursday, when the force – after initially apparently seeking to work with organisers – said the gathering would be unlawful under current lockdown restrictions. They told the organisers that they could face tens of thousands of pounds in fixed penalty notices and criminal prosecution, the group said.  At the emergency hearing, Holgate also refused to make a declaration that an alleged policy by the Metropolitan police of “prohibiting all protests, irrespective of the specific circumstances” was unlawful.      The NPCC document is a rare attempt to forge a common approach among the 43 forces across England and Wales. It says “we understand the strength of feeling” but stresses that Covid regulations do not allow large gatherings. It says vigils will have to be conducted “in accordance with the law”. Currently two people are allowed to meet for exercise in England. A senior officer on a force that has decided to permit vigils said: “This is a grey area and this is about reasonableness. The rules are far from clear and are yet to be tested in the courts. We have discretion, we choose which laws we enforce and when. If you think we are going to tell people after the alleged murder of a woman [that] you cannot hold a vigil, you are in cloud cuckoo land. People have to use common sense.” In a sign of rising tensions, Labour’s deputy leader, Angela Rayner, added her voice to those calling for vigils to be allowed to go ahead, saying: “Women’s voices must not be silenced.” Rayner said she would like to see the police work with the organisers to ensure that demonstrations could take place safely despite lockdown restrictions. “There’s been an outcry, an outpouring of the long-term issues that many women and many girls face in this country. And that’s the fear of not been able to go out, that fear of being attacked and the domestic violence that has increased,” she told Sky News. “I hope that we can come to a solution where the protest can go ahead in a Covid-safe way, that we can work with the police to make sure that happens because women’s voice cannot be silenced. This is a moment where people need to stand up and listen.” The women’s parliamentary Labour party, which represents female Labour MPs, also backed the planned vigils. Campaigners and women across the UK have called for a societal shift and a policy overhaul to tackle the violence that sees one women killed at a man’s hands every three days, according to the Femicide Census. The past 12 months have seen a global and national increase in domestic violence, and an increase in rape reports even as the number of prosecutions has collapsed. A survey by UN Women UK this week revealed that almost all young women have experienced sexual harassment in public places. Andrea Simon, the director of End Violence Against Women, said the problem was now endemic. “It is well known that men who commit violence against women and girls are known to do so again and again and often against a series of women,” she said. “For this to be a turning point, we need solutions that target the behaviour of perpetrators, not those which focus on the actions of women who are attacked.” The Women’s Equality party has urged all women to share the texts they send to try to keep themselves safe using the #EnoughIsEnough at 9pm on Friday, which they will present to the government. Everard’s disappearance as she walked home at about 9.30pm on 3 March, and the subsequent discovery of her body in woodland in Kent, have led many women to share their personal experiences of harassment and abuse. The Labour MP Stella Creasy, who has campaigned for misogyny to be made a hate crime, said the volume of voices calling for action represented “anger at the violence, abuse and harassment that is so much part of the daily lives of women across the country”. She added: “Making misogyny a hate crime would be a start to changing both the way these crimes are dealt with and the culture of our policing – both actions which are long overdue in a society that wants to ensure everyone is free to live their lives and not under attack simply for being who they are.” A government spokesperson said: “All of our thoughts are with Sarah’s family and friends at this terrible time, and the government recognises why so many women and girls across the country want to pay their respects. We are still in the middle of a pandemic, which is why we urge people to do this safely and to continue to avoid mass gatherings.”  Jessica Leigh from Reclaim These Streets, who is also a Lambeth councillor, said she hoped the tragic events would prompt a national debate. “We hope that this can be the beginning of a conversation about women’s safety and women’s rights.”\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'Trident nuclear warhead numbers set to increase for first time since cold war',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Downing Street’s integrated review of defence and foreign policy is expected next week to signal a potential increase of the number of Trident nuclear warheads for the first time since the end of the cold war. Whitehall sources indicated that a cap on total warhead numbers – currently set at 180 – is expected to increase, although the exact figure is not yet known, in a move that analysts said was diplomatically provocative. The UK’s stockpile of nuclear weapons peaked at about 500 in the late 1970s, but had been gradually decreasing ever since as the perceived threat from the Soviet Union and now Russia had been assumed to be decreasing. The last strategic defence review, in 2015, committed the UK to “reduce the overall nuclear weapon stockpile to no more than 180 warheads” by the mid 2020s – and reducing the numbers of operationally available warheads to 120. Each warhead is estimated to have an explosive power of 100 kilotons. The atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima at the end of the second world war was about 15 kilotons. The full reasons for the anticipated move are not yet clear but it comes amid speculation it is designed to help persuade the US to co-fund aspects of a Trident replacement warhead for the the 2030s. Its costs, too, are uncertain. “If this is confirmed, this would be a highly provocative move,” said David Cullen, the director of the Nuclear Information Service. “The UK has repeatedly pointed to its reducing warhead stockpile as evidence that it is fulfilling its legal duties under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. “If they are tearing up decades of progress in reducing numbers, it will be a slap in the face to the 190 other members of the treaty, and will be regarded as a shocking breach of faith.” Britain has operated its own nuclear weapons since the 1950s but for the past 60 years, following an agreement between the then prime minister, Harold Macmillan, and the then US president, John F Kennedy, the UK has been heavily dependent on US technology. Trident missiles are deployed in four submarines, one of which is continuously at sea to make sure it can strike back in the event of an unprovoked nuclear attack. It relies on an existing US W76 warhead, based on a 1970s design, called Holbrook. However, the W76 is ageing, and the US has proposed developing a more powerful replacement, called the W93. The UK is particularly keen for the US to start work on the W93 and last summer the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, lobbied Congress for the work to go ahead. British MPs voted to renew Trident in principle in 2016, but the Commons is expected to have to vote on a new warhead at some point. In 2016, the Conservatives almost uniformly backed renewal, the SNP voted against, while Labour was split. The MoD has said developing the next generation of Dreadnought submarines to carry the new warhead would cost £30bn plus a £10bn contingency. But officials have so far refused to say how much the warhead would cost. An MoD spokesperson said: “The UK is committed to maintaining its independent nuclear deterrent, which exists to deter the most extreme threats to our national security and way of life. “Replacing the warhead and building four new Dreadnought class submarines are UK sovereign programmes that will maintain the deterrent into the future. We will not comment on speculation about the integrated review, which will be published on Tuesday.”\\n',\n",

       "  'full_article': 'The idea of ‘dopamine dressing’ – wearing clothes that make you feel happier, has been around for several years, but it has reached new heights of relevance in 2021 as we continue to go out less, and feel rotten more often. Feelgood clothes are often reduced to aesthetics – pieces that are bright, poppy or overtly joyful. But an outfit doesn’t have to scream happiness in order to provoke it. We asked seven speakers at the Australian Fashion Summit – part of Melbourne Fashion festival – to share the one piece of clothing that makes them feel most hopeful. Yatu Widders Hunt, founder and curator of @AusIndigenousFashion    Yatu Widders Hunt in her Ngali dress. Photograph: Jimmy Widders Hunt   This dress is from First Nations fashion label Ngali and features the work of Gija artist Lindsay Malay. Growing up in Sydney as a young Aboriginal person, I was always looking for pieces that reflected my contemporary identity, but in a way that was grounded in our cultural traditions. As an adult, I feel like I found that in this dress. It gives me the opportunity to continue our traditions by showcasing the stories and values we hold. It’s also a great conversation starter and a gentle and beautiful way to share who we are as a people. I wore this dress at a fashion event where we were sharing our favourite First Nations fashion pieces and what they represented for us. It was a day of connection and celebration. I feel nothing but joy in my Ngali. Audrey Khaing-Jones, CEO of GlamCorner    Audrey Khaing-Jones in a colourful printed dress from C/Meo Collective.

It was a “pinch me” moment on how far we’ve come in helping reduce fashion waste through rental. I chose to wear the C/Meo Collective dress at the time because it was part of our GlamCorner rental offering, and the shape and print made me feel sophisticated yet fun. I loved the dress so much I bought it at the end of its rental life cycle and it always manages to lift my mood when I wear it.

Photograph: Nathan McGuire   This rust orange shirt by Melbourne based label Handsom is one of my favourite pieces of clothing. I was shopping in their store, spotted the shirt in the sale section of the rack and my eyes lit up. I love a bargain. This piece makes me happy because at the time I had a sharp focus on developing my wardrobe and wanting to buy key pieces that fit my personal style. The colour was perfect and the shirt was made so well. I can dress it up for a night out with mates or make it casual to go out for a coffee. I’ve been able to wear it to many friends’ events and it’s travelled the world with me. This shirt makes me feel confident and comfortable. Our fashion reflects the way we move through the world and this shirt gives me those feelings.

This picture is very recent, taken at the launch of Melbourne Fashion festival at Victoria’s Government House. This wasn’t going to be my immediate choice, and I’m being a little courageous with this choice, but it’s heartfelt. I was recently diagnosed with neck cancer and while I’m grateful to be in remission, like many cancer warriors I’ve taken an ego hit and have some scares to prove it. Wearing this neck scarf was surprisingly powerful. It actually highlighted my vulnerability and gave me some bravado too. Oh, and there’s always a dopamine rush when you’ve got pearly white Common Projects to go with any outfit.

It’s been a core piece in my wardrobe, and reminds me of the time I spent studying at the Accademia Italiana Arte Moda in Florence, Italy. It was such an inspiring time in my life; the art, architecture and food, not to mention the education in tailoring. This piece makes me feel incredibly optimistic and grateful for that wonderful experience. Andie Halas, founding director of Thread Together    Andie Halas, wearing a dress from The Art Club.

I have always admired Heidi – her business sense, her positive attitude and now at this career stage her investment in slow fashion with a focus on sustainability. This dress is a great mix of feminine and masculine – which is my style. A classic dress that is based on the traditional men’s shirting, though with the femininity of fabric and the softness of the ruffle at the waist. This dress makes me feel strong and at ease and I know it will be worn throughout the warmer months and for years to come. It is important to me to buy designs that last the test of time, that become like reliable friends.

It’s not particularly fashionable but I love the message to remain true to who you are. I think it’s a powerful thing, as a woman in Stem and in politics, to remember that I’m not defined by my blonde hair or love of fashion – just like my favourite singer, Dolly Parton.

       "  'full_article': \" Giving [people] more money would do absolutely nothing … probably all it would do is give drug dealers more money and give pubs more money.” – Anne Ruston, minister for families and social services, October 2019  How many people in Australia are starving? I’ve written in articles in the past of my gratitude for the disability support pension and for living in community housing which ensures that my rent is capped at 25% of my income.   Related: Raising Newstart would 'give drug dealers more money', social services minister says   I knew intellectually that nobody could live on the jobseeker payment, that only one or perhaps two houses in Australia are affordable for a single person on jobseeker, but I didn’t have a practical experience of what that could mean. Before I met Rita I didn’t know of anyone personally who was starving to death. Rita is a northern suburban mother, a whistleblower and an ardent activist. She was enticed to her first Anti-Poverty Network meeting on the allure of free pizza. She stayed because she felt the stirrings of community. At the time she was receiving $560 a fortnight and her weekly rent was $251. Yes, that’s right – do the maths. Her rent was $502 a fortnight, leaving her with the magnanimous sum of $58 to last two weeks for everything else (food, medicine, electricity, gas, petrol, etc, etc). She had already burnt through her super and any savings just to attempt the mythical meeting of the ends. Eventually she sold her car for food, then her fridge. (Our collective mordant humour exploded at the very thought when she revealed this to me.) As an activist, Rita is a firecracker. She researches her memes assiduously. Pages of information are distilled into stark messages – felt-tipped black pen scribbled across blank paper. Selfies of her holding statistics and searing questions are peppered across Facebook.   The woman had been slowly starving for the past year and it took three days to fix it   When the Covid supplement was introduced, she rushed out to buy new underwear and then sent a picture of them to Ruston as proof of what she was spending her money on. As the old adage goes, “She is not backwards in coming forwards.” So why didn’t she ask for help? But is that the right question to ask? Surely the onus is not on the less fortunate to beg and kowtow for bread and water? The real question is, “Why didn’t anybody notice?” Perhaps the simplest answer is: “Because things like this shouldn’t happen in Australia.” We’re simply not used to them. It is beyond our ken. None of us in the poverty network, except one, had experience of dealing with people starving to death. So we didn’t recognise the signs. It was M, a fabulous activist in her late 70s with the spirit of a 30-year-old, who finally drew the threads together. As we were coming home from a particularly onerous meeting, she said: “I’m really worried about Rita. I’m frightened she’s starving to death. I’ve seen it in Cambodia.” The slow-spinning cogs of cognitive dissonance began to clatter and whir as my brain went into meltdown. I understood as fact that no one could survive on jobseeker but I could not fathom that I personally knew and was becoming friends with someone who was starving in Australia. The dissonance dissipated and was replaced by invective ire. I began to swear, profusely, then I somehow reined in my inner Boudicca and clicked into fix-it mode instead. “OK – I’ve got stuff in my pantry that I’m not using – have you?” “Yes.” “Right. We do a ring-around and ask people to donate a few cans of non-perishables and we fill her pantry. If her pantry is full then she won’t starve. She may not be eating well, but she’ll be eating something.” M concurred and we discussed tactics. I started to ring everybody I knew. Most people were great. They asked practical things – does she have any food allergies? What won’t she eat? Others were not so accommodating. They questioned her spending, they asked if I’d seen her cupboards. Regardless of the less charitable, it took three days to fill Rita’s pantry. It was that easy. The woman had been slowly starving for the past year and it took three days to fix it. There is still food coming in – the leftover non-perishables have been taken to our shared office space to be used as an emergency stash for anybody who needs it. We’ve called it Rita’s Pantry and intend to make it an ongoing feature of our activism against the war on the poor. None of us have any money. We have no resources except ourselves. If it’s that easy for a few “welfarers” to get together to help someone – then what in all the gods’ names is wrong with our government?   Related: I am living in fear of what life will be like when jobseeker is cut back | Julie Stephen   Allowing poverty to continue is a political choice. The government proved that when it waved its political wand and magically the jobseeker payment was doubled by the addition of the Covid supplement. It’s about priorities and ideological preferences, not a lack of resources. It is also a political choice to plunge more than 1.5 million people back into abject impecunity when the supplement ends, thus condemning them to homelessness and hunger. The cruelty of it is breathtaking. I asked Rita why she thought she couldn’t ask for help. She said she had spent her life caring for others as a mother, as a carer. Now that it was she who needed to be taken care of, the thought of being a burden was too much to bear. She was simply too humiliated. Even though we were not intentionally struthious, I still think we should have picked up on the signs.  Taking lots of leftovers home from meetings  No longer being able to eat much at one sitting, then taking three-quarters of the meal home Factually stating specificities such as, “Oh excellent! That’ll do me for three meals” instead of moanings such as, “I can’t remember the last time I ate” The visuals of the Power to the Poor T-shirt steadily getting bigger and bigger until it swamped her newly bird-like frame.  What would have happened to Rita if she hadn’t joined the Australian Poverty Network? If M hadn’t noticed the symptoms of starvation? How many other Ritas are out there?\\n\",\n",

       "  'title': 'Could the GameStop frenzy be replicated on Australia’s stock market?',\n",
       "  'full_article': '“This is lunacy!” James Andronis, a senior specialist in the Australian Securities Investment Commission’s market conduct team, wrote in an email to a colleague at the end of January. He was referring to a mysterious 47% surge in shares of a tiny Australian copper miner in the days after the Australia Day public holiday. The sudden increase forced the company to halt trading. The cause? The company had the same code on the Australian stock exchange as the US video game store chain GameStop did on Wall Street: GME.   Related: Wall Street versus the Redditors: the GameStop goldrush – podcast   GameStop had become the focal point of a battle between retail traders on Reddit’s r/wallstreetbets forum, who were using retail investor apps such as Robinhood, and Wall Street hedge funds who were betting on stocks falling in value. At its peak, GameStop shares reached $482, before trading was restricted on the apps and shares plummeted to below $100 last month. A gamma squeeze on GameStop shares in late February and early March has pushed the price back to under $300. Although many of the market settings that allowed what was dubbed “Gamestonk” to occur cannot happen on the Australian Securities Exchange due to how it is regulated, the controversy was being closely watched in Australia by Asic staff, according to emails and chat logs obtained under freedom of information laws by Guardian Australia. In Microsoft Teams, staff were tracking the developments from 27 January (after Australia returned to work from a public holiday), following various Reddit threads explaining what was happening with GameStop stock. “This GameStop activity is unreal,” one staff member posted in Teams the following day. “Lots of retail punters will get hurt by the end but not before a number of hedge funds do first.”    A screenshot of Asic conversations on Teams about GameStop Photograph: Asic/Guardian Australia   A briefing note was prepared outlining a timeline of what had happened, and how the short squeeze had occurred. Asic blamed GameStop’s high short to float ratio (71.2m shorts against a float of 69.75m shares) and GameStop’s high proportion of insider investors resulting in only a small amount of tradable stock – only 23m shares.   An Asic briefing note on GameStop  Asic indicated that the posts on Reddit were the match that lit the fuel, causing the share price to explode. Calissa Aldridge, Asic’s senior executive for market supervision, told Guardian Australia that watching trends on social media was something Asic increasingly needed to incorporate into its regulatory work. “We use a range of different tools to monitor activity on social media,” she said. “Predominantly the focus is on scams, but we also have a focus at the moment at really looking at the changing dynamics on social media and … working to engage with some of the moderators and be more proactive in that engagement.” But many of the factors that played into the GameStop saga could not be replicated on Australia’s stock market, she said. “We do see some stocks that have quite a bit of volatility but we really don’t think we are going to see the same sort of extremes we saw in the US. “We don’t see short selling anywhere near the extremes seen in the US.” Asic has set up working groups within its organisation to monitor social trends as retail investing continues to boom during the pandemic. The number of retail investors in the ASX went up during Covid, from 10% of the market to 18% by turnover value.   Related: Are share-trading apps a safe way to play the markets?   The regulator is concerned that investors who have jumped into trading during Covid, in markets in Australia and overseas, may not be fully informed about what they have been investing in. One concern is an increase in copy trading, where investors sign up for services that automatically copy investments made by other traders. “Activity like copy trading has been around for a while but it’s being marketed in a more targeted way and we’re seeing more uptake in copy trading,” Aldridge said. “They may not understand… what the implications are of the trade potentially going bad, and it is amplified when we look at products that are leveraged. This isn’t limited to trading in shares.” The regulator was also worried about gamification of trading apps where people are encouraged to trade more, and the apps have game-like rewards. “It’s really about enticing people to trade more than they would. There’s lots of these developments happening all at once, and you put that together with having a really significant increase in the number of new investors in the market and there’s a range of watch points there for us.” Despite the concerns, Aldridge said Asic was heartened by the number of new retail investors pouring into the market. “We see it as a positive thing there are so many new investors … the most important thing is they are really focusing on investing in a way they understand and they’re thinking about the longer term and not just trying to play the market.”\\n',\n",

       "  'full_article': \"On Wednesday Annette Kimmitt, chief executive of behemoth law firm MinterEllison, was asked to stand down from her position. Her sin was to criticise a senior parter of Australia’s largest law firm who had provided advice to attorney general Christian Porter regarding the rape allegations recently made against him. Porter firmly denies the allegations.   Related: MinterEllison confirms chief executive's departure a week after sending email on Christian Porter   Kimmitt had sent an email to all MinterEllison staff last week, apologising that no “consultation or approval processes” for the decision to assist Porter had been sought. The chief executive herself had only learned that someone from her own firm was representing Porter as a client when the attorney general gave a press conference to address the allegations. In that email to 2,000 staff, a surprised Kimmitt acknowledged that she’d personally felt “triggered” by these recent events. She extended an apology to those among the staff for whom “the nature of this matter” was similarly painful. There are 2 million survivors of sexual violence in Australia, all of whom have had to endure watching weeks of cumulative allegations made against parliamentary staffers and now against Porter. With the percentage of survivorship that size, the chief executive of such a large organisation was exercising a basic duty of care by realising that there would be staff directly or indirectly incensed, distressed or retraumatised by the sudden news that their own firm was publicly standing with Porter. Especially given a context in which the Morrison government itself has fallen short in assuring survivors or the community around them that these issues are addressed with the seriousness they demand.  “The nature of this matter is clearly causing hurt to some of you, and it has certainly triggered hurt for me. I know that for many it may be a tough day, and I want to apologise for the pain you may be experiencing,” was something that Morrison should have said to the nation when the rape allegations made by Brittany Higgins were first brought to public attention. Instead, this was the rational, reasonable and responsible response in Kimmitt’s email that preceded the loss of her job. MinterEllison’s board chairman, David O’Brien, told Kimmitt her “services were no longer required” on Tuesday. It was also reported that the MinterEllison partner now advising Porter “was thanked by the prime minister’s office” for doing so, and that he had “told his colleagues the federal government was one of their law firm’s biggest clients.” Kimmitt’s exit provokes some other recent high-level removals from institutions of traditionally conservative influence to come to mind. Former CEO of Australia Post Christine Holgate was removed from an organisation with a heavily Liberal party-dominated board after the prime minister personally drove an investigation into her conduct. An independent report that Morrison received before Christmas last year was “kept secret because not only did it completely exonerate Christine Holgate but showed that the remarks of the prime minister to the parliament were simply wrong.” One also thinks of the National party’s Bridget McKenzie, who was made to resign from her ministry for her role in the “sports rorts” affair. How curious that after adverse legal findings costing billions of dollars were made against the government for the Stuart Robert/Alan Tudge-led robodebt disaster, both retain their cabinet positions. Or that Paul Fletcher overpaid $27m on a land acquisition and is also going nowhere. What does one say about Angus Taylor’s involvement in scandals on water buybacks, critically endangered grasslands and a fake City of Sydney document beyond “Yes, he’s still a minister.” Morrison says he has not read the allegations made against Porter. He is adamant there will be no further investigation into them now that police say they have discontinued their inquiry. He has declared Porter an “innocent man”. No longer a member of Morrison’s government herself, former foreign minister Julie Bishop made the point: “I think in order to deny allegations you would need to know the substance of the allegations or at least the detail of the allegations.”   Related: Linda Reynolds extends sick leave amid ongoing controversy over Brittany Higgins   Meanwhile, some Coalition MPs speaking on the condition of anonymity have complained to journalists that Morrison’s embattled defence minister Linda Reynolds “is bearing the brunt of the criticism over the handling of Ms Higgins’ case” although “other ministers and key government figures also knew about the rape allegations before the prime minister was told.” Who, precisely, let it slip to the media that Reynolds had called Higgins a “lying cow”? This is not to say the likes of Reynolds and McKenzie should not face consequences for their sins. It’s just that there are rather a lot of sins going round, and yet consequences remain in uneven supply. If only there was something we could find that Kimmitt, Holgate, McKenzie, Reynolds and Bishop had in common that Morrison, Tudge, Porter, Robert, Fletcher and Taylor do not. I mean, apart from the fact they’ve all been thrown under the bus once scandal has beset the men around them. The highest offices of the law, corporate Australia or even the parliament have offered none of them the insulation afforded others. One can measure the proximity of a prominent woman to the federal Liberal boys’ club by the depth of the bus-tyre tracks that get left in her face.\\n\",\n",

       "  'full_article': 'Faith, family, and a little bit of farming. The Pacific’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic has been one of self-reliance and resistance: to turn to its communities and churches, its lands and seas. The region has escaped – so far – the very worst of the health ravages of the Covid-19 pandemic. A handful of islands remain defiantly coronavirus-free, though that number dwindles almost weekly now. But even without high rates of infections from the virus, the impact of the pandemic has been widespread, and profound.   Related: Papua New Guinea forced to wait for vaccines as coronavirus crisis spirals out of control   The enforced border closures have isolated communities, threatened food supplies, crippled businesses and devastated economies, particularly across a part of the world so dependent on tourism and exports. And the global pandemic has come on top of other disasters to hit the Pacific. At one stage in April 2020, Vanuatu was simultaneously grappling with the triple crises of Covid-19, a category-five cyclone in its northern islands and an erupting volcano in its south. A documentary from the Australian National University’s Australia Pacific Security College, told through the eyes of four Pacific video diarists, charts daily life on islands isolated by Covid-19. Pacific Lockdown: Sea of Resilience, shows the initial response to reports of the spreading virus as a microcosm of the fear which seized the world in the pandemic’s inchoate early days.    Dorothy Tekwie says there is significant fear of the coronavirus in Vanimo, in northern New Guinea island. From Pacific Lockdown: Sea of Resilience by the Australia Pacific Security College Photograph: Australia National University   “We’ve been worried about coronavirus coming over the border from Indonesia,” Dorothy Tekwie says from the coastal city of Vanimo, adjacent PNG’s porous border with Indonesia’s Papua province. “Once we have a case declared in Vanimo, there will be panic, a lot of people will just flee to the bush, a lot of people will be hungry, will starve, because they are not prepared.” As the virus becomes better understood, and its consequences apparent, there is a settling realisation across the Pacific correspondents that the world, and their worlds, will not return to normal for some time, perhaps ever. The pandemic has restructured families, with people returning from cities to their ancestral homes, and it has rekindled traditional ways of life, including farming, with new gardens planted to grow food.    Many in Pacific islands have turned to farming and fishing to cope with shuttered economies forced by the Covid-19 lockdowns. From Pacific Lockdown: Sea of Resilience by the Australia Pacific Security College. Photograph: Australia National University   The impact of Covid-19 on mental health across the Pacific has been profound. “I just can’t wait for the world to get back to normal,” Leo Pugram, from the island of Yap says, staring into the camera. “I just can’t wait, because I know I’m not the only one getting depressed, I’m not the only one thinking about suicide. So the faster we can get back to normal, maybe the more lives we can save also.” But there is faith too. “We are going to do our part and pray that God protects us from the Covid-19 for as long as possible,” university lecturer Brian Alofaituli says from Apia. There are setbacks and frustrations. Some trivial – a birthday celebrated alone because of curfew, a favourite restaurant shuttered – some catastrophic, even fatal – a friend and mentor whose planned cancer treatment overseas had to be abandoned because of border closures. And there is historical parallel too, a reminder of the acute vulnerability of Pacific states.    Leo Pugram is one of four video diarists in Pacific Lockdown: Sea of Resilience by the Australia Pacific Security College, released in March 2021 Photograph: ANU   In November 1918, the supply ship Talune, which had sailed from New Zealand, was inexplicably allowed to dock in the Samoan capital of Apia, despite the captain’s declaration there were sailors on board carrying the Spanish flu which was wreaking havoc across the world. No quarantine requirements were enforced. Within a month, up to 10,000 people were dead: a quarter of the island’s population. Infected bodies were left on the roadside, buried anonymously in a harbour-side mass grave. The documentary also highlights the inconsistencies in the region’s response to the modern pandemic. The ANU’s Dr Henry Ivarature points out that the Pacific countries with the highest rates of Covid-19 infections are colonies, unable to exercise sovereign control over their own borders: French Polynesia, which went from 62 infections to more than 20,000 after its borders were opened to tourists last August, and American territory Guam, where the arrival of a US navy aircraft carrier seeded the virus on the island. Also badly affected has been the contested Indonesian province of Papua, suffering the highest infection rate in Melanesia. “The geo-political consequences of the pandemic in the Pacific remains to be seen,” Ivarature says, “but if you look at the trends … Covid infections are very high in countries that do not have control over their own borders.”    In countries such as the Federated States of Micronesia, which remained free of confirmed Covid cases, significant social and cultural events were allowed to resume after periods of lockdown. Here a child’s first birthday is celebrated. From Pacific Lockdown: Sea of Resilience by the Australia Pacific Securit College from the ANNU, released March 2021.

Palau has fully vaccinated more than 20% of its population with two doses. But Papua New Guinea, where uncontrolled community transmission threatens to overwhelm the country’s fragile health system, there has not been a single vaccine administered, and the first doses won’t arrive in the country until next month.   Related: Vanuatu coronavirus vaccine rollout to take until end of 2023   From Vanimo, Dorothy Tekwie argues Covid-19 could be the catalyst for a profound shift in the way people live, across the Pacific and beyond, a shift towards self-sufficiency and simplicity. “Should we be … going back on to the land? Is it a point in time in our world history where we should take back our Melanesian culture, we should look at our heritage, our land? Right now is the turning point for every country in the world. Go back to … sit on your land.” A return, perhaps, to faith, family, and a little bit of farming.

       "  'title': 'Western Australia election: voters expected to inflict steep losses on Liberals',\n",
       "  'full_article': \"Mark McGowan is expected to be returned as premier of Western Australia with an increased majority on Saturday night, in an unsurprising result following a surprising campaign in which attention has been focused on the dwindling fortunes of the Liberal party. Twelve months ago the McGowan government would have expected to win a second term handily at the cost of a few seats. Instead, with a forecast swing of up to 12.5% to Labor, the government is expected to pick up seats and reduce the Liberal party’s numbers in the lower house to low single digits. Liberal leader Zak Kirkup is likely to lose his seat of Dawesville. Polling conducted for the West Australian newspaper showed Labor candidate Lisa Munday sitting on 55% of the primary vote – a 10.7% swing toward Labor.   Related: Total wipeout or just a landslide: how bad will the 2021 WA election be for the Liberals?   The polling was conducted early this week before Kirkup on Thursday announced his intention to quit politics if he lost his seat, and held a disastrous press conference on his party’s costings. The 34-year-old pinned much of his campaign as opposition leader on his lifelong ambition to be in politics – an ambition which could be over by 6pm. He would be the first WA Liberal leader to lose his seat in 88 years. The Liberal party has held Dawesville since it was created in 1994. As of Friday, 653,457 votes – 499,226 pre-poll and 154,231 postal – had already been cast. That’s 38% of total votes, the highest number of pre-poll votes in WA history. Despite a Labor win being clear for months before the writs were issued, much of the campaign has focused on Kirkup and internal issues within the Liberal party. “It has been pretty astonishing,” says Prof John Phillimore, the executive director of the John Curtin Institute of Public Policy. “For an election that’s been a foregone conclusion for a long time, it’s been a pretty interesting campaign but probably not in the ways that people would expect. “It has largely revolved around the Liberal party, which is interesting because it’s a pretty weak opposition. The government has just had to stand back and say ‘we stand on our record’, and watch the Liberal party explode.” Kirkup’s strategy to concede the election with three weeks to go appears to have backfired, Phillimore said. Any discussion of policy was then halted, “because the only policy is: don’t let them win by too much”. Even that modest ambition may be unattainable: if polling holds true, the Liberal party stands to lose between five and 10 seats. If the swing predicted in Kirkup’s seat is replicated statewide, the party could be reduced to just three seats, but Phillimore says it’s likely some of the biggest swings would be in existing Labor seats, allowing the Liberal party to retain at least five. If the worst predictions come true for the Liberal party it could leave the National party as the senior coalition partner in WA, a never-before-seen phenomenon. The Nationals leader, Mia Davies, has been a stable figure for the past four years, during which time the Liberals have had three leaders. “The one thing Zak Kirkup’s strategy has done is that it’s lowered expectations so much that anything above eight [seats retained in the Legislative Assembly] will be thought of as not that bad,” Phillimore said.   Related: WA election: Zak Kirkup hopes to save at least one piece of the Libs' furniture – his seat   The strategy of conceding early depended on the Liberal party being able to flip the torch and hold the government to account. Instead, moves like a renewable energy policy which appeared to take some conservative members of the Liberal party by surprise, and Kirkup announcing he would quit politics if he lost, “made it all about him”, Phillimore said. “If the point was to keep the government honest and hold the government to account, then don’t talk about yourself,” he said. The downside for the public has been that the immensely popular McGowan government, which is set to increase its already significant majority in the lower house, has not faced the level of scrutiny it may otherwise have received. The one misstep was McGowan’s suggestion the border checkpoints could stay up to keep methamphetamine out of the state. He swiftly backtracked, saying that what he actually meant was that airport checks used during the pandemic could be extended to check for drug importation, without requiring the tracking of travellers. The blunder does not appear to have dented the Labor vote. Polls close at 6pm WA time.\\n\",\n",

       "  'title': \"Guardian Australia's book club: join Rick Morton to talk about men, vulnerability and complex PTSD\",\n",
       "  'full_article': \"There are any number of words and expressions in the public sphere that become overused to the point of parody. After that “unprecedented year”, as we inch our way back to “the new normal” still observing “an abundance of caution”, one of my prime candidates is anyone who refers to a book or work of art as “eerily prescient” or “timely”. Good books are always timely: great writers reflect the world back to us, asking questions of what they encounter and applying their powers of observation and empathy to making sense of the world around us. But Rick Morton’s new book, My Year of Living Vulnerably, feels both timely and, in its unassuming way, eerily prescient of the current moment.   Related: ‘Put down our chisels and pick up our watering cans’: how to raise girls in a challenging world   This is a book about the nature of trauma, about the ways in which it lives in our bodies, shapes our lives and our understanding of and response to the world. It is a book about the nature of human contact, about how we need one another in complex, raw, consuming ways. And, as will come as no surprise to fans of Morton’s electrifying, moving debut, One Hundred Years of Dirt, it is a book steeped in a kind of candour and unabashed openness that is all too rare, inviting generosity, self-scrutiny and vulnerability of its readers. There is little need to canvass the news of the day to find examples of how such a book – such an approach – is both necessary and important, and we couldn’t be more excited to welcome Rick as the guest of this month’s Guardian Australia book club, next Friday 19 March at 1pm. Morton’s journalism has marked him out as a writer of rare compassion and forensic curiosity, and across his memoirs he’s applied that to questions of his own capacity and incapacity, and his 2019 diagnosis of complex post-traumatic stress disorder. The emotional abuse and absence of his father – so vividly recounted in One Hundred Years of Dirt – could not just be understood as a story of the failings of the past; it was a defining reality of Morton’s adult life and one that required him to explore the nature of love and being loved, and the ways in which he needed to reassess his relationship with the world. For all it has stripped things away, causing loss and devastation and instability, Covid has given us an unprecedented (sorry) opportunity to think about how we live our lives. The books we read offer us insight into different ways of thinking, invite us to ask questions of ourselves and others. Part scientific enquiry, part social research, part memoir, My Year of Living Vulnerably is a book that speaks directly to the choices we might make after a period of physical, social, even cultural distancing from which we’re only just slowly beginning to emerge.  Morton’s “big nerd project”, as he puts it, canvasses questions of forgiveness and loneliness, masculinity and kindness, touch and doubt, and while intensely personal still gives us a jumping off point for what promises to be a wonderful chat next week.   Related: Helen Garner: 'Feminism came like a bombshell into my life'   Our March book club is your chance to ask about what lessons were learnt in the writing of this book; about how a quest for love withheld has offered its author a new way to relate to the people around him; about his once again indelible depiction of his mum, Deb. It’s also your chance to offer your own prescriptions for rethinking the Self, the importance of others, and how we are to live. The acknowledgements section at the back of My Year of Living Vulnerably (as Morton puts it, a glimpse into the “emotional hinterland of the author”) includes the word love or one of its derivations at least once a paragraph. It’s a testament to the vulnerability that he has exposed himself to, and demanded of himself. So join us for a conversation for which nothing less than emotional honesty and unequivocal self-scrutiny will suffice. • Rick Morton will join Guardian Australia’s book club at 1pm on Friday 19 March, in partnership with Australia at Home.

       "  'title': 'More female executives quit Victoria’s corruption watchdog amid workplace bullying concerns',\n",
       "  'full_article': \" Senior women have continued to leave Victoria’s anti-corruption commission this year as the agency grapples with a culture of sexual harassment and bullying. The Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission’s executive director of legal services, the director of communications and the director of governance and risk have all left the commission – the latest in a string of departures over the past year. The departures mean that the four women who made up half of Ibac’s executive in 2019 have since left. Guardian Australia revealed in December that an Ibac internal staff survey showed more than half of respondents did not feel psychosocially safe at work, with 14% experiencing bullying, 11% discrimination, 13% sexual harassment and 7% occupational violence in the past year.   Related: Victoria police officer dismissed for sexual harassment reinstated   Results from the latest People Matter survey were provided to staff in January. The survey, which was completed in October, showed that figures regarding sexual harassment and bullying were steady, despite staff spending much of the time since the previous survey working from home, and efforts from management to improve the culture. Since that time, three more senior women and other female staff have left the agency or tendered their resignations. Veronica McGowan, the head of communications, left after Megan O’Halloran, a former work colleague of Ibac’s chief executive, Marlo Baragwanath, was appointed into a newly created senior communications role. The new role would have relegated McGowan, who had been at the agency since 2016, to a less senior position. Baragwanath is understood to have declared a conflict of interest in relation to the appointment of O’Halloran, who she worked with at WorkSafe, and not played any part in her recruitment as director of communication and engagement. Baragwanath said the role was subject to an open merit-based recruitment process in full compliance with public sector requirements. Baragwanath, who has been in the role since January last year, said it was inevitable staff would leave the relatively small authority, which has been operating for the past eight years, and that the departures provided opportunities for renewal. She would not comment on the reasons why so many senior women were leaving the commission. Baragwanath also did not address concerns raised by some Ibac staff to Guardian Australia that the culture of the workplace was so dire that, in some instances, it could foster corruption by discouraging people from speaking out. “Strengthening our organisational culture so that staff feel supported and empowered to do their best remains an ongoing priority for me and the broader leadership team at Ibac,” Baragwanath told Guardian Australia in a statement. “Over the last 12 months we implemented a range of internal programs with a clear focus on wellbeing, appropriate behaviours and health and safety. Our most recent People Matter Survey, which provides a snapshot of staff sentiment in October last year, shows our efforts led to more staff feeling better supported in these areas. “However, in part due to the impact of Covid-19 and remote working, we did not achieve all we set out to do. I have spoken openly with staff to acknowledge this.” It is understood that despite the internal survey results, few formal complaints have been made about sexual harassment and bullying. “Over the coming 12 months we will continue to focus on improving staff engagement and wellbeing, and on how our leaders can better support their teams and provide clearer strategy and direction,” Baragwanath said.   Related: Barrister on Four Corners' Christian Porter episode loses Victorian Bar Council seat   “As CEO I remain committed to openly address any workplace issues, and recognise that improvements require a long-term commitment and investment in our people.” The ongoing concerns about the commission’s culture comes as the Andrews government dismisses claims it has underfunded its integrity agencies. Ibac and the Victorian ombudsman both called for greater funding last year. Baragwanath, Ibac commissioner Robert Redlich QC and Glenn Ockerby, Ibac’s director of corporate services, along with senior staff from the ombudsman’s office, will front the Victorian parliament’s integrity and oversight committee on Monday. Committee chair and Labor MP Steve McGhie said: “The committee will be reviewing the performance of the agencies in handling complaints, undertaking investigations and reviews and equipping the Victorian public sector to function more effectively in an increasingly challenging environment.”\\n\",\n",

       "  'title': \"My Name Is Gulpilil review – sublime, humane, elegant traversal of Indigenous actor's life in film\",\n",
       "  'full_article': 'People in the entertainment industry sometimes speak about performers having the “it” factor – a difficult to define quality not necessarily apparent in real life, but ushered into shimmering existence on stage or screen. Nobody in the world has ever had “it” quite like the great Yolŋu actor David Gulpilil, a titanic force in Australian cinema and now the subject of director Molly Reynolds’ superb, sad, yet in its own way wonder-filled documentary, which achieves the intimidating task of doing justice to the life and career of this extraordinary artist.  Reynolds understands that Gulpilil isn’t just a great actor but a portal to a different way of thinking, a different way of being, even a different state of consciousness. If you think that sounds like hyperbole, you have not seen a David Gulpilil movie.   Related: Firestarter: The Story of Bangarra review – an engrossing celebration of artistic creation   Plenty are sampled in My Name Is Gulpilil, which oscillates between present and past, drawing on portrayals plucked from the actor’s rich oeuvre to illustrate different parts of his life and character – his story, this time, not someone else’s. Moments from his films (so smoothly integrated by editor Tania M. Nehme) feature like personal footprints, snapshots of a life impressed on to celluloid. The film plays out in the spirit of a living wake, celebrating its subject while contemplating the inevitable. One Buñuelian shot captures the actor from above, lying with his eyes closed in a coffin with red lining, his body covered in old film reels. They flow out of it, as if they are a natural part of the man himself. In a sense, of course, they are. Gulpilil has been present on our screens for a full half century, his career beginning with a breakthrough performance in Nicolas Roeg’s great 1971 film Walkabout. Back then Gulpilil was a teenager with a cheeky gleam in his eyes – now, in his 60s with lung cancer, his spirit and humour are still apparent but those eyes have dimmed. Living in Murray Bridge, South Australia with his carer Mary, who he says will be “with me until I’m gone”, we see Gulpilil take pills – including for pain management and anxiety – and puff on an inhaler. Throughout the course of the running time he philosophises on differences in attitudes towards medicine in white and Indigenous cultures, the former involving its determination to “win” – to “beat” or “conquer” illness. But Gulpilil is under no illusions about his own situation, declaring he is going “back to country on a one-way ticket”.    Molly Reynolds’ film This Is Gulpilil plays out in the spirit of a living wake, celebrating its subject while contemplating the inevitable. Photograph: Bonnie Paku   He introduces the film as “my story of my story”, implying dual layers: his life and his life in film. There have been other nonfiction productions about or involving the actor, including Bill Leimbach’s 48-minute documentary Walkabout to Hollywood, from 1980, which contains interesting footage revealing Gulpilil’s intellect and personality as a (much younger) artist. And another directed by Reynolds – 2015’s excellent Another Country, an essay-like analysis of Gulpilil’s then home town of Ramingining in the Northern Territory, which uses the location as a case study to explore incompatible aspects of white and Indigenous Australian cultures. But My Name Is Gulpilil is on another level: so sublimely made, so humane, so elegant in construction. Among other things, it is a reflection on mortality and an acknowledgment of the movie medium as a form of mausoleum, fossilising (though the great director Andrei Tarkovsky preferred to call this “sculpting”) moments in time, and here, bringing them back, for a story of a story. Several moments show Gulpilil walking towards the camera, or walking away. Sometimes he does this in the same shot. Always these moments crystallise a subtextual message about looking forward and looking backwards. The director does so without turning a blind eye to her subject’s shortcomings; in one scene Gulpilil stands alone in a hospital or medical centre corridor, as we hear audio snippets from news bulletins reporting on controversies and criminal charges he faced over years – like grim memories tumbling around his psyche.   Related: High Ground review – Simon Baker narrowly escapes white saviour tropes in colonial Australia   Seeing present-day Gulpilil on a boat evokes memories of films that position him close to water, geographically and spiritually. Among them, the creature feature Dark Age, about the pursuit of a “dreaming croc”, Peter Weir’s end-times drama The Last Wave, the final moments of Goldstone, which present Gulpilil as a kind of whispered memory in the mind of Aaron Pedersen, and those sublime coastal scenes from the original Storm Boy. Elsewhere in the documentary, in a personal reflection from the man himself, we learn that “Gulpilil” means “Kingfisher”. And so, all those scenes next to water retrospectively acquire an almost cosmic sense of purpose, as if positioning the great actor near creeks, rivers, oceans was preordained. Pensive and piercingly emotional, this is an unforgettable film.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': \"Australia's voluntary and state-based schemes are failing to enforce plastic targets\",\n",
       "  'full_article': \"Australia is likely to miss all of its own targets to rid the environment of plastic unless there is a major overhaul of its management and enforcement, conservationists and waste industry representatives say. A government review found no state or territory had investigated or penalised a company over their performance on packaging waste in the past four years. WWF-Australia said it showed the federal government’s chosen approach of voluntary schemes and state-based measures was failing.   Related: Polystyrene to be phased out next year under Australia's plastic waste plan   And the Waste Management and Resource Recovery Association of Australia, a leading industry body, has written to the federal environment minister, Sussan Ley, warning the government is likely to miss its packaging targets unless there are significant reforms. The government last week launched a national plastics plan that repeats a promise that all packaging used in Australia will be either reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025. Under the government’s approach, companies that produce and use packaging and have an annual turnover greater than $5m have two options. They can sign up to the Australian Packaging Covenant or choose to be regulated by states and territories under national laws introduced in 2011. But an independent review of the 2011 law, commissioned by the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment and published last month, found there were no reported compliance actions, investigations or complaints from states and territories in four years. “This does not indicate an absence of non-compliance from liable brand owners, but an absence of compliance and enforcement action by states and territories,” the review said. The Australian Packaging Covenant Organisation (APCO) has more than 1,500 members, including major supermarkets and some of the world’s biggest food and drinks brands, such as Nestle and Coca-Cola Amatil. The organisation told the review it had sent a list of 1,919 “potentially liable non-signatories” to its covenant to states and territories. A further 98 brands have also withdrawn from the covenant, either because of “non-compliance” or they had “elected to withdraw from the covenant and report directly to state jurisdictions”.   Related: Australia at risk of losing billions of dollars in revenue without cultural shift to re-use   In a submission to a review of the laws, which closed on Friday, WWF-Australia said the states’ and territories’ failure to enforce the law had resulted in “a system characterised by free-riders, where brands can choose to voluntarily meet APCO targets or be governed by regulations that aren’t enforced”. The organisation’s plastics campaigner, Katinka Day, said there needed to be penalties for companies that were not part of APCO. “We cannot feel confident that Australia’s packaging targets will be met unless they are made mandatory to all companies putting packaging on the market,” she said. A submission by the Waste Management and Resource Recovery Association of Australia (WMRR), representing 2,000 members including some state and local governments, said the review came at a “pivotal point” in Australia’s journey towards a circular economy. It said work to date had not been successful and was likely to fail to achieve packaging and waste targets if allowed to continue on in its current form. A “paradigm shift” was needed for the entire packaging supply chain. The chief executive of the association, Gayle Sloan, said the review could be an opportunity to overhaul the whole system “if there is the will”. “It’s very clear that business-as-usual when it comes to packaging won’t work,” she said. APCO’s chief executive, Brooke Donnelly, said the overarching objective was to drive a change “in the behaviour of various participants to achieve a positive environmental outcome”. She said there were always “non-compliant stakeholders” in any line of work, and supported steps that would raise consumer awareness and pressure on industry and government, and create industry guidelines and incentive schemes. “The reality is there are always non-compliant stakeholders in any program of work,” she said. But she said regulatory interventions were a “particularly heavy-handed approach” and change could be achieved through industry and government collaboration. The assistant federal minister for waste reduction and environmental management, Trevor Evans, said the government was reviewing whether the laws and covenant were “achieving the environmental protection goals set out within them”. “The terms of reference for the review include consideration of compliance and the issue of free-riders,” he said. Evans said any companies kicked out of the covenant for non-compliance would be assessed for “potential liability” under state and territory regulations and policies.\\n\",\n",

       "  'title': 'Morrison’s empathy gap: time to stop the damage control and start showing basic humanity | Katharine Murphy',\n",
       "  'full_article': \"For a government in damage control mode, this will be a weekend of waiting. Waiting for parliament to resume, waiting for the Newspoll to drop. Opinion polls out early next week will provide the first public read on any political damage inflicted by the Brittany Higgins allegation and the historical allegation of rape against the attorney general, Christian Porter, which he denies. Waiting isn’t new. Scott Morrison has been waiting for weeks – waiting to see if he can wait out the furore, waiting to see if the terrible wound that has opened in the parliamentary precinct (and beyond) during the past month will close over. Right in front of us, Australia’s prime minister is waiting, and calculating.   Related: AFP didn't pass on documents detailing allegation against Christian Porter to NSW police   The prime minister hasn’t taken me into his confidence about his various calculations, but having watched how he operates, I reckon I can have a stab at some of them. Before deciding, once and for all, whether Porter can remain as attorney general, and Linda Reynolds as defence minister, Morrison wants to assess the salience of federal parliament’s #MeToo moment. Have voters logged the Higgins story, and the rape allegation levelled by a now-deceased woman against his attorney general? Do they have views about it? What are the views? Do men feel differently about these stories than women? Do women feel differently depending on their life experiences? Do privileged women feel differently about these stories than less privileged women? Can any of these differences help the government navigate the biggest political crisis they’ve faced since the bushfires? Morrison thinks like a campaign director, and the mindset of the campaign director is simple: how can we swim across this rip? While Morrison has waited, he’s engaged in mild weaponisation of the Porter issue by declaring the rule of law will crumble if the attorney general has to submit to a process to determine his fitness to remain in the cabinet. Morrison has framed this argument as a heroic point of principle. But the prime minister’s argument is nonsense. It is absolute bollocks. Justin Gleeson, the former solicitor general, completely demolished Morrison’s “rule of law” defence this week as only a dedicated servant of the rule of law can. Read his piece if you haven’t. In between bouts of mild weaponisation (I say mild, because if Morrison elects to really dig in, this will get much worse), we’ve had flooding the zone – vaccine announcements that spun off in multiple directions. Half-price tickets to delightful tourist destinations in marginal seats complete with Morrison grinning for the cameras in a pilot’s cap. Vaccinations are of course important. So is the economic recovery post-Covid. But given the gravity of the issues Morrison was fully intent on waiting out – given the fury and grief that had erupted around the country in the past few weeks – a prime minister grinning in a pilot’s cap like he was fronting a Flight Centre advertisement felt like we’d washed up in a political grotesquerie. The performance art read like an “up yours” that no one had asked for. It felt about as sonorous as nails dragging down a chalkboard. Right now, Morrison is projecting a significant empathy gap, and that is dangerous.  At no point has Morrison responded to these issues like a human being, or like an inclusive leader. He’s responded like a politician in damage control. Calculation and calibration are no substitutes for empathy, and basic humanity. No doubt, voter views about these allegations are not homogenous. I’m sure there will be a gender gap in the private polling being undertaken by the major parties, and I’m sure women will see these stories slightly differently depending on their life experiences.   Related: News Corp Australia papers labelled 'sexist' and 'toxic' by former staff photographer at media inquiry    But I’m also reasonably confident that projecting like a prime minister who doesn’t get it, who isn’t listening, who is intent on ensuring there remains one rule for the political class and another rule for the rest of the country, isn’t a sound strategy. If one of the Liberal party’s key swing constituencies is women over 35, who are hard to reachand necessary for electoral success, then looking empathic is pretty important. If you look like you don’t care about Brittany Higgins, or you don’t care about a rape allegation against your attorney general, then you prompt voters to ask: does this guy care about me? Does this bloke fathom the challenges I face in my life, or is he just another grasping political careerist? These are universal questions, whether you work part-time at Bunnings, or whether you are a partner in a law firm, and these are questions prime ministers don’t want voters asking about them. If voters continue to ask these questions, if Labor gets some traction around probity and accountability in the parliament, if the question, “what have you got to do to lose your job in this government?” gets some currency, then Morrison, for all the current stonewalling, could turn on the head of a dime. Some people around the prime minister are already asking a simple question: is Porter really worth this pain? My question isn’t about the prime minister’s pain threshold. It’s about the custodial responsibilities any prime minister should be prepared to exercise in office. My question is much the same as Gleeson’s (although I’m much less erudite). Gleeson framed his question to Morrison this way: “Is the standard you set that you permit Porter to remain in the high office of attorney general with serious allegations of this kind hanging over him, when you have chosen not to have those allegations tested in a fair, independent inquiry that is available to you? If so, why?” Why indeed. As well as the return of question time (minus Porter and minus Reynolds, and with Peter Dutton running tactics in the House) on Monday, women who really want things to be different, who are sick of the endless indignities and the weasel words and the bollocks, will march around the country. I hope Morrison can find the will and the wisdom to listen.\\n\",\n",

       "  'full_article': 'Liberty Steel, the UK’s third largest steel maker, will pause some production at its UK plants on Monday as workers prepare to be furloughed for as long as a month while the business tries to conserve cash. About 180 workers at Liberty’s plant in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, were put on furlough on Friday evening under the government’s coronavirus support scheme. Some of the site’s 660 staff have been told they may not be able to return to work until 14 April as the company tries to reduce its cash outflows. A spokesman for Liberty’s parent company, GFG Alliance, confirmed that some parts of the business would be “operating intermittently”. This can be achieved “without compromising the condition of the plant”, it said in a statement. Sanjeev Gupta, Liberty’s owner, has told the heads of companies in his steel and industrial empire to keep cash in the business and “reduce their call on group resources”, as he tries to reach an agreement over debts owed to a collapsed lender. Gupta’s GFG Alliance, which employs a global workforce of 35,000, was put under severe pressure this week after its key lender, Greensill Capital, collapsed into administration on Monday. GFG is scrambling to find new lenders to prop up its businesses, which employ 5,000 people in the UK. Of these, 3,000 work at Liberty Steel, while GFG also runs Britain’s last aluminium smelter, in Scotland, as well as an energy supply business. The company has significant operations in Australia and across Europe. Gupta said on Friday that he had received various offers to refinance, but that he needed time to reach a deal with Greensill’s adminstrators. Unions are hopeful that financing will be secured and believe the steel business can be profitable. Gupta began to build up the business in the 1990s by acquiring otherwise unloved steel assets in the hope of creating an industrial powerhouse. Lawyers for Greensill this week told a London court that it had lent $5bn (£3.6bn) to GFG to help fund the businesses, according to the Financial Times. In a letter sent on Friday to GFG’s senior leadership and seen by the Guardian, Gupta said GFG had had “constructive discussions” with Greensill’s administrators. He said GFG hoped for a “formal standstill agreement that would put on hold arrangements between the two parties and allow both sides more time to assess and negotiate next steps”. This week, GFG hired investment bankers from PJT Partners, the restructuring advisers Alvarez & Marsal and the law firm Norton Rose Fulbright to help in negotiations with the administrators. They are also advising on negotiations with an undisclosed number of potential lenders to inject more cash to the business. Gupta said he was “enthused by the amount of offers that we have received” but added that “given the scale of our operations this process will take some time to organise”. Talks to secure longer-term financing could take several months to complete, said one source with knowledge of the situation. The timing of GFG’s cash needs have not been disclosed, and it is thought that detailed knowledge of the Greensill loans is limited to a tight-knit circle around Gupta. Gupta told the heads of GFG’s businesses that they should “take prudent steps to manage their cash positions carefully and reduce their call on group resources”. His message also sought to portray the group as “performing well”, but with “specific businesses … affected by either Covid-19, structural changes in their markets, or pressures on cash related to a rapid ramp up in demand.” The UK business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, has discussed the situation with executives at Liberty Steel, but the company is seeking private-sector funding. Unions representing the steel workers want the government to give assurances that it will step in to save production if a funding deal falls through. France’s finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, said this week that his government would step in to protect jobs at GFG’s French sites.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'Boris Johnson could clash with backbenchers over coalmine',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Boris Johnson is on a potential collision course with backbench MPs and local Conservative leaders amid a furious Tory response to the decision to put a hold on plans to create a controversial new coalmine in Cumbria. While environmental groups hailed the decision to call in the application for government consideration as long overdue, and Labour called for a longer-term plan for green jobs in the region, many Tories are dismayed at the uncertainty over a scheme its supporters say would create 500 jobs and support 2,000 more in supply chains.   Related: Cumbria mine: what will the public inquiry look at?   Mark Jenkinson, the MP for Workington in Cumbria – one of many traditionally Labour seats to change hands in the 2019 general election – said anger over the planned mine near Whitehaven “cannot be understated”. “This represents a complete reversal of the position taken just eight weeks ago, and a capitulation to climate alarmists,” he said in a statement. Mike Starkie, the Conservative mayor of Copeland in Cumbria, said proper focus had not been placed on the fact that the mine was intended to produce coking coal for use in the steel industry. “We’re going to need steel to drive forward the green agenda – if you’re wanting to build windfarms, nuclear power stations, they all need steel,” he told the BBC. “And the demand for coking coal is going to be there right through to 2050.” In contrast, environmental groups said the decision by the communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, to take responsibility for the scheme away from the local authority was obvious, particularly ahead of Glasgow hosting the pivotal Cop26 climate conference in November.    An artist’s impression of the proposed deep coalmine in west Cumbria near Whitehaven Photograph: West Cumbria Mining Company   A new coalmine in Cumbria would “destroy the UK government’s credibility” ahead of the summit, Friends of the Earth climate campaigner Tony Bosworth said. International pressure on the government over the mine was ratcheted up earlier this week when John Kerry, the former US secretary of state who is now the county’s climate change envoy, used a visit to London to praise the UK for phasing out coal use. Officials were refusing to say why Jenrick intervened, having declined to do so before, citing the fact that the calling of the planning application is a quasi-judicial process. A communities department source said Jenrick’s decision was based largely on the need to consider new recommendations from the climate change committee, which advises the UK government, and on the fact that Cumbria county council had been unable to reach a clear decision about the project.   Related: Green jobs in Cumbria could far surpass posts in coalmine, report says   There will now be an inquiry led by the Planning Inspectorate, with Cumbria county council asked to provide information on how the mine would be consistent with “meeting the challenge of climate change, flooding and coastal change”. The political ramifications remain fraught for Johnson, not least because the local MP for the proposed mine, Trudy Harrison, is his parliamentary private secretary, a role in which MPs act as an unpaid aide and backbench liaison lead for ministers. The Northern Research Group (NRG), a powerful lobby of about 50 backbench Tories, has not yet spoken out about Jenrick’s decision, but is a strong supporter of the mine. In February, dozens of NRG MPs, alongside local Tories, condemned Labour’s opposition to the plan. Labour’s shadow business secretary, Ed Miliband, argued on Friday that the mine would not create secure jobs and that the government was “peddling false solutions” for the steel industry. Instead, he said, ministers should invest in efforts to help the steel industry decarbonise, delivering long-term jobs. The sentiment was not shared throughout Labour. Emma Williamson, a Labour councillor for Kells and Sandwith in Whitehaven, said she was “absolutely gutted” at the decision and what it would mean for jobs and investment. “I’m really concerned that this is the end of the road for the mine,” she said. “I’m concerned because my community needs these jobs and these investments, especially after the year we have had around Covid.” Williamson said her community was fully behind the mine, not just for the prospect for investments and training, but also the sense of community it may bring, and the opportunities for young people. She said: “I work really closely with a local group of ex-miners, and they’ve often relayed such fond memories of the camaraderie that the mine brought to our community. It didn’t just bring jobs and investment, but it also brought family together and community spirit. That’s why we’re so supportive of this, and we really need this lift.” But Marianne Birkby, founder of Radiation Free Lakeland, which opposes the mine in part because of its proximity to the Sellafield nuclear waste site, said Jenrick’s decision was “fantastic news”. “Arguably the greater and far more visceral threat from this mine is that it is close to Sellafield, and the mine would be directly underneath decades of radioactive waste,” she said. Gerard Richardson, a local business owner, said that he found the decision “ridiculously frustrating”. “This is an area that badly needs investment. This was a rare piece of genuine investment in west Cumbria and it could have been a starting point for so much more. It really is truthful to say that the majority of the campaigners are from outside of London.”\\n',\n",

       "  'title': \"'I thought there'd be more mischief': schools return in England\",\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Schools in England reopened on 8 March with new regular testing and mask-wearing in classrooms. Both have been recommended by the government for secondary schools, but are not compulsory, raising concerns among some teachers and students. Two teachers and a pupil have spoken about their first week back at school.  ‘It would be better if we had blended learning’    As pupils return to primary school after weeks of online learning, they bring with them “a different kind of stress” said Louise Neve, 51, a teacher in Hampshire. This week she has been frustrated by the safety guidance for junior schools as social distancing is largely unrealistic for younger classes. Her “bubble” of 28 pupils, aged eight and nine, are provided with hand gel and the classroom windows are opened an inch or two. “Covid is now known to be airborne rather than mostly transmitted on surfaces,” said Neve. “It would be much better if we had blended learning, with smaller classes and children coming in on a rota.” Neve, who is clinically vulnerable with several health conditions including asthma, was only recently vaccinated, “so it hasn’t kicked in yet”. She is worried about catching Covid from her pupils or passing the virus on to her 16-year-old daughter, who has a chronic post-viral condition. “If I were to pick it up from one of the asymptomatic children, I could then take it home to her,” she said. “It’s not as simple as saying the children don’t get ill: there’s a bigger picture that nobody at the top level seems to be looking at.” The mood among teachers is mixed, she said. “To those who are vulnerable, it’s more of a worry because we’re in contact with larger numbers of children. But it’s a smaller workload than when teaching online.” ‘I imagined there would be more whispering with the masks on’ Joanne Humphrey, 50, head of English at a secondary school in Oxfordshire, also has “mixed feelings” about returning to the classroom. While she is glad to see her students again, she’s “exhausted” after a week of teaching through a face mask. “It’s difficult to project your voice,” she said. “I’m straining to listen to students if they put their hand up and say something. I don’t want to ask students to repeat themselves four times, because eventually they’ll give up and stop putting their hand up out of embarrassment.” To Humphrey’s surprise, however, most of her students, who are in class sizes of 15 to 24, have complied with the new rule. “Motivating and controlling the class hasn’t been as bad as I thought. I imagined there would be more mischief and whispering with the masks on. Having said that, I teach year 9s and above – so maybe that’s more of a problem with the younger students.”   Related: Allow school trips in summer term, UK outdoor education centres say   And it certainly beats online lessons, she added. “Our students have worked hard at home but the majority feel they learn better in person. Some have said they were nervous about asking questions online; they felt as though they’d look silly. They don’t feel that pressure in the classroom.” ‘It’s nearly impossible to social distance with 30 people in a class’    Imamul Ahmed, 18, a student in Birmingham, agrees that it’s better to be back in school. “Home learning was very stressful,” he said. “You can end up feeling alone, but at school the environment is completely different. There’s a sense of community you just don’t get with online teaching.” Ahmed, who is studying biology, chemistry and 3D design at A-level and is hoping to become a dentist, said he had enjoyed seeing his friends but sometimes found wearing a mask all day difficult. “They can sometimes make it hard to concentrate and by the end of the day it feels like you can’t breathe. “It’s also nearly impossible to social distance with 30 people in a class. It makes me laugh when you watch the news and they show a small group spaced out in a room – that’s not what it’s like.” Ahmed said Covid testing at his school of 1,100 pupils had gone quite well so far. Lessons were cancelled on Monday and students were asked to come in, with time slots provided for each form group of about 20 to 30 students, with six to eight booths in the hall for them to use. “I think it’s OK because we can do it ourselves,” he said. “There’s privacy to do your test but two people share a booth.” We had to provide our mobile number at the start so once you’re finished you leave the hall and your result is texted to you.” As an A-level student, Ahmed is worried about exams especially after falling behind in November when he got Covid from school. “We’re not having traditional exams but we’re still having smaller ones. I’m revising as much as I can but it’s getting a bit overwhelming,” he said.  “So many of us had wishes and thoughts for our last year but it’s all just been thrown in the bin. Teachers are trying their best with the changing guidance from the government, but morale is low.”\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'Jason Roy blasts England home in first T20 in India after Jofra Archer excels',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'A change of format brought a change of fortune for England in Ahmedabad as the excellence of Jofra Archer and an aggressive performance with the bat saw the tourists cruise to a dominant eight-wicket victory over India in their Twenty20 series opener. Gone were the demons experienced on the same ground during the recent 3-1 defeat in the Test matches, England’s batsmen knocking off their target with 27 balls to spare after Archer’s earlier three for 23 had reduced the hosts to 124 for seven.   Related: England beat India by eight wickets in first T20 international – live reaction!   For Jonny Bairstow there was a pleasing return to the scene of the three ducks in four innings that followed his much-debated mid-tour break, clubbing an unbeaten 26 from 17 balls, while Dawid Malan’s first outing on the subcontinent saw him seal the win with a handsome straight six off Washington Sundar to finish 24 not out from 20. Jason Roy had earlier broken the back of the chase with a 32-ball 49, ending what has been a personally fallow 12-month period in international cricket for the opener. This was timely too, given some recent (albeit mixed) messages from England about the in-form Alex Hales possibly ending a near two-year exile from the set-up. But as good as the batsmen were – and this was not a straightforward surface for the first of five matches at the Narendra Modi stadium – the 1-0 lead for Eoin Morgan’s players was set up by a performance in the field that belied a lack of warmup cricket for the majority, and highlighted the centrality of Archer to their T20 World Cup plans. “I’m just glad to help,” said Archer, fresh from his best figures in T20i cricket and having shown few signs of the elbow injury that affected his Test campaign. “When the competition is tough you step up – and competition brings out the best in me.” Morgan had said before the match that bowlers are still playing catch-up in T20 as the skills of batsmen continue to expand. But here, after winning the toss, his attack was clinical, wiping out India’s top three and sending down 25 dot balls in an opening powerplay of just 22 runs that left the hosts immediately up against it. This was produced through a heady mix of leg-spin and outright pace. Archer struck with his second ball as KL Rahul chopped on and Adil Rashid, the solitary spinner and entrusted with the first over, snared Virat Kohli for a fifth-ball duck as he attempted to give himself room, only to slap one to the safe hands of Chris Jordan at mid-off. The 67,000-strong crowd was stunned into silence by the departure of the Indian captain and though Rishabh Pant soon broke this with a frankly outrageous scooped six off Archer, the hush returned when Mark Wood lit up Shikhar Dhawan’s bails during the first of four fiery overs that continued Archer’s initial hostility. India were badly in need of a partnership and though Shreyas Iyer batted through from No 5 to the final over – eventually falling to a Jordan slower ball for a 48-ball 67 made through classical strokeplay and one cut six over backward point – England held a solid length on the two-paced pitch and struck at regular intervals to stymie any momentum. Key to this was the removal of the dangerous Pant in the 10th over. He may have bettered the trick shot witnessed off Jimmy Anderson during the fourth Test but the left-hander was successfully suppressed thereafter, eventually flicking the golden arm of Ben Stokes to Bairstow in the deep to see India 48 for four by the halfway stage. It left Hardik Pandya as the only recognised hitter left alongside Iyer but when Archer returned for a second spell and claimed two in two balls – Pandya chipping to mid-off for a 21-ball 19 and Shardul Thakur pulling the fast bowler to long leg – England’s batsmen knew their looming chase would likely be manageable.

It meant that when Roy eventually perished, lbw to Sundar after Buttler had been similarly trapped by leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal for 28, a mere 35 runs were required from 8.5 overs.  Out strode Bairstow bristling with intent, pumping two sixes and standing his ground when he and Sundar collided at the non-striker’s end to see a return catch off Malan go down. Like England as a whole, it was a reminder that Bairstow is a very different beast when white-ball cricket comes around.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'England need aggression with discipline, says Henry Slade',\n",
       "  'full_article': \"Henry Slade has called for controlled aggression as England seek to stay on the right side of law against France amid claims of “psychological warfare” from the opposing camp. Eddie Jones’s side are seeking to avoid a third defeat in four Six Nations matches and a first home loss to France in the championship since 2005 and are only too aware that they must improve their discipline to do so. They have shipped 41 penalties in their three matches so far and their tally of 14 against Wales last time out ultimately proved pivotal.   Related: Jalibert's French flair highlights contrast with conservative England   In an interview with the French newspaper Midi Olympique on Friday, the France centre Gaël Fickou spoke of the “psychological warfare” that surrounds this fixture, and told of how “the arrogance of the English is part of this decorum that reigns” around it. England, for their part, have kept their counsel this week when asked about the needle associated with le crunch – no doubt aware their discipline will be under the spotlight – with Jones bristling at the line of questioning and Mako Vunipola simply insisting his side will “unsettle them on the ball”. Slade meanwhile, is adamant England will continue to play on the edge but will do so legally. “We’ve still got to be on the edge, you can’t just go into your shells and play soft. You still have to be going for it and pushing the limits all the time, but just with the understanding that discipline is so key. Hopefully we’ll get on the right side of that. “I know [discipline] has been bit of a problem for us for a little while but we’ve been genuinely addressing it. I can’t speak for everyone, but I’m hoping we’re much more disciplined at the weekend. Penalties give teams massive ins into the team and pile the pressure on, so we understand that important that is. But it’s coupled with our intent to attack the game.” The irony of England’s defeat by Wales is that discipline developed into a problem they ultimately could not overcome, just as they were getting on top of their previous No 1 issue, their attacking fluency – or lack thereof. In Cardiff England produced some of their finest attacking rugby since the 2019 World Cup and the hope is that Max Malins can add to that on the full-back’s first England start. “As the tournament has progressed we’ve got better,” added Slade. “The performance against Scotland was nowhere near where we wanted to be. After that game we had a lot of honest conversations and people said what they wanted to say. We clarified a lot of things and we’ve definitely made a bit of a mindset shift. “Sometimes our first option was to kick rather than to run and we’ve definitely shifted in the right direction in terms of having a more balanced game and wanting to take people on and run. We’ve got a lot of talented individuals in this team, talented ball carriers up front, people with exciting footwork and pace out wide. “We told ourselves to get genuinely excited about the opportunities we can put ourselves in to take people on. I don’t think the scoreline against Wales reflected how the game went. We are definitely looking to go as hard as we can these next week and put a smile back on people’s faces. We want everyone to be behind us and we’re working as hard as we can for that. Hopefully we can do the job.”   The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.  Slade comes up against the returning Virimi Vakatawa, who makes his first appearance of the competition on Saturday. The pair went head-to-head in the European Champions Cup final last October, with Slade’s Exeter edging a thrilling final but Vakatawa still shining in defeat for Racing 92. “We all know he’s a dangerous runner,” added Slade. “He’s got good footwork and he’s a strong lad. Just from playing against him in the Champions Cup final, little cues about when he’s stepping and when he’s getting on the ball. You can tell from watching on the TV or on computers but until you get up close and personal, those are the things you need to be up in their face to see.”\\n\",\n",

       "  'full_article': 'From the earliest X-rays to the latest body scanners, the ability to visualise the inside of the living body has revolutionised medical diagnosis. With a profound understanding of physics, great technical ingenuity and a mission to put these skills to use in the service of medicine, John Mallard, who has died aged 94, was one of the first to establish routine scanning services that revealed tumours in organs such as the brain and the liver. His team at the University of Aberdeen built the first whole-body MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scanner and produced the first clinically significant MRI images of a hospital patient.  Mallard was interested in ends rather than means and pioneered several different forms of imaging technology, adopting another technique each time it offered the chance to produce clearer images or greater safety for the patient. In the beginning, locating tumours or other pathology involved injecting radioactive tracers and picking up their emissions with detectors outside the body. Scientists in the US developed the principle of tomography (essentially 3D imaging) in 1964, rotating detectors around the body to build an image in successive slices – a process that Mallard likened to the slivers that emerged from the bacon slicer in his father’s shop. From 1967 to 1969, he led the development of the Aberdeen Section Scanner, a machine that used this principle to detect gamma rays emitted by injected radioisotopes and produce a digital output that could guide radiotherapy in cancer treatment. In 1964 Mallard had shown that there were differences between normal and tumour tissues in intrinsic signals known as electron spin resonance, and predicted that a scanner based on that principle would be able to “see” tumours without having to inject any radioactivity. No one paid any attention to his paper in the journal Nature, but a few years later scientists in the US made the first research breakthroughs with MRI. Immediately grasping its potential, Mallard hired Jim Hutchison and Bill Edelstein to explore this new approach, which involved detecting the impact of a strong magnetic field on the hydrogen nuclei of the water molecules in living tissue. As soon as they produced their first successful image of a mouse, Mallard set about raising the funds to build a scanner that could take a human patient. Equipped with the first electromagnet produced by the then fledgling company Oxford Instruments, and using standard copper tubing and second-hand parts, the “homemade” scanner initially encountered a problem with the movement caused by heartbeats, which blurred the image. Hutchison and Edelstein solved this problem, a discovery that Mallard called “the real breakthrough” for MRI. Meanwhile the biologist on the team, Meg Foster, developed a greater understanding of the differences in MRI signals between normal and diseased tissue. In August 1980, the team’s Mark 1 scanner successfully imaged a cancer patient and revealed previously undiagnosed tumours. The Aberdeen group’s patents on refinements to MRI technology later earned millions in royalties for the university, as commercial manufacturers began to produce scanners for hospitals around the world. Mallard was born in Kingsthorpe, a suburb of Northampton. His father, also John, ran a grocer’s shop, supported by his wife, Margaret (nee Huckle). John was their only child, and from early childhood was, in his own words, “seriously handicapped by deafness”. In spite of this he won a scholarship to attend Northampton Town and County grammar school. A further borough scholarship took him to the University of Nottingham to study physics. He stayed at Nottingham for a PhD on the magnetic properties of uranium. In 1951 he began his first job, as a hospital physicist at the Liverpool Radium Institute, where he learned how to inject patients with radioactive iodine and move a Geiger counter across the neck to produce an image of the thyroid gland. In 1953 he moved to become a senior physicist and later head of department at the Royal Postgraduate Medical School, then based at Hammersmith hospital, in west London. There he built an automatic scanner to detect emissions from injected radioisotopes and print the results, a machine that could reveal brain tumours with an accuracy of 80%. At Hammersmith hospital he met Fiona Lawrance, who was working as a medical secretary, and they were married in 1958. They had two children, John and Katriona. In 1965 the family moved over 500 miles north when Mallard took up the new chair in medical physics at the University of Aberdeen – coincidentally it was Fiona’s home town. While there he campaigned to raise the funds to open a PET (positron emission tomography) facility, which eventually opened in the early 1980s. David Lurie, now professor of biomedical physics at Aberdeen, joined Mallard’s MRI group in 1983. Acknowledging the communication difficulties caused by his “old school” boss’s profound hearing loss, he says Mallard often issued directions to his staff in the form of hand-written memos. “One of his real talents was realising what would become important and putting teams together to investigate these things,” he said, adding that Mallard was fundamentally kind, and delighted when his suggestions proved fruitful. Mallard retired in 1992, when he was also made OBE. He continued to give talks and write review papers, and devoted his leisure time to gardening, music, opera and ballet, and making jewellery. Though the Aberdeen team was not recognised in the 2003 Nobel prize for the development of MRI, Mallard received numerous other honours, including the Royal Society Wellcome prize and gold medal, the Royal Medal of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and the freedoms of the city of Aberdeen and of his birthplace, Northampton. The John Mallard Scottish PET Centre, a purpose-built successor to the one he first established in the 80s, was opened in 1998. Fiona died in 2020. John is survived by their children and four grandchildren. • John Mallard, medical physicist, born 14 January 1927; died 25 February 2021\\n',\n",

       "  'title': \"The Guardian view on Johnson's coalmine: political gain at planetary cost | Editorial\",\n",
       "  'full_article': 'It must have seemed a clever Johnsonian ruse. Build a deep coalmine – the first in decades – in Labour’s historical heartland and put yourself on the side of working-class northern voters who want jobs and against environmentalists who, one could slyly suggest, prefer saving the planet than local communities. Boris Johnson thought, no doubt, with a cunning that has wrongfooted many opponents, that he could frame the argument in such terms and still meet his “net zero” targets because the vast majority of Cumbrian coal would end up for export rather than domestic use (it’s too sulphurous to be used to make steel in Britain). The result is that the greenhouse gas emissions would end up on some other nation’s books when carbon budgets were calculated. Not dissimilar to his view of cake, Mr Johnson was saying that his policy on coal is “pro having it and pro heating it”. The problem for Mr Johnson was that the Biden administration was having none of it. The US had the good sense to understand the implications if Britain was allowed to press ahead with a plan to dig out coal and send it abroad without busting its own carbon budget. If everyone took the same view, the world would be toast. The US reasons that if jobs are the issue, then use state investment in green technologies for coal-free steel. Within days of John Kerry, the US climate envoy, warning Mr Johnson that coal has no future, the government conceded it would be “calling in” the planning application for the Cumbrian mine. Importantly Mr Johnson would not be shamed into a U-turn in the run-up to the UN’s Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow in November.  The climate emergency is a real threat: the UN calculates that greenhouse gas emissions must drop by 45% in the next decade to limit global temperatures to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. Yet mini-me Mr Johnsons keep popping up in positions of power. On Friday Mathias Cormann, an Australian rightwing coal-loving politician, was announced as the new secretary general for the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Mr Cormann should not have been allowed anywhere near the job. He had labelled 2050 net zero targets as “extremist … reckless and irresponsible” and in office abolished a carbon pricing scheme that had driven cuts in emissions. That Mr Cormann was elected by consensus is an indictment of the process. It speaks to the OECD’s concern about the rise of China, which Australia has butted heads with recently – to Mr Cormann’s benefit. The OECD is where the rich world sits down to shape the global economic agenda – by getting its laggards to strive for the outcomes that its most successful members achieve. The organisation’s secretary general is a powerful figure with access to G20 leaders. The OECD has a pivotal climate role as richer nations have to decarbonise first. They are responsible for the largest atmospheric stock of carbon dioxide, and have the financial as well as technological expertise to deal with it.  Climate policy by rightwingers down under amounts to following a rabbit into the hole and hoping to emerge in Wonderland. Mr Cormann’s appointment is likely to be in exchange for Australia to announce its own net zero target for greenhouse emissions. This realpolitik exposes Conservatism as being engaged not with climate policy, but in a search for a superior moral justification for selfishness. Like Mr Johnson, Australian rightwingers pay lip service to environmental issues – Mr Cormann had the chutzpah to put climate at the heart of his job application – while peddling greenwash policies and state-shrinking economics. This kind of politics, which unfortunately dominates today, paves the road to perdition. If all the national pledges submitted to the UN so far were met, emissions would be reduced by only 1% by 2030 compared with 2010 levels. Mr Biden is talking sense when he offers a transformative fiscal and regulatory agenda to showcase the positive role of the state geared toward the creation of well-paid jobs and limiting catastrophic environmental damage. The world ought to listen.\\n',\n",

He will presumably not be as accommodating on Saturday although, on the back of a tremendous win at Anfield and six days off, Fulham should not be taken lightly.

       "  'title': 'The Guardian view on memorials for Covid-19: raw events need distance | Editorial',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'What do communities choose to remember, and what do they choose to forget? The Spanish flu killed 50-100 million people between 1918 and 1920, the most vulnerable aged between 20 and 40. The first world war killed 17 million. And yet the pandemic had almost no place in the collective memory. There are no significant memorials to it, no famous body of literature around it. Laura Spinney, in her book Pale Rider, suggests that it was because the Spanish flu was global in scale and so confined in time – most of the deaths occurred within a few months in 1918 and 1919 – that the catastrophe did not take on a similar kind of significance to the first world war. The war, too, may have seemed more translatable into tragic narrative – a self-evidently manmade disaster, as opposed to the “natural” catastrophe of disease. Though if Covid-19 has taught us anything, it is the extent to which the disease is shaped as much by politics, culture and economics as by “nature”. The Covid-19 pandemic is clearly quite different from Spanish flu. There are already calls to raise permanent memorials, including by St Paul’s Cathedral in London. This is absolutely understandable. People have put their mourning for loved ones on hold, through necessity. The normal rituals that help to channel grief – those rites, religious or otherwise, that involve the encircling, physical presence of family and friends – have been snatched away. There is a deep, human yearning for something tangible, something that people can gather around. And there is a good-hearted desire to honour those many, in different walks of life, who put themselves in danger to save, or serve, others. Yet caution is desirable. As the months roll on, and the world faces more and more bleak anniversaries, it is clear that there is much to digest about this catastrophe. Lockdowns in the UK may be easing, supposedly for the last time. But the pandemic will go on in all kinds of ways even when the intensive care units have emptied out: Britain, and much of the world, will be dealing with its own form of long Covid for years to come. There are reckonings yet to happen, too. It is clear that there has been, in the UK and in many other countries, suffering and deaths that could have been averted had better decisions been taken. Rushing to erect sculptures in stone and bronze is premature when the events are so raw. Some of the best recent memorials have been evanescent. One thinks of Jeremy Deller’s haunting We’re Here Because We’re Here, which marked the centenary of the Battle of the Somme with the appearance of silent young men, dressed as first world war soldiers, in public places. The best permanent memorials have been highly allusive and open-ended, such as Rachel Whiteread’s Holocaust memorial for Vienna, its form cast from inward-facing library shelves. For the time being, let commemorations of this pandemic be impermanent, delicate and transitory. They need be no less heartfelt, meaningful – and memorable – for that.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'Long Covid more likely in working-age women than in men – study',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Working-age women who are hospitalised with coronavirus are five times as likely to develop long Covid as men in the same age group, according to research presented to the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage). Preliminary data shared with scientific advisers suggests that women under 50 are five times as likely as men under 50 to report a new disability, six times as likely to experience greater breathlessness, and twice as likely to feel more fatigued up to 11 months after leaving hospital. The findings from the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium (Isaric) group have yet to be peer-reviewed and published in a scientific journal, but will nonetheless raise concerns over the potential impact of Covid infections on the working population as restrictions across the UK are eased. The Isaric findings build on previous evidence that women are bearing the brunt of long Covid. According to a recent study from King’s College London, women are in general twice as likely as men to have Covid symptoms last longer than a month – an effect that in some cases may be connected to differences between male and female immune systems. While more than 23 million people in the UK have now received at least one shot of vaccine, the immunisation is not 100% protective, and two-thirds of the population has yet to receive a first jab. Scientific advisers stressed that while Covid cases had come down sharply during lockdown, prevalence remained “very high” compared with rates last summer. Writing in the minutes of a Sage meeting on 25 February, the advisers stressed the importance of keeping infection rates down, particularly as it remains unclear whether vaccines offer any protection against long Covid, also known as post-Covid syndromes. The document states that the long-term impact of long Covid on the working-age population “is not well understood, but it may be very significant”. The Isaric study reports symptoms from 325 people who were hospitalised with Covid. These make up about 40% of the patients researchers approached, and may be the ones who suffered most with long-term symptoms. Half of the patients who took part were still recovering on average seven months after being discharged. Three-quarters of these had fatigue, half were more breathless than before, and about a quarter had new disabilities affecting their sight, memory, communication or ability to walk or look after themselves. One striking finding was that persistent symptoms among those discharged from hospital were not related to older age or a person having a pre-existing medical condition. “In fact, younger participants were more likely to report persistent symptoms and ongoing difficulties,” the researchers state. The Sage advisers noted that overall, the participants reported a drop in quality of life, including greater difficulty doing their usual activities and increases in anxiety, depression and pain.   Related: Long Covid: ‘It’s a year since I’ve felt like myself’   Further work is under way on long Covid, including studies on people who have not been hospitalised, and plans to bring together different studies to better understand the overall impact of the syndromes, the minutes add. “It will be important to have a better understanding of physiology, including oxygen levels, lung function and evidence of scarring,” the document says. The minutes of the February Sage meeting go on to highlight the need for better vaccine coverage among care home workers. Figures in the document suggest that about 95% of care home residents have received at least one shot of a vaccine, compared with only 65%-70% of care home workers. The low coverage is explained by a mix of poorer access to vaccines and some hesitancy to have the jab, the scientists believe. Though uptake is gradually improving, the committee warns that “in order to limit outbreaks through vaccination alone, staff coverage would need to increase to a minimum of 75% in every care home setting.”\\n',\n",

       "  'title': \"MSPs dismiss claims Sturgeon's husband conspired to destroy Salmond\",\n",
       "  'full_article': 'MSPs have dismissed allegations that messages sent by Nicola Sturgeon’s husband, Peter Murrell, and other senior Scottish National party officials, proved a conspiracy to destroy Alex Salmond. WhatsApp and text messages sent by Murrell, the SNP chief executive, have been central to Salmond’s claims of “malicious and concerted” efforts to search out alleged victims of sexual assault and pressurise the police to investigate. Extracts of the messages were leaked last year to Kenny MacAskill, an SNP MP who was previously Scotland’s justice secretary and is a Salmond ally, and fuelled claims that the party, government and prosecutors were colluding. One text from Murrell, on 25 January 2020, said it was a “good time to be pressurising” police as they were “twiddling their thumbs” during an apparent lull in their investigations. MSPs believe the full chain of texts refer to police requests for help in tracing victims. A second said: “The more fronts [Salmond] is having to firefight on the better for all complainers. So [Crown Prosecution Service] action would be a good thing.” MSPs believe that referred to the news the CPS was not taking any action after a Met police investigation into historical allegations in London. MSPs on a Scottish parliament inquiry into the Scottish government’s botched investigation of sexual assault allegations against Salmond, believe the full text messages are either justifiable or capable of having other, less sinister meanings. The Crown Office released the full texts, and those sent before and after them, after parliament issued another disclosure order instructing it to do so. The texts, while at times hyperbolic, were more innocuous than first appeared, committee members believe. They showed SNP officials and some complainers encouraging people to come forward, but not to the extent they established a conspiracy. It is understood the committee’s final report, to be published on 22 or 23 March, will reject Salmond’s allegations they prove unaccepted interference in the police investigation and collusion. However, the committee has not seen a batch of emails involving SNP officials who became complainers in Salmond’s criminal trial. Salmond believes those do show unjustified collusion, but they are not being sought because they relate directly to the trial. Salmond told the Holyrood inquiry last month he first saw those messages in January 2020, two months before he went on trial on 14 charges of sexual assault, including one attempted rape. He was acquitted of every charge. Reading them “was one of the most extraordinary days of my life”, he said. They showed “pressurising the police … pressurising witnesses and collusion with witnesses” and the “construction of evidence”. Murrell rejected Salmond’s claims the texts proved a conspiracy but, in his evidence session last month, acknowledged the language was inappropriate and “out of character.” He said: “To me, that suggests just how upset I was at the time.” Committee members believe Holyrood should publish the full exchanges, as there was a risk the selective leaking had mischaracterised them to the public. The committee has asked Murrell, and two other SNP officials involved in the discussions, Sue Ruddick, the chief operating officer, and Ian McCann, its compliance officer, for permission to publish them. The committee has yet to decide how they can see Scottish government emails that may show senior officials were unhappy about alleged interference in the internal inquiry into harassment complaints about Salmond, made by a government official. Salmond’s lawyers are said to hold those emails. MSPs decided earlier this week to issue Salmond’s lawyers with a disclosure order, but that is legally difficult. They may instead instruct the Crown Office to do so, with only a week left before the committee needs to complete its report.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'Climate experts in dismay at choice of Mathias Cormann as OECD chief',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Climate experts have expressed dismay at the choice of Mathias Cormann, a former finance minister in an Australian government with a record of strong hostility to climate action, as secretary general of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), an international institution that advises rich countries on policy and poor countries on how to become wealthier. Jennifer Morgan, the executive director of Greenpeace International, said: “We have little confidence in Cormann’s ability to ensure the OECD is a leader in tackling the climate crisis, when he has an atrocious record on the issue. If the OECD is to fulfil its mandate, it must confront the climate emergency, arguably the biggest social justice issue of our time.”   Related: Mathias Cormann elected OECD chief despite climate record   Nick Mabey, the chief executive of the E3G thinktank, said: “OECD countries have just sent a dangerous signal by appointing someone with a track record of dismantling climate policy to run their main advisory body. This appointment will lower pressure on the leaders of other international institutions to undertake radical reforms to tackle the climate crisis.” Developing countries were particularly concerned. Saleem Huq, the director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development in Bangladesh, said: “The appointment of a climate sceptic from Australia to head the OECD is very disappointing and will reduce the credibility of the OECD as an institution in the eyes of developing countries.” The UK government was also sharply criticised for its role in backing Cormann’s election as it prepares to host UN climate talks in Glasgow this November. Mohamed Adow, the director of the Power Shift Africa thinktank, said: “It’s terrible to see a politician with such a poor record on climate action getting the job of leading the OECD. What makes it worse is that apparently his appointment was backed by the UK, despite them [being] about to host the crucial Cop26 summit.” Cormann opposed climate action on many occasions while a government minister between 2013 and 2020. He voted down motions to declare a climate emergency, called net zero targets “extremist”, “reckless” and “irresponsible”, spoke in favour of the coal industry and against wind energy, and was criticised for telling young climate strikers to “stick to school”. Some climate experts, however, said Cormann could still carry on the OECD’s work on climate action despite his record. Some pointed privately to the World Bank, where the climate advocate Jim Yong Kim was replaced in 2019 by David Malpass, an adviser to Donald Trump with little previous enthusiasm for climate issues. Despite misgivings, the World Bank has retained a strong focus on climate action. The climate economist Nicholas Stern said: “Cormann comes from a government in Australia which has often been ambiguous at best in its commitment to tackling climate change. [He] must show the necessary commitment right from the start of his tenure. The world must act now and the OECD must continue to lead.” The OECD decision runs against the tide of recent appointments of senior figures to major international institutions. Officials with a track record of advocating strong climate action, many of them women, now lead several key organisations. Kristalina Georgieva, formerly of the World Bank and European commission, is chief of the International Monetary Fund, where she has made the climate a focus. Christine Lagarde, the head of the European Central Bank, spoke of the urgent need for climate action as the UK launched Cop26 last year, and Odile Renaud-Basso took over last year at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, where she has pledged to push climate action forward. The World Trade Organization is headed by Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, a former Nigerian finance minister who has long taken a strong stance on the climate. One of Cormann’s key actions while a government minister was to quash plans for carbon pricing. This stands in stark contrast to the man he has succeeded at the OECD, Ángel Gurría, who had been a prominent figure at international climate forums since his appointment in 2006.  In one of his last interviews as secretary general, Gurria told the Guardian: “The single most important intergenerational responsibility is to protect the planet. We are on a collision course with nature, and we have to change course for future generations; to protect biodiversity to stop it from being degraded; to protect soil; to protect lands and water; to protect the oceans … and put a big fat price on carbon.”\\n',\n",

       "  'full_article': 'A visit by Boris Johnson to Northern Ireland to promote its centenary and response to Covid-19 has triggered a political row with Sinn Féin, which branded his visit a publicity stunt. The prime minister went to a vaccination centre in County Fermanagh and unveiled plans to mark the state’s foundation a 100 years ago during a one-day visit on Friday. Sinn Féin’s deputy first minister, Michelle O’Neill, did not welcome Johnson to Belfast or attend any of his events after he declined to meet her and Sinn Féin’s leader, Mary Lou McDonald, to discuss the Stormont executive and post-Brexit arrangements. The party accused him of reneging on commitments. Arlene Foster, the first minister and Democratic Unionist party leader, urged the prime minister to “stand up for Northern Ireland” and replace “intolerable” post-Brexit checks on goods arriving from Great Britain. In an apparent olive branch to Foster, Johnson visited a vaccination centre in her native Fermanagh.     Earlier the government unveiled plans to mark the centenary of Northern Ireland, which include tree-planting, a postmark, a church service, an investment conference and possibly a meeting of G7 trade and finance ministers. Official events include a concert, academic seminars and the presentation of a centenary rose – a mix of rose pink, ivory and yellow – to the Queen. There will be a ceremony at Belfast city hall to mark the 100th anniversary of the opening of Northern Ireland’s parliament on 22 June 1921 by King George V. Approximately £1m has been awarded to 39 community projects which will mark the centenary. The creation of Northern Ireland paved the way for the formation of the UK as it is today, Johnson said. “Our centenary programme will reflect on the past and on the people and developments that make Northern Ireland the great place it is today. The activities will pay tribute to all those who have worked tirelessly to support Northern Ireland throughout the pandemic, and will champion the incredible young people in Northern Ireland who offer so much to the shared success of our United Kingdom.” Brandon Lewis, the Northern Ireland secretary, told the Belfast News Letter that the government was considering hosting a meeting of G7 trade and finance ministers – an offshoot of the main G7 meeting of world leaders – in Northern Ireland in June. He said: “If we’re not trumpeting what’s brilliant about Northern Ireland, and the reasons to invest in Northern Ireland, we can’t expect others to do it for us.”   In the 100 years since its formation, Northern Ireland and its people have enriched our Union beyond measure. I hope the Centenary programme we have announced today will leave a positive and enduring legacy. ✍🏻 @BelTel https://t.co/F6RhmsLB9b— Brandon Lewis (@BrandonLewis) March 12, 2021  However, Covid-19 and a fraught political climate have overshadowed the centenary. The Orange Order has postponed a planned parade to Stormont, the seat of Northern Ireland’s assembly, because of pandemic restrictions. Uncertainty hangs over other gatherings. Unionist parties and loyalist groups are waging a campaign against post-Brexit rules that require checks on goods coming in from Great Britain. They have accused Downing Street of betrayal and undermining Northern Ireland’s status in the UK. Sinn Féin and the SDLP refused to participate in a centenary advisory panel, reflecting Irish nationalism’s enduring sense of grievance that a war of independence wrested 26 counties in the south from British control but not six counties in the north, where a Protestant majority wanted to stay in the UK.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'Suspicion stalked Sky but British public bought into success story',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Few of those in European cycling’s professional milieu, long schooled in batting away doping suspicions, will be shocked by the findings of the Richard Freeman medical tribunal. Cycling, after all, has a long history of “dodgy doctors”, the most renowned of all being Michele Ferrari, Lance Armstrong’s infamous performance guru. In a sport long shadowed by scandal, the wondrous achievements of Team Sky under the management of Dave Brailsford were always viewed sceptically. But this is also a story of subterfuge, failed vetting procedures and manipulation of facts, even before a government select committee.   Related: Team Sky and British Cycling in dock after Freeman guilty verdict   In Britain, a nation and media largely naive to the inner workings of the professional peloton and dazzled by the slew of successes in both track and road racing swallowed the story of marginal gains and magical pillows, whole. Now the scepticism that was always bubbling under the surface in Europe towards the explosion of British success appears even more well-founded. The Freeman verdict, that the former Team Sky and British Cycling doctor was guilty of ordering testosterone “knowing or believing” it was to be given to a rider to improve their athletic performance, is damning and has led to UK Anti-Doping bringing further charges of doping infractions against him. Brailsford has not yet responded to the Guardian’s requests for comment. Throughout their sponsorship, however, Team Sky always stuck to the line used at their team launch: “We follow the rules and we ride clean.” After the Freeman verdict was announced, Ineos Grenadiers, the current incarnation of that team, issued a statement saying: “It is very clear from their report that Richard Freeman fell short of the ethical standards required of him as a doctor and acted dishonestly. However, the Team does not believe that any athlete ever used or sought to use Testogel or any other performance enhancing substance.” However, hard as they try, this is a story that Brailsford and his staff, past and present, at British Cycling and Team Sky and now Ineos Grenadiers, can no longer evade. Brian Cookson, the president of British Cycling between 1996 and 2013, was more forthcoming than Brailsford. “I was proud and privileged to have overseen a period of unprecedented success in the sport, leading to a massive increase in its popularity and profile,” Cookson said. “That this should now be open to question is a matter of extreme concern to me and all of those who work or have worked behind the scenes in our sport, in governance, management, administration and coaching.” Prior to the arrival of Brailsford and Team Sky, doping had long dominated the European cycling headlines. A decade or more of debilitating revelations, from the Festina affair, Operation Puerto, the Floyd Landis scandal, and in late 2012, the downfall of Lance Armstrong, had crippled the peloton’s credibility. In 2010 Team Sky came to the rescue, proclaiming their integrity, their vetting skills and their credibility, vowing to win the Tour de France “clean”. It was a message that was a breath of fresh air for fans, weary of years of doubt and disappointment. In Britain, the sales pitch of Sky as cycling’s saviours was embraced almost unquestioningly. Yet within a sport that is still haunted by its past, there were always whispers of just how close to rule-breaking the team would go. In Europe, suspicion stalked the team after they reversed the poor performances of their early outings into the all-conquering Grand Tour successes of Wiggins, Froome and Thomas.    Ineos Grenadiers said: ‘It is very clear from their report that Richard Freeman [pictured] fell short of the ethical standards required of him.’ Photograph: Eleanor Crooks/PA   There were furores over their admitted use of the potent painkiller tramadol, now banned by cycling’s governing body, and obfuscation and confusion over the use of therapeutic use exemptions (TUEs) by both Bradley Wiggins and Chris Froome. Froome, who benefitted from a TUE in April 2014, when he won the Tour of Romandie, told the BBC a year later that he had declined a TUE in the latter stages of the 2015 Tour de France because “it did not sit well morally with me”. A further problem for Brailsford and his management structures is that Freeman is not the first “dodgy doctor”. Wiggins’s career-making golden summer of 2012, which included multiple stage race wins, Tour de France success and Olympic glory, was achieved when Geert Leinders, now banned for life for doping offences, was retained as a medical consultant. Brailsford maintained that Leinders was always a distant presence, but subsequently admitted to an error of judgment in hiring a man whose name became a byword for doping in the Netherlands, where he worked for the disgraced Rabobank team. But then Sky’s zero tolerance policy, based on recruiting from a pool of professionals in which it was impossible to guarantee propriety, had been unworkable from the outset. The team’s much-vaunted vetting procedures failed abjectly, when they were forced to shed staff – such as Bobby Julich and Steven de Jongh, supposedly scrupulously vetted by Brailsford and Steve Peters – who had subsequently admitted an involvement in doping earlier in their careers. Yet Brailsford, whether scrutinised by the media, catcalled by roadside fans, or grilled by a digital, culture, media and sport committee in Westminster, has ploughed on regardless. The big wins kept on coming, even as the doctors came and went. Recently he has talked of having “more fun” with cycling, although that seems less likely given the latest turn of events.   Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors’ picks.  Brailsford was talked about, but never seen, during the Freeman hearings. Now many will ask where is the man the French media once knowingly titled “Monsieur Zero Tolerance” in all this? As he has been so often during the difficult moments, the architect of the British cycling success story, from its beginnings through to the present day, remains the Invisible Man. And what will Jim Ratcliffe’s view be of the Freeman verdict? Two years ago, when the Ineos takeover of Team Sky’s personnel and infrastructure was unveiled, the billionaire entrepreneur sat alongside Brailsford and made his ethical position clear. “We did our due diligence,” he said. “I have absolutely no interest in cheating or drugs. The day that any of that enters our world, we’ll be exiting that world.”\\n',\n",

       "  'full_article': 'A few months after the Christchurch mosque attacks, Aya Al-Umari went on a pilgrimage to Mecca, and from there to Abu Dhabi, where she and her brother Hussein grew up. The trip was a major step towards accepting her brother’s death, she says. “I wanted to go down the memory lane of our childhood.” She went to the pool they swam in, the alleys in which they played, and the last apartment where they lived, which has “sweet home” written on the entrance. “I knew I couldn’t just walk in or was too shy to ask, but I just wanted to see the door,” she says. As she travelled she took pictures of herself and a photo of her brother that she took with her, comforted to feel his presence in the familiar places of their childhood.    Aya holds up a picture of herself and her brother Hussein in front of the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque in Abu Dhabi Photograph: Aya Al-Umari   Aya’s family is originally from Iraq. Her parents left for the United Arab Emirates when the Iran-Iraq War broke out in 1980, before the civil defence sirens went off and the first missiles hit border towns. Hussein and Aya were born in Abu Dhabi, Hussein arriving in 1984 and Aya two years later. In 1997, the family arrived in New Zealand, a country far from the ravages of war and renowned for its peacefulness. “If Hussein were killed in Iraq,” Aya says, “no one would have cared as much, because thousands are being killed there every year.” On the afternoon of 15 March 2019, Aya was in her office, unaware of what was unfolding on the other side of the city. Then she started receiving messages from her mother, asking her to get hold of Hussein. She called him frantically, only to be directed to his voicemail. “I was conflicted about where to go, to his house or the mosque”, Aya says, “or whether the whole thing was real.” In the meantime the city had turned into a war zone and police officers were everywhere.    Aya and Hussein at a party in Christchurch Photograph: Ces Photography cecilio Barra Iii/Aya Al-Umari   Aya somehow managed to get to her brother’s house, but there was no sign of him. “I was thinking that he is not home, which meant that he is in the hospital.” The family was forced to exist in a state of limbo for six long days before police finally asked the family to identify Hussein’s body. He was the last victim to be identified. Even though it took almost a week for the family to get confirmation of his death, “We started grieving the day after [the attack],” Aya says. Police warned the family that they might be shocked upon seeing his body, but Aya believes that “Hussein was at peace”, the main characteristic of a Shaheed, an Islamic term used to refer to those who are thought to have been killed for their faith. In the aftermath of the attack there was an outpouring of support for the victims and their families. One woman delivered homemade soup to Aya and her family every day for several weeks. “It was a small gesture, but it meant the world to us,” says Aya.    Flowers outside the Al Noor mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand in the days following the 15 March 2019 shooting Photograph: Jorge Silva/Reuters   The flower wall by Al Noor mosque became a symbol of New Zealanders’ condemnation of the horrific crime and their support for the Muslim community. Two years on, commuters still stop by 101 Deans Avenue to place flowers next to the mosque’s entrance. This is not to say that hate towards immigrants has miraculously disappeared. Aya and her mother were recently subjected to a racist rant in a Waimakariri shopping mall, after a stranger heard them talking in Arabic. “While we tried to diffuse her racial tirade towards us by telling her we lost our brother in the terrorist attack, it’s sad that it happened in the first place. It was important for me to call it out,” Aya says. During the sentencing of Brenton Tarrant in August, Hussein’s mother forgave him for the murder of her son. “I decided to forgive you Mr Tarrant because I don’t have hate. I don’t have revenge … Damage was done, and Hussein will never be here, so I have only one choice and [that is] to forgive you,” Janna Ezat told the court. Aya described the devastating scenes she had witnessed in Christchurch hospital: “I will never ever forget the distressing scenes of people covered in blood, and the weeping sound of children crying. These images and sounds will stay in my mind for ever,” she said.    Aya Al-Umari, pictured overlooking the city of Christchurch, New Zealand Photograph: Peter Meecham/The Guardian   Immediately after the attack, the video livestreamed by the shooter was circulating online. Aya could not initially locate her brother in it, but she heard him shouting “Get out, Get out” in Arabic. This was later confirmed by witness accounts. The internal CCTV footage was later reviewed by the police who said that Hussein had also gestured at the terrorist with his palms raised. It is not possible to know what was going on inside Hussein’s head, but his family believe he acted heroically in those moments, attempting to position himself to tackle the shooter. “My family knew Hussein wouldn’t run away,” Aya says.    A photo taken on Hussein’s birthday. Aya and Hussein’s mother, Janna Ezat, can be seen preparing food in the background. Photograph: Aya Al-Umari   Aya and Hussein’s relationship was like that of most other siblings, but Aya cherishes every single moment she spent with her brother. “During all these years, Hussein hugged me whenever he came to our home or I went to his. He always hugged me.” Their birthdays were just one day apart and the pair always celebrated together. Since the 2019 attacks, Aya has been volunteering as a security guard at Al Noor mosque. She does that, Aya says, “to live Hussein’s legacy and to honour what he has done.” Towards the end of the interview, Aya says her family will be moving to Auckland soon. Can they no longer tolerate the city of Christchurch and the painful memories it holds? “No, that’s not the case at all. We’re not escaping. This is just a step forward.”  This article was translated by Mohsen Kafi, a PhD researcher in literary translation studies at Victoria University of Wellington.

The outcry over Doug Ford’s comments highlights the sensitivity of the accusations as well as the broader challenges of addressing vaccine hesitancy in Indigenous communities, a group that still faces discrimination within the healthcare system. At Ontario’s legislative assembly on Thursday, Ford denounced Sol Mamakwa for “jumping the line” to receive shots. Mamakwa received his vaccine in two remote communities at the request of their leadership. “I talked to a few chiefs that were pretty upset about that, for flying into a community that he doesn’t belong to,” Ford said, without naming those chiefs. The premier’s office initially said he had no plans to apologize, but on Friday afternoon issued a statement saying Ford had phoned Mamakwa to express his regret for his comments.  Mamakwa, a member of the New Democratic party and resident of King Fisher First Nation in northern Ontario, is the only lawmaker in the provincial legislature from a First Nations community. In March, he was invited by leaders of two fly-in communities – Muskrat Dam and Sandy Lake – to help combat vaccine hesitancy among residents. He posted on social media about his vaccination. On Thursday, Mamakwa expressed dismay over Ford’s “lack of respect” towards Indigenous peoples. “It was a hard decision for me to make even to go [get] the vaccine because of this,” he said “It’s not jumping the line, but providing leadership.” After he went to the communities, both within his electoral district of Kiiwetinoong, more residents signed up to get their vaccine. Opposition leaders also demanded that Ford apologize to Mamakwa and First Nation residents. “Vaccine hesitancy is a reality in many communities as a result of generations of systemic racism, historic traumas and poor treatment by the health system,” the NDP leader, Andrea Horwath, told reporters. “[Mamakwa] did what all of us are called to do. He stepped up, he led by example and he continues to be a big part of the efforts to show that the vaccine is safe.” Ontario’s health minister, Christine Elliott, defended Ford, saying the premier was simply expressing frustration because of the “continuing work” of vaccinating First Nations people. “Everyone needs to wait their turn. I’m not sure whether [Mr Mamakwa] was in the lineup for a vaccine or not,” she said.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'Fernando Alonso to make F1 comeback with titanium plates in his jaw',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Fernando Alonso will make his Formula One comeback this season with titanium plates in his jaw. The double world champion had the plates inserted after a cycling accident in February, he revealed on the first day of testing in Bahrain. On track, Red Bull’s Max Verstappen headed the time sheets while Mercedes suffered a setback, losing almost their entire morning running because of a mechanical problem. Alonso does not foresee the accident having any impact on his performance. “I don’t expect any issues,” he said. “I’ve been training for three weeks or two weeks, absolutely normal, and I’ve been in the simulator as well. One thing is the professional side and driving side, which is 100%. On the personal side I will have to remove two titanium plates that I have on the upper jaw, that will be removed at the end of the season.”   Related: Silverstone will host new F1 sprint race before 2021 British Grand Prix   Alonso will drive for Alpine this season, formerly the Renault team, with whom he won both titles in 2005 and 2006. He left F1 in 2019 frustrated at being unable to challenge at the front but is optimistic that when new regulations come into play in 2022 Alpine will be able to fight for wins and potentially the title. Testing has been restricted to three days this year, making track time vital, but Mercedes experienced early difficulties. They had to change the gearbox on their car after only one lap for Valtteri Bottas. They did so but Bottas had time to conclude only six laps before the end of the session. The team principal, Toto Wolff, admitted the problem had taken the team by surprise and that they could not afford to lose any more time. “It wasn’t a good start, because we had a gearbox issue that came out of nowhere that we haven’t yet been ready to identify and understand,” he said. “If we are able to have a smoother ride from here onwards, then I think we can recover. If we have more stumbling blocks, then obviously with three days there’s not a lot you can do.”   Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors’ picks.  The defending champion Lewis Hamilton took the wheel in the afternoon despite the Sakhir circuit being swept by a sandstorm and completed 42 laps, finishing 10th fastest. Mercedes, however, concluded with just 48 laps, the lowest of any team. In contrast Red Bull were out of the blocks with alacrity. Verstappen finished with 139 laps – two race distances – a very positive sign for their new Honda engine, and the Dutchman went quickest in front of McLaren’s Lando Norris and Alpine’s Esteban Ocon.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'London Isis supporter found guilty of plotting terror attack',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'An Islamic State supporter who rapped about decapitations and wearing suicide vests has been found guilty of plotting to run amok with a sword during the coronavirus lockdown. Sahayb Abu, 27, had bought two blades, balaclavas, a camouflage hat and body armour online in readiness for the planned terror attack last summer, the Old Bailey heard. He was arrested on 9 July after discussing guns with an undercover police officer, who he met on an Isis supporters’ Telegram chat group. A jury deliberated for 21 hours and 32 minutes to find him guilty of preparing for terrorist acts by a majority of 11 to one. His brother, Muhamed Abu, 32, wept as he was cleared of failing to disclose information about a plot to authorities. He appeared distressed at his sibling’s conviction, sobbing: “He’s a clown, he’s a buffoon.” Following the verdicts, Commander Richard Smith said Sahayb Abu was a “very dangerous individual”, despite portraying himself as a clownish aspiring rapper called Masked Menace. Smith, the head of the Met’s counter-terrorism command, said: “There is no doubt in my mind that Sahayb had murderous intent, some of that was evidenced from the kind of things that he was posting online and sharing with others, including his brother.” The court heard how some of the defendants’ relatives had been linked to extremism in the past. The defendants’ half-brothers Wail and Suleyman Aweys went to Syria in 2015, where they are both believed to have died, the court was told. Two years later, the court heard, the defendants were caught with their older half-brother Ahmed Aweys putting up poppy posters in east London saying British tax was used to “kill Muslims”. Sahayb Abu, from Dagenham in east London, went on to associate with known terrorists while serving a sentence for burglary at Wandsworth prison in south London. Among them was the Isis supporter Husnain Rashid, who was jailed for at least 25 years in 2018 for calling for an attack on Prince George. Sahayb Abu was released from prison on 20 March last year, and went from being “locked up to locked down” as the Covid-19 pandemic struck, jurors heard. Over the next three months, he trawled the internet for Isis propaganda, including pictures of fighters in balaclavas with guns. He posed in his combat gear in homemade videos sent to Muhamed Abu. In a disturbing rap, he described the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, as a “sellout” and talked about the murdered fusilier Lee Rigby. He also posted extremist comments online and came to the attention of the undercover officer via the Telegram chat group. The pair met twice, and during their conversations used code words “silah” and “duty free” for firearms, which the officer claimed he could import. Sahayb Abu said the time was coming to be an “action man rather than a chatty man” and commented “we need a 9/11 2.0”, in reference to the World Trade Center attacks in New York. Police took the decision to arrest the brothers on 9 July last year.\\n',\n",

       "  'full_article': 'Royal Mail is piloting a Sunday parcel delivery service for big retailers from this weekend, after the coronavirus pandemic sparked a boom in online shopping. A number of retail brands will begin trialling the new Sunday parcel service across the UK, and Royal Mail is talking to other retailers about offering the service to their customers. The company described the trial as the “first salvo” in its move into the seven-day-a-week delivery market. Rivals DPD and Hermes already do Sunday deliveries for big retailers such as Amazon. Royal Mail said it had processed “unprecedented” numbers of parcels in the last year, delivering a record 496m in the Christmas quarter to 27 December, 30% higher than the same period in 2019. In a big shift, revenues from parcels overtook revenues from letters for the first time in the six months to 27 September. However, the postal service has been hit by long delays in recent months due to staff contracting coronavirus or self-isolating. The group is building a second, larger parcel hub in Daventry in the Midlands as it pivots from delivering letters to parcels. The new hub will be the size of more than 10 football pitches, capable of processing more than 1m parcels a day. Royal Mail also launched a parcel collect service last autumn for people who want to return items they bought online. Nick Landon, chief commercial officer at Royal Mail, said: “The UK already trusts us to deliver their purchases six days a week both quickly and conveniently. Now for the first time our posties will be doing the same thing seven days a week. The last year has reset so many customer expectations and the desire for even more convenient and even more frequent parcel deliveries has certainly been one of them.”   Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk   The company already piloted Sunday parcel deliveries within the M25 area in 2014 but decided against rolling out the service then. A spokesperson said: “It was a completely different time then. We were very early adopters … We’re now seeing those seismic changes in consumer behaviour and the pandemic has accelerated it. We are all locked down at home and so what do we do? We go on the laptop and order things we like.” He said research carried out by Royal Mail showed that 25% of its customers wanted Sunday deliveries, a number that rose to 40% of younger customers, under 45.\\n',\n",

       "  'full_article': 'The Council of Europe is to reopen its review into the 1989 murder of the Belfast solicitor Patrick Finucane, an attack found to have involved British state collusion. Finucane, who represented a number of high-profile republicans, was shot dead in front of his family by loyalist gunmen in one of the most notorious killings of the Troubles in Northern Ireland. The council, which oversees the European court of human rights (ECHR), made the announcement on Friday after the UK government’s decision last November not to hold a public inquiry. It followed a meeting of the Council of Europe attended by representatives of the 47 member states. “The committee of ministers decided to reopen its consideration of the Finucane case in order to supervise the ongoing measures to ensure that they are adequate, sufficient and proceed in a timely manner,” it said in a statement. The body said it would like the UK authorities to clarify how police and police ombudsman processes dealing with the Finucane case “will proceed promptly and in line” with ECHR standards. It means the British state’s actions on the case – or inactions – will remain under international scrutiny. The ECHR had ruled against the UK in 2003, deeming the investigation into Finucane’s murder inadequate. The court closed its case in 2009, when it urged the UK to discuss a public inquiry with the solicitor’s family.  The solicitor’s son John, a Sinn Féin MP for North Belfast, welcomed the Council of Europe’s decision to reopen the case.  The Council of Europe has reopened the investigation into my father’s killing.This is a hugely significant move.The British govt have been criticised internationally for their failure to establish an inquiry & this level of scrutiny is vital to ensure truth can finally emerge pic.twitter.com/pQtQBHfWtm— John Finucane MP (@johnfinucane) March 12, 2021  Simon Coveney, Ireland’s foreign minister, said it underpinned the Irish government’s desire for a full and independent public inquiry. “This will facilitate full and thorough scrutiny of the steps to be taken in the period ahead, and to ensure that an inquiry that meets the United Kingdom’s obligations under Article 2 of the convention is carried out.” The decision is the latest twist in a legal saga that has pitted the Finucane family and its supporters in a decades-long quest to extract information from the state about the murder. Brian Nelson, who directed this and other loyalist attacks, was an agent controlled by the British army’s force research unit. Last November Brandon Lewis, the Northern Ireland secretary, acknowledged state collusion and apologised to the Finucane family for their suffering but said there would be no inquiry pending a new police review of the murder, drawing condemnation from the Finucane family. The committee of ministers regularly assesses the implementation of ECHR judgments. It has become increasingly concerned over what it sees as the UK’s failure to enforce rulings requiring effective investigations into controversial killings during the Troubles.\\n',\n",

       "  'full_article': 'Carlo Ancelotti has said Alex Iwobi should tell him face-to-face where he prefers to play at Everton rather than resort to cryptic complaints on social media. Iwobi marked his selection for Nigeria’s forthcoming internationals against Benin and Lesotho with an Instagram post on Tuesday that read: “Always an honour to get a call up to my national team. Hopefully I get to play in my preferred position.” The 24-year-old did not specify whether he was referring to club or country but posted the comment a day after being substituted in the 56th minute against Chelsea. He was also withdrawn in the 58th minute of Everton’s previous game at West Bromwich Albion, and has been substituted in his last six starts.   Related: Chris Wilder latest, Premier League team news and more – live!   Ancelotti rarely criticises his players in public but has been bemused by Iwobi’s comment. The Everton manager, who has played the £34m signing in several roles, cited Andrea Pirlo as an example of the benefits of more open communication. “I read the post. I want to speak to him, of course,” said Ancelotti. “I want to know his preferred position because usually I want to put a player on the pitch where they are comfortable to play, not where they are uncomfortable to play. If he has an idea of where he prefers to play I have to know, I want to know. I would be delighted to know his preferred position and I’ll put him in his preferred position for sure, no doubt. “I am going to tell him: ‘Tell me, I am your manager, tell me where you want to play’. When I thought to put Pirlo as a holding midfielder I asked him: ‘Do you like to play there or not?’. ‘Yes’, he said to me, ‘I’d love to play there’ and so I put him there. If he wants to play number 10 or number nine I’ll put him at number 10 or number nine no problem. I can adapt the system.” Ancelotti confirmed Everton will be without Abdoulaye Doucouré for eight to 10 weeks after the influential midfielder suffered a fracture in his foot. James Rodríguez also remains on the sidelines, with Everton deciding to rest the Colombia playmaker until he makes a full recovery from the calf problem that has hindered him for several months.   The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.  The Everton manager explained: “James played really well against Manchester United and Liverpool but he was not 100% fit and had little problems. For the fact we are going to have really important games until the end of the season we decided to give him a proper recovery and don’t let him play at 70-80%. He has to recover and when he is 100% fit he will play again. We have taken this decision together, we have no problem with the player, the player has agreed. “We don’t want him to play and risk a bigger injury. We want to avoid this kind of tightness he has after 45-60 minutes of a game so we have to do a proper recovery with special exercises for him to improve his calf condition.”\\n',\n",

       "  'full_article': \"Jimmy Kimmel Thursday, 11 March, marked one year since the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus a global pandemic, and to observe the dismal year of an endless March, Jimmy Kimmel hosted his “first and hopefully last” coronaversary show in sweatpants, with extra toilet paper on hand. “Remember when we were carefully disassembling our Instacart deliveries like a munitions expert in The Hurt Locker or something?” he recalled of quarantine’s frenzied early days. “If somebody said N95 to you one year ago, you would think they were a bingo caller.”    “We haven’t been able to see friends, hug loved ones – I miss physical contact so much I applied for a job at Governor Cuomo’s office last month,” he joked. It’s “hard to believe we’ve been in for a whole year since people were dancing in clubs, people were eating in crowded restaurants, passing bongs around the beach, partying like it’s 1999”, Kimmel added over footage of people partying in large groups on the beach. “It seems like yesterday. And you know what? That was yesterday. Those clips were from Texas and Florida, yesterday.”   Related: Kimmel on Biden's Covid relief bill: 'Naturally, Republicans are against it'   Joe Biden struck a note of optimism in his first primetime address as president on Thursday, as he promised vaccine eligibility for all American adults by 1 May and touted the possibility of outdoor group gatherings for the 4th of July. The speech came exactly one year after Donald Trump downplayed the severity of the virus in primetime, calling the risk “very, very low”. “That’s what they say about owning a casino, and he bankrupted three of those,” Kimmel quipped. Stephen Colbert “I think we all remember where we were when we heard the news” of the pandemic “because we’re all still there”, Stephen Colbert lamented on Thursday’s Late Show in observance of the pandemic’s first anniversary. “Of course, it’s also the one-year anniversary of the first time I Lysol-ed a banana,” he added.    Colbert recalled his naivety about the pandemic at the time; in a clip from his first at-home show, he urged viewers to “get comfortable” as experts expected Americans to stay home for eight weeks. “First it was going to be eight weeks, then Easter, then Memorial Day, then July – it was worse than waiting for the cable guy!” Colbert joked. “The CDC should have just issued a statement that said: “Your pandemic will end shortly, please be home between the hours of 8am and three years from now.’” Colbert also touched on Biden’s primetime speech, which honored the sacrifices made during the pandemic while previewing a “return to some sense of normalcy”. “OK that sounds nice, but what the hell constitutes normalcy,” Colbert wondered. “Even before the Covid, there was systemic racism, global warming, half of us heard ‘Yanny’, the other half heard ‘Laurel’, the world is chaos.” To advocate for his administration’s vaccination plan, the Biden administration also unveiled a public service announcement featuring the Obamas, Bill Clinton, George W Bush and his wife Laura, and even 96-year-old Jimmy Carter. “But there’s no sign of the last guy,” Colbert observed. “Maybe his invite got lost in the mail because he destroyed the postal service.” Seth Meyers    And on Late Night, Seth Meyers mourned a year since “we all trapped ourselves inside our homes with stockpiles of gin and red wine watching Tiger King and Love is Blind while clinging to our last shreds of toilet paper like a plank floating in the water after a shipwreck”. It’s also been a year since Trump delivered a rambling, off-script address to the nation in which he downplayed the risks of the virus. “Trump’s bizarre, half-hearted speech one year ago is in stunning contrast to the seriousness and gravitas of the speech President Biden delivered tonight, exactly one year later, to mark the pain the country has endured while also offering hope for the future,” said Meyers, noting the $1.9tn Covid stimulus bill Biden signed on Thursday. The bill is enormously popular, with 75% of Americans and 59% of Republicans approving the measure, “and yet Republicans have derided it as a so-called partisan bill”, said Meyers. But some of the “most galling behavior”, he added, came from Republicans who tried to take credit for aspects of the bill while still voting against it, such as Senator Roger Wicker, a “no” vote who tweet-bragged about stimulus money for small businesses. “I know these guys are shameless, but I’m still shocked,” said Meyers. “They’re the kind of guys who would run out and try and lift Tom Brady on their shoulders while wearing Chiefs jerseys.”\\n\",\n",

As Sheffield United as Bramall Lane, Sean Bean and refusing to get out of bed on a particular day of the week because it’s called Wednesday. At the time of writing your Friday Fiver, it remains unclear whether Chris Wilder chose to leave, or has been sacked as Sheffield United boss. Either way, it doesn’t matter. He’s gone and we can only imagine that leaving the club in which he has invested almost a lifetime of blood, sweat and tears across a little over half a century is bound to be a wrench.   Related: Chris Wilder latest, Premier League team news and more – live!   In five years in the job, he defied expectations by taking the club from League One to the dizzy heights of a ninth place finish in last season’s Premier League, a feat that surprised many informed pundits who had confidently predicted that a campaign spent getting Simon Tracey to lump the ball long to Brian Deane or Alan Cork would almost certainly end in relegation. As well-researched as they were, these footballing experts and opinion-formers could scarcely have been more wrong and Wilder raised eyebrows and expectations with his habit of repeatedly bamboozling opposing managers with his new-fangled tactics of employing overlapping centre-backs while shouting “BASHY! BASHY! BASHY! BASHY! BASHY! BASHY! BASHY! BASHY! BASHY!” a lot. The results were devastatingly effective. The results this season have been devastatingly ineffective. With his team anchored to the foot of the table and heading back to the Championship, Wilder retained the unequivocal support of most Blades fans but had made no secret of unrest “behind the scenes”. Having shelled out more than £30m on two strikers, one of whom has got two goals with the other yet to score, club owner Sheikh Abdullah remains in favour of putting somebody other than Wilder in charge of a club war-chest currently padlocked and emblazoned with a cautionary photo of an apologetic looking Rhian Brewster. While the Sheikh has “give it t’Heckingbottom” for the timebeing, Eddie Howe is already being touted as Wilder’s potential replacement, while we are also contractually obliged to mention Frank Lampard. Meanwhile, various luminaries of the English game and Peter Shilton have been voicing their disquiet at the turn of events. “Surely it won’t be long before Chris Wilder is back in football after being sacked at Sheffield United,” said Peter Shilton, taking time out from tweeting about how great Brexit is and warning of an imminent reckoning for Harry and Meghan over their shoddy treatment of the queen. Gary Lineker, Martin Keown and no end of Sheffield United fans have also paid homage to Wilder. “If he would be [at Man City], he would fight to be champion,” said Pep Guardiola earlier today. “If I was in Sheffield maybe I’d fight not to be relegated.” With their much-loved leader gone, that’s a potential job swap most Sheffield United fans could probably get on board with.

       "  'full_article': 'Katie Engelhart described the courageous 82-year-old Avril Henry, who lived alone, had no close family, was wracked by multiple but untreatable problems so common in elderly people, and had had enough of her previously full life (‘My body is unserviceable and well past its sell-by date’: the last days of Avril Henry, 9 March). She was, she said, “dying of everything and of nothing in particular”. And yet, fully mentally competent, she was not able to have the assisted death she earnestly and logically craved. She had to do it herself, but not before the police, accompanied by a social worker, a doctor and a psychiatrist, had broken down her front door in their unsuccessful search for the illegally-imported poison she later used. This cannot be right in a civilised country. A change in the law to allow assisted dying must surely come. A majority of the UK population want it to. We have a chance to realise this in the new Scottish parliament, for which we will be voting in May. Prof Charles Warlow Edinburgh • How promising that the increasingly impossible goal of achieving a natural death has been so bravely tackled in Katie Engelhart’s piece.  Several years ago when consulting a professor on a possible hernia repair, I was blithely informed that the body in question was no longer functioning as it should and that I had “lived too long”. No solution to this was offered. At the time (then in my early 70s) I felt rather indignant. However, with increasing age and decrepitude, I have had to recognise the truth in his statement and with that comes a growing concern that the final decision does not rest with the individual, as it should, but with the medical profession. Why indeed should we be forced to suffer needlessly? A change in the law is long overdue. A really suitable subject for a referendum, I think. Pamela Attwood New Malden, London • Thank you for your excellent article on old age suicide, which should help to promote an understanding of the need for people coming to the end of their lives to be able to choose when they wish to die. But can I fill in a gap in the information you gave? The article talked about the Society for Old Age Rational Suicide (Soars), but didn’t say that it is now called My Death My Decision (MDMD). As part of the Assisted Dying Coalition, it is now campaigning strongly for an assisted dying law that is not limited to terminally ill people. This should help to alleviate the very distressing situations in which people like Avril find themselves, and mean that they no longer have to go to such extraordinary lengths, on their own, to try and choose the time and manner of their death. Carolyn Sugden Birmingham • The law is designated for all of us at all times, not to serve the requirements of individuals, whatever their difficulties. The laws against killing protect the healthy majority; the removal of this law could put most elderly, disabled, depressed or simply deluded people under pressure to evaluate the efficacy of their lives, while not wanting to be a burden to their carers or loved ones. It is no coincidence that regular scrutiny of this fundamental, protective law has arisen in the era of state-of-the-art economic efficiency.

We have spent years being taught what we, as women, should do to keep ourselves safe. As 12-year-olds at an all-girls’ secondary school, we were given a specific lesson in how to avoid attack. We were taught to carry a key poking out of our fists as we walk, to sit near the bus driver, to choose brightly lit streets. We were each given a rape alarm. My brothers attended the equivalent boys’ school. There was no equivalent lesson. These are messages about personal safety that are often passed from woman to woman. They are well-intended and come from a place of care and love, but how come it is still so widely accepted in society that it is a woman’s responsibility to prevent an attack? In the UK, one in four women will experience domestic abuse and one in five will experience sexual assault during her lifetime. The number of rape prosecutions is falling year-on-year despite a much greater rise in the number of cases being reported, according to the Rape Monitoring Group. While we teach women to adapt their lives to keep safe, there is little work being done to educate men against chauvinistic attitudes or aggressions, such as wolf-whistling, that make so many environments hostile for women. It’s time that as a society, rather than teach women to live in fear, we address the attitudes, behaviour and violence that lie at the root of it. There is no comfort in this being a rare event. It should not be luck that we make it home from a walk.Emma Burke Richmond, London\\n',\n",

Your recent review of Peter Oborne’s book with the aforementioned title highlighted how Boris Johnson now tells lies with impunity (3 February). This cannot be allowed to continue. The prime minister “misspoke” at Wednesday’s PMQs when he said, several times, that Labour had voted against a NHS pay deal (Untouchable Boris? Bluster-busting Starmer could well put him on the back foot again, 10 March). At the end of the session, Jonathan Ashworth raised the matter with the Speaker as a point of order. He accepted what Ashworth said as a point of clarification. It has to be more than that. The Speaker must uphold the convention that ministers give accurate information to parliament, “correcting any inadvertent error at the earliest opportunity”. Johnson’s press secretary, Allegra Stratton, later declined 12 times to accept he had been wrong. Parliament and the public deserve to be told the truth and when that does not happen the record needs to be corrected. Barbara Veale London • Now that our political discourse is littered with untruths, isn’t it time to discontinue the ludicrous “unparliamentary language” rule that forbids MPs from pointing out that one of their number has lied in the House of Commons? Not so long ago lying in politics was a sackable offence; it happened to Boris Johnson in 2004. It was deemed so serious in the 1960s that John Profumo resigned and devoted his life to charity work after having done so. Nowadays, lying is not punished, but pointing out a lie is.

       "  'title': 'Duggie Fields obituary',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Quite what the dispute between Duggie Fields and his tutor at the Chelsea School of Art was about has been long forgotten; Fields’ protest has not. Always a snazzy dresser, on that day in college in the 1960s, Fields, who has died aged 75, unpinned the Donald Duck badge attached to the lapel of his black velvet three-piece suit and stuck it through the canvas of the abstract painting he had been working on. It was a revelatory moment that led to a 50-year painting practice in which the artist blended the dayglo palette of cartoons with imagery from fashion and advertising. Mixed into these sharp, graphic compositions were art historical references to Dalí, Mondrian, Joan Miró and others. In Stumped, a 1976 painting now in the Arts Council collection, two elegant female mannequins, dressed in blue shoulderless tops and peach skirts, are shown embracing. Undermining this pop art sensibility, each figure has one arm missing and no head. On the left breast of one figure a Dalí-like eye is placed, on the other figure a small, Mondrian-esque colour grid is placed just above the waist. The figures in this work were more clothed than most. More typical is the cheekiness of Blonde With Strategically Placed Cushion (1970) or Study for Joie de Vivre (1978). In the latter an Audrey Hepburn-type figure, hand and scalp missing, exposes her left breast through her blue, shoulder-padded top. To the right, in the background, stands a male figure, similarly amputated, and nude but for a blue posing pouch, pubic hair overflowing. For all he learned at art school, however, Fields’ real education, and fame, came from the fashionable milieu of late 60s and 70s London, where he was a regular at parties and fashion events, recognisable by his trademark quiff and penchant for eyebrow makeup. Friends and collaborators included Zandra Rhodes, Marc Bolan, John Maybury and Andrew Logan, at whose Alternative Miss World beauty pageant Fields was a dedicated attendee.    Clothing featuring art by Duggie Fields on sale at Dover Street Market in the West End of London. Photograph: Glenn Copus/Evening Standard/Rex/Shutterstock   Born in Salisbury, Wiltshire, to Edna (nee Rosenthal) and Henry Field, Douglas grew up in the garrison town of Tidworth, where his father owned a large pharmacy. He recalled being fascinated with the packaging that lined the shelves, and, stored out the back, in the room in which Henry ran a sideline putting down sick pets, a collection of old posters, featuring glamorous pin-ups hawking pharmaceutical drugs. “These were by far the glossiest, the sexiest, the most seductive” adverts he had ever seen, the artist recalled. The family moved to Hampshire in 1954 and the boy was educated at Andover grammar school. After the family moved once again, this time, to Borehamwood, in Hertfordshire, where Duggie attended the grammar school in Cowley Hill, he took advantage of his proximity to London to sneak into the capital, one of his cousins, Judy, taking him to a gay club called the Purple Pussycat on the Finchley Road, and the West End music venues then populating their bills with blues bands. One night, in a 50-person-capacity flea pit, he saw the Rolling Stones play. Their arty glamour immediately seduced him, and he abandoned plans of studying in Liverpool to move to London. Initially enrolling in an architecture course at the Regent Street Polytechnic, he was told that he would be better suited to Chelsea. It was sound advice – there he found the King’s Road to be a “parade of beautiful people”. “There were visions on the street; amazing people came,” he said. One such beauty was Syd Barrett, with whom Fields shared a flat in Earl’s Court from graduation in 1968, the year the Pink Floyd singer was ousted from the band. Already known for his dapper dress, Fields’ cult fashion status was confirmed when he was featured in Caterina Milinaire’s Cheap Chic (1975), an immediate bible of DIY fashion. When Barrett left for a reclusive life in Cambridge in 1972, Fields turned the pop star’s bedroom into an atelier, and stayed living in the same apartment until his death. The flat became a maximalist temple, a reflection of the all-encompassing nature of Fields’ artistic vision, captured by Derek Jarman in the filmmaker’s 1974 work At Home With Duggie Fields. Of his interest in fashion and design, Fields told Elephant Magazine last year: “I don’t see any separation between my art and life … I live inside a painting.” He recreated Gerrit Rietveld’s Red Blue Chair, only with oversized painter’s palettes attached to the legs; his own work was printed on cushions, with paintings leaning against the walls and fashion magazines piled in every room. “Less is less, more or less,” he was fond of saying. “It’s a concept I’ve slowly evolved all my life.” For an exhibition at the Modern Institute in Glasgow in 2018, the artist recreated his living quarters in the gallery. Among the objects on show was a cushion with Fields’ painting of Alex from A Clockwork Orange on, the original painting commissioned by the film’s director, Stanley Kubrick. It was one of many collaborations the artist embarked on. In 1983, sponsored by the cosmetics company Shiseido, Fields travelled to Tokyo to produce a show. Shiseido ran an extensive marketing campaign featuring his work, including self-portraits on television, billboard and subway advertising throughout the country. It made him hugely famous, and Fields would find himself mobbed on the street by teenage girls, the company’s target market. In 2002, his painting Party On was featured in Transport for London’s Platform for Art series. Five years later he walked the Paris runway for Comme des Garçons, having been muse for Rei Kawakubo’s collection that season; in 1987, kiss curl intact and bedecked in gold makeup, he played Avarice in the music video for the Pet Shop Boys’ It’s a Sin. Art critics were often sniffy, however. In one notorious 1987 review Brian Sewell wrote that Fields was “a painter of whom no one should take the slightest notice”, whose work was only of interest to the “homosexual mafia”. Later reviewers claimed a “whiff of casual misogyny” in the work. Before the Modern Institute show, Fields’ last solo exhibition was at the Gallery Liverpool in 2012. The artist’s institutional shows amounted to the Ikon Gallery, Birmingham (1980) and Spacex Gallery, Exeter (1982). From the 90s onwards Fields used his paintings to make digital animations, mostly shown on his personal website. The BFI showed them in 2016 as part of Flare, an LGBTIQ+ film festival. The artist was sanguine about this limited recognition, though. “I’ve never been in the art world per se,” he said. “I have always thought of myself as an outsider and not unhappily. I remember when I was a student, we weren’t supposed to want to be in museums or admire them. We were supposed to be anti-bourgeois and bohemian.” He is survived by his brother, Howard, and niece, Sara.   • Duggie Fields (Douglas Arthur Peter Field), artist, born 6 August 1945; died 7 March 2021\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'Have Meghan and Harry moved the monarchy closer towards its end? If only | Jonathan Freedland',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Will this be the moment? Will Meghan and Harry do to the monarchy what Diana threatened but never quite achieved, shaking the institution so severely it eventually collapses? Those who believe Britons should be able to choose their head of state have waited patiently for the crisis that finally undoes the House of Windsor, but this week they allowed themselves an excitement they had not known since the 1990s. Polling is stubbornly consistent, showing support for a republic flatlining at around 20%, but might the Oprah interview and all it revealed trigger a shift? Could this, at last, be it? The case for republican optimism begins with an acknowledgment that this latest twist is hardly unprecedented. On the contrary, each generation seems to have its own iteration of the same plotline, a tale of love and marriage revealing a cold, closed institution thwarting the happiness of its young. It was Edward and Mrs Simpson for my grandparents; Margaret and Group Captain Peter Townsend for my parents; Charles, Camilla and Diana for me – and now the Sussexes for my kids. The public splits on generational lines, the young shaking their fists at the palace as monarchists feel a tremor of fear, anxious that the public will finally turn on the institution and demand its abolition. Usually it comes to nothing but, says the republican optimist, this time is different. Harry and Meghan have introduced a new, radioactive element into the mix: race and racism. The coming generation will not tolerate that, just as they will not forgive the callous dismissal of a declared mental health problem. True, Diana made that latter complaint too, but attitudes to mental health have advanced since then. In this view, the Windsors have crossed two lines that, for younger Britons, must never be crossed – and that could destroy the public consent on which monarchy rests. The racism accusation is particularly lethal, because the conventional remedies are not available to royalty. They cannot promise to “prioritise diversity” or to ensure their personnel “better reflect Britain in 2021” because that’s not how a hereditary monarchy works. It allocates its – and therefore our – top job by bloodline. The role is reserved for the members of a single white Protestant family. You can’t “modernise” your way out of that ancient fact, one that contradicts everything we tell ourselves about our society. We like to speak of inclusivity, but forget that the role of head of state is determined by genetic exclusivity. Meghan could have represented an answer of sorts to that, bringing some diversity to the family. Instead, republicans can feel relieved that the monarchy had a chance to deepen its support among black and mixed-race Britons – and blew it. What’s more, the palace cannot comfort itself that this week was a one-off: the Sussex bombardment might well continue, with Netflix as the launching platform. Relevant too is the fact that the monarchy’s prize asset is a single, mortal individual. Malcolm Turnbull, the former Australian prime minister who led the unsuccessful 1999 referendum campaign to remove the Queen as that country’s head of state, told me this week of “the huge reservoir of respect and affection” that exists for the monarch and which has long blocked the path to change. That’s truer still in the UK, where Elizabeth serves as the last symbolic link to what is the foundational event of modern Britain – 1940, our finest hour – and meets a deep need for constancy and continuity, connecting the present to an almost unrecognisable past. But the Queen will be 95 next month; the second Elizabethan era will one day draw to a close. Her success has been predicated on a fastidious neutrality and the mystique of silence, two qualities that her eldest son will not be able to replicate: we know where he stands because he’s talked a lot. All of which allows republicans to expect a shift. And yet, even though I share their conviction that in a democracy we should elect our head of state, I’m not hopeful that a breakthrough is imminent. First, there’s the history. The Windsors have survived much greater challenges than an Oprah interview: Edward VIII abdicated and Diana ended up dead, the latter generating a wave of fury that engulfed the streets rather than Twitter. For the Mirror to call this week’s events the “worst royal crisis in 85 years” shows nothing so much as forgetfulness. Second, revelations of family dysfunction don’t undermine the monarchy so much as explain its enduring appeal. One of royalty’s advantages over electing an aged eminence as president, Ireland-style, is that it provides a rolling soap opera, a perpetual source of gossip, human drama and distraction. “It’s reality TV,” says Turnbull. The dysfunction is part of its function. Royal rifts and scandal are not a bug; they’re a feature. Which means republicans don’t win when they rest the case against monarchy on the flaws of those who currently inhabit it. Far better to make the case in principle. In Australia, that’s easy because the principle is so simple: Australia’s head of state should be Australian. The case here – that Britain can never be democratic or equal when the top rung of our national ladder is in the permanent grip of a single family – is also strong, but it can rapidly sound abstract or dry, lost in the arid wastelands of “constitutional reform”. This is the republican paradox: the exciting arguments don’t work, the powerful ones are boring. Some reformers believe their moment will come when the Queen’s reign ends. Once it’s no longer about her, people will be receptive to the republican argument. That forgets, though, that the system allows no such interval for debate on the merits of Charles III. It will be: “The Queen is dead, long live the King”. There’s a reason the monarchy has stood as long as it has. For all the Windsors’ glaring deficiencies, the odds remain stacked in their favour. Republicanism is a just cause – but, for now at least, it seems a lost one.  Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist \\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'People from poor UK areas more likely to be high-risk online gamblers - study',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'People in deprived areas are more likely to use online casinos and place risky long-odds bets, according to a study that found gambling firms make the vast majority of their money from the 5% of accounts that rack up the biggest losses. Researchers from the University of Liverpool and the National Centre for Social Research found that most gambling accounts lost relatively modest sums, but that firms make at least 70% of their revenues from the biggest losers. In sports betting, that proportion rises to 86%, with people in deprived areas more likely to go for longer-odds wagers with a lower prospect of success. Gamblers from the poorest areas were also more likely to lose money in online casinos, which the study found presented a particular risk of high-intensity play despite lower overall losses across all players. Nine out of ten online casino accounts either won money or lost less than £500 over the course of a year, but 164,000 lost more than £500 during a single session of play, and 47,000 people lost more than £5,000 in a year. This group was disproportionately likely to come from deprived areas and to have lost their money on virtual slot machines, which carry a higher rate of addiction than most other gambling products. Slots accounted for more than half of losses above £5,000 and 70% of sessions where someone played for three hours without a break. More than 14,000 accounts did this three times during the year, often at a rapid pace, although in practice this could have been a smaller number of people doing so more often, as the study could not factor in users holding various accounts. Three-quarters of slot accounts had “spun” the machines more than 30 times in a minute at some point. The maximum spin speed is set to be reduced to 24 times a minute. “This all reaffirms my thoughts that those most vulnerable are groomed and exploited by an industry entirely motivated by profit,” said the Labour MP Carolyn Harris, who chairs a cross-party group advocating gambling reform. “We saw it with the clustering of bookies in deprived areas, when the FOBTs were a huge money-maker,” she said. “We are seeing it now with online. How can we trust this industry to self-regulate when they have repeatedly shown themselves to be predatory and merciless in their pursuit of profit?” Campaigners for tighter affordability checks on gamblers said the study showed that such restrictions would not curb most people’s freedoms. Of accounts used to bet on sport, 85% lost less than £200, while 90% of gaming accounts either won money or lost less than £500 over the course of a year. “This confirms what we have known for a long time, that the vast majority of online gambling profits are coming from people losing more than they can afford,” said Matt Zarb-Cousin of the Campaign for Fairer Gambling. “Affordability checks introduced for losses equivalent to £100 a month would apply to fewer than 5% of gamblers.” The Betting & Gaming Council, the industry lobby group, said gambling firms had improved controls since the study was undertaken. “There is growing evidence that recent improvements in standards are now starting to have an impact,” it said.\\n',\n",

       "  'full_article': \"The Gambling Commission has suspended the operating licence of Football Index, the self-styled “stock market of football”, a few hours after the beleaguered betting company announced on Thursday that it had suspended “trading” on its platform.   Related: Football Index: customers' money trapped after platform is suspended   The Gambling Commission said in a statement on Friday morning that the operating licence of BetIndex Ltd, the Jersey-based parent company of Football Index, had been suspended following “an ongoing section 116 review into the operator, as we had concerns activities may have been carried out in purported reliance on the licence, but not in accordance with a condition of the licence, and that Football Index may not be suitable to carry on with licensed activities.” The statement added: “We have made it clear to the operator that as the investigation progresses, we expect it to focus on treating consumers fairly and keeping them fully informed of any developments which impact them.” For the moment, Football Index’s licence has been suspended rather than revoked pending the outcome of the Gambling Commission’s investigation. After a series of crashes in the overall value of its market since September 2020, however, most recently after an 80% cut in the “dividends” paid out when players performed well, it is difficult to see any way it can survive. Thousands of account holders with Football Index, who have staked tens of millions with the firm to buy what it described as “shares” in leading footballers, will now fear that their last hope of retrieving any money trapped in the platform has vanished.   Related: Anger grows as Football Index issued new shares in players days before major changes   It could be weeks or months before the scale of losses in Football Index becomes clear, but it seems certain to be the biggest failure that Britain’s regulated gambling industry has seen. Its model – seen by some customers as “safer” than betting with a traditional bookmaker – encouraged users to deposit and gamble large sums and then wait for dividend returns, in the expectation that they could also retrieve funds by selling their “shares” to other users should they so wish. The market’s liquidity evaporated during recent collapses, however, leaving money trapped in the market unless users accepted huge losses on their stakes. It now seems almost certain that all outstanding stakes - by one estimate, at least £60m – will be lost.

       "  'title': 'Police restraint contributed to Leon Briggs death, jury finds',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'The way in which police officers restrained a man with drug-induced psychosis “more than minimally” contributed to his death in Luton in 2013, an inquest jury in Milton Keynes has found by unanimous verdict. Leon Briggs, a 39-year-old father of two of mixed ethnic background, was a lorry driver and also taught computer skills to older people. His family described him as “a loving brother and father, caring and genuine”. He was detained under the Mental Health Act and taken to Luton police station on 4 November 2013. Briggs died about two hours later at Luton & Dunstable hospital as a result of “amphetamine intoxication in association with prone restraint and prolonged struggling”, with a secondary cause of heart disease, the senior coroner Emma Whitting has previously said. His family said the fact that the inquest, which began on 4 January 2021, had taken seven years to complete compounded their grief and distress over his loss. The 10 members of the jury were asked to consider findings of unlawful killing and neglect. They rejected unlawful killing and found neglect. Brigg’s mother, Margaret, said: “Seven and a half years ago, my life changed for ever when my son Leon was cruelly and brutally taken away. On this day his children lost a much-loved and devoted father. During this inquest we have heard evidence that has convinced me that Leon was unlawfully killed by the police. This should have been the conclusion today. “He committed no crime and yet he was restrained face down on the floor, with force used against him, and he was shackled. We think that Leon’s race was a factor in the way he was treated by the police. He was treated as someone who posed a threat rather than someone in need of help.”  The jury found “a series of omissions and failures” by Bedfordshire police and East of England ambulance service. The ambulance service acknowledged a series of failings before the jury began its deliberations, including a failure to assess Briggs, communication failures and a failure to recognise and treat Briggs as a medical emergency. The jury was asked to answer 40 questions, and in their answers they identified multiple failings. They found that the use of force on Briggs in the street, failure to recognise that he had become a medical emergency, failure to do a proper handover when Briggs arrived at Luton police station, failure to realise that he was not medically fit to be detained, and failure to monitor him appropriately more than minimally contributed to his death. It found that inappropriate weight or pressure was applied to Briggs. The jury also found that a psychostimulant-induced psychotic disorder and heart disease more than minimally contributed to Briggs’ death. They also found that police officers had believed it was necessary to use force on Briggs and that the use of force on Briggs in the circumstances was reasonable. The inquest heard evidence from Briggs’ mother about the deterioration in his mental health in the months and weeks before his death, and his family’s mounting concern about this. He had agreed to go to hospital to seek help on the day he died.    Margaret Briggs. Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo   On the day of his death, 4 November 2013, police were called after Briggs was witnessed behaving strangely, walking and skipping along the street, moving in and out of shops and weaving in and out of traffic. At about 2pm that day he was restrained on his front in a prone position in the street in Luton, at the junction of Marsh Road and Willow Way. His hands were handcuffed behind his back and his legs were tied with straps. Video footage does not clearly show this restraint. However, Briggs can be seen being carried face down into a police van.     A second piece of footage then shows him at the police station at about 2.25pm where he can be heard repeatedly screaming “no”. He is seen being placed face down in a police cell and the handcuffs and leg restraints are removed. Soon afterwards he falls silent. Police officers can be heard asking if he is all right. Three minutes later the cell door was opened and then an ambulance was called. He was taken to Luton & Dunstable hospital at about 3pm and pronounced dead at 4.14pm. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (now the Independent Office for Police Conduct, or IOPC) referred the case to the Crown Prosecution Service in March 2016 to consider manslaughter charges. In 2018 the CPS said no further action would be taken. In February 2020, Bedfordshire police were due to carry out a gross misconduct hearing against various officers involved in the incident. There were allegations that three police officers had breached professional standards concerning use of force and that five officers had breached standards relating to their duties and responsibilities. However, Bedfordshire police said they would not present any evidence against their officers, so the IOPC had to withdraw the directions of misconduct and the hearing did not go ahead. The deputy chief constable of Bedfordshire police, Trevor Rodenhurst, said: “The jury has today identified a number of significant failings by the police which contributed to the death of Mr Briggs, and for this we are truly sorry. “The attending officers chose to restrain him so he could be taken to a police custody suite, which was a recognised place of safety, where he could be properly assessed. By the time it became apparent he was a medical emergency it was too late to save him, despite their concerted efforts.” An East of England ambulance service spokesperson said they apologised for shortcomings in the medical assessment of Briggs. They said: “Much work has taken place since this sad case to better support and treat patients in a mental health crisis, including the introduction of a dedicated mental health street triage team in the area, and we will review and act on the coroner’s findings to ensure that any further lessons are learned.”  Anita Sharma, the head of casework at Inquest, who has worked closely with the family, said: “This damning conclusion is an important recognition of the seriousness of the system-wide failures. The police will say that seven years on, things have changed. Why then are black men still subject to disproportionate use of force by police? Why are they more likely to die after police contact, particularly when in a mental health crisis? And why have the police resisted scrutiny and accountability since his death by neglect?”\\n',\n",

Due for completion this summer, the situation room is an addition to the underground Cobra briefing rooms, a cramped suite of offices where politicians, military, spy and police chiefs can gather to make decisions in a crisis, ranging from a deadly terror attack to widespread flash-flooding. Politicians and advisers have long complained about Cobra’s supporting technology. “It’s certainly less glamorous than any Hollywood depiction. There’s the ability to project PowerPoints and you can video conference people in. But that technology doesn’t reliably work. It’s just not state of the art,” a former Downing St adviser said. Only one picture of a Cobra room exists, showing a windowless boardroom with three digital clocks and a large screen divided into eight.

He contrasted the Cobra room picture with Nasa’s vast mission control room and the one used for Cern’s Large Hadron Collider near Geneva. “Notice how poor it is compared to Nasa, the LHC etc? There has clearly been no attempt to learn from our best examples about how to use the room as a tool,” he wrote. Cummings left government abruptly in December, but such sentiments – that bigger screens, interactive maps and large data dashboards can act as a basis for improved decision making – are widespread at senior levels.    Nasa mission control. Photograph: Xinhua/Rex/Shutterstock   At one Cobra meeting during the Ebola crisis several years ago, when David Cameron was in power, it became impossible to hear from either the then foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, who was in Washington, or the UK’s ambassador on the ground. “Don’t worry,” Cameron quipped, according to one Whitehall veteran. “We’re making lots of great decisions anyway.” Former senior Whitehall insiders say that while the upgrade has been billed as being at the heart of Boris Johnson’s integrated review of defence and foreign policy, due out on Tuesday, in fact it dates back to decisions made under Theresa May. “This has been planned for years and been tacked on to the review,” the former official said. Donald Trump was able to watch the US raid on the compound of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi from the White House in 2019, although what was shown to him was overhead surveillance footage with no audio – prompting questions as to how the former president could claim the Isis leader had died “whimpering, crying and screaming all the way.” Ben Barry, a retired British army brigadier and senior fellow at the Institute of International Strategic Studies, said video was often a distraction. “Having a screen that shows drone footage leads to decision-makers in the room getting overly fixated on the footage, when you want them to sit back and think strategically.” In the US, special forces no longer supply helmet camera footage in real time to command centres, partly to prevent backseat driving. The UK maintains a distinction between in-principle decisions that are taken by politicians and operational decisions for military, police or other emergency services. Another question is how good is the information coming into a Cobra meeting, which often takes place when a situation is in flux, particularly during a terror attack. “In the early periods of a crisis, the problem is actually knowing reliably what is happening,” the former Downing Street adviser said. Part of the situation room upgrade is an enhanced team of “watchkeepers”, whose job it is to monitor, collate and, in a crisis, hand out information about what is happening, culled from a mixture of social media, news reports and other public and private data with the help of special monitoring algorithms. They create what is known as the Common Recognised Information Picture (CRIP), an agreed statement of facts, used partly to prevent politicians arguing needlessly about what is happening on the ground when key decisions have to be taken, usually in 45 minutes or less. Barry argued that this too is insufficient if ministers and officials do not engage in regular practice exercises, and if government fails to shift to crisis mode effectively in response to a slow-building crisis, such as an emerging pandemic. “Last March many parts of government failed to respond properly. A proper situation room may well be good thing, but it is a stool on one leg if ministers are not well drilled to act and government is not geared up to respond,” the former solider said.\\n',\n",

       "  'full_article': 'When Paul O’Connell says he will face the strongest Scotland team he has encountered as a player or coach on Sunday, in one sense it does not mean much. Ireland have won 17 of the 21 fixtures between the sides in the Six Nations era and only one of the defeats was by more than a score, but the observation of the former Lions captain reflects how the gap between the sides has narrowed to the point where it is not the visitors to Murrayfield who are the favourites on Sunday. Scotland should be going for the triple crown, having followed up their victory at Twickenham in the opening round by taking a 14-point first-half lead at home to Wales. They were accused of getting ahead of themselves as the Welsh rallied, but the turning point was Zander Fagerson’s red card 26 minutes from the end that left them vulnerable to the opportunism of their opponents.   Related: Wales seizing the moment with Italy unlikely to derail grand slam hopes   The week before, Ireland had lost to Wales having had Peter O’Mahony sent off in the opening quarter but led for long enough to be frustrated by the outcome. They were edged out by France a week later in their worst start to a Six Nations campaign and a romp in Rome did not provide redemption. Scotland have a more refined attacking game than Ireland and have hardened up at forward since the one-sided World Cup match between the sides in Yokohama in 2019, but one significant difference remains. Ireland have a core of players versed in the art of winning when they are expected to, the door Gregor Townsend’s players need to pass through to turn from one-off performers to contenders: defeat would mean Twickenham becomes another footnote. “You sometimes think if a coach is into attack, his teams won’t have a physical edge, but that was not the case when Gregor coached Glasgow nor is it with Scotland now,” said O’Connell, the Ireland forwards coach. “Much of the good attack in the autumn and in this tournament has come from Scotland, and they are very, very physical as well. I think it is the best Scotland team I have gone up against. They are in a very good place.” Scotland sat out the last round because of an outbreak of Covid-19 in the France squad so it is a month since their players who are based at home took the field. Townsend has made four changes from the side that lost to Wales, with Sean Maitland and Sam Johnson returning behind, while WP Nel replaces the suspended Fagerson in the front row and James Ritchie returns from injury to displace Blade Thomson. Andy Farrell has made three changes to his Ireland side from Rome, with Keith Earls, Cian Healy and Rob Herring returning, but the fit-again scrum-half Conor Murray makes only the bench as Jamison Gibson-Park continues to partner Johnny Sexton and inject a dose of unpredictability into a structured side. “We are well aware of the threats posed by an experienced Ireland squad and the players have prepared for a contest that will require one of their best performances,” said Townsend. “Every moment will count and we will have to be there for the full 80 minutes.”   The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.  Scotland should have had at least a draw in Dublin in last year’s Six Nations and started well there in the Autumn Nations Cup before being derailed by a yellow card. Assuming Wales defeat Italy in Rome, only the winner of the postponed match in Paris will be able to catch them. That is why this weekend is significant for Scotland, a team that need to find ways of winning matches rather than losing them. When Hogg lost the ball over the line in Dublin last year, it seemed to sum up the side, backing away when opportunity knocked. Time to deliver.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'Time running out for FTSE 100 firms to hit deadline to end all-white boardrooms',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Time is running out for FTSE 100 firms, including the British Airways owner IAG, BAE Systems and JD Sports to appoint at least one director of colour before a year-end deadline, after analysis showed nearly a fifth of the UK’s largest listed firms were led by all-white boardrooms. An update from the Parker review, a government-backed report into ethnic diversity in boardrooms of stock market-listed companies, showed that 81 FTSE 100 firms had now met the voluntary target for “one by 2021”, up from 52 last year. However, 19 companies, including the housebuilder Persimmon and the asset manager M&G have just nine months to meet the minimum standards set out by the review. Three of the 19 firms provided no data on their diversity levels, including Just Eat and the retailer Next. Karan Bilimoria, the president of the CBI and its first black and minority ethnic head, said: “This is an important milestone, but not job done. Companies need to keep up momentum with actions to improve ethnic diversity at every level, developing talented future leaders from across society. We need to see those last few firms do what the large majority have done already, and end the all-white boardroom.” The Parker review, which launched in 2017, gave FTSE 100 firms until the end of 2021 to appoint at least one non-white board-level director. The same target was set for the FTSE 250 companies, but with a deadline of 2024. While the Parker review committee praised the “significant progress” made by firms in the past 12 months during the pandemic, the total number of BAME directors holding top board positions was still strikingly low. People from BAME backgrounds hold just 124, or 12%, of the 998 director positions across the FTSE 100 index. That is up from 98, or 9.7%, of 1,011 positions last year. There are only five ethnic minority chief executives leading FTSE 100 firms, all of whom are men. They include Ivan Menezes of the alcohol firm Diageo, Octavio Alvídrez, head of the Mexican mining company Fresnillo, and Ivan Arriagada of Antofagasta. However, as Green Park, the diversity consultant and recruitment firm, revealed in February, there are no black executives in any of the FTSE 100’s top three executive positions. That is despite calls for greater representation of people from black backgrounds after the resurgence of the Black Lives Matter movement, sparked by the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police last year. The Parker review has not revealed the proportion of black representation in its own statistics, but Sir John Parker said the review would request that data from the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 in future.  Parker said a lot had changed since he appointed a BAME director to the board of Babcock more than 20 years ago, and brought Dipesh Shah on board as a non-executive in the late 1990s, but there was a lot more to do to improve gender and ethnic diversity. While businesses had become more “comfortable” with boardroom diversity, Parker said the next step was to ensure that more women and BAME candidates moved up the corporate ladder to fill executive roles.   Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk   However, he said, it was important to commend firms and headhunters for their efforts so far. “There’s been tremendous commitment.” Shareholders are also pressuring firms to make progress, given evidence that companies with more diverse boardrooms perform better than all-white, all-male ones. The Investment Association, which represents asset managers with more than £8.5tn under management, said it would “continue to engage with listed companies to understand how they plan to meet the Parker review targets”.

       "  'title': 'Low cost, high pressing: how Barnsley took the Championship by storm',\n",
       "  'full_article': \"“Holding your nerve is a very polite way of putting it,” says the Barnsley chief executive, Dane Murphy, breaking into laughter as he recalls this time last year when the club was propping up the Championship and seven points from safety. They stayed up on the final day courtesy of a stoppage-time winner at Brentford but the sequel to last season’s miraculous escape might yet trump that climax. With 11 games to go, sixth belongs to Barnsley, a forward-thinking, data-driven club with a low-cost, high-pressing formula. Barnsley’s style has revolved around suffocating and sapping opponents for a few years but, nine months ago, the landscape looked markedly different. “There was not a lot of sleep,” says Murphy. “The goal scored by Clarke Oduor to keep us in the division changes the stars. That really galvanised everyone involved because it proved that yes, we took a lot of risks last season by starting the youngest team in the division and having the lowest budget, and we struggled at times, mightily. But we have been able to give them time to grow into the group you see now and this is the reward.”   Related: 'We've surprised ourselves': Paunovic puts top flight in Reading's sights | Ben Fisher   Faith in a Moneyball-like model is yielding results at Barnsley, where Billy Beane, who transformed Oakland Athletics’ trajectory with the use of statistical analysis, is a shareholder. They have won seven of their past eight matches and are unbeaten in 10 before visiting Bournemouth on Saturday. Fans have not clunked through Oakwell’s turnstiles for 12 months but might they return to the terraces supporting a Premier League club? Valérien Ismaël, who took charge of the club in October when Barnsley had three points from their first six matches, affords himself a wry smile. “We have three games until the international break and after we will see a clear picture in the table and maybe we will see what’s going on for us, if we can push for more or if it was a nice trip,” Ismael says. “We deserve to be here, we don’t have any big pressure and must stay hungry. We want to continue to move forward to finish this great season as high as we can.”    At 26, Cauley Woodrow is one of Barnsley’s oldest players. Photograph: Malcolm Bryce/ProSports/Shutterstock   Barnsley have a “soft cap” on signing players over the age of 24 (at 26, top scorer Cauley Woodrow was the oldest player in their starting lineup in midweek) and target undervalued players from the lower leagues and across Europe who can develop into assets. Metrics such as PPDA (passes per defensive action) detail the intensity with which a team defends and can help recruit players accustomed to Barnsley’s gegenpressing philosophy. “If we look at a player who is extremely talented, and his goals and assists are through the roof but he is not able to sustain an element of pressing and defending high up the field for 90 minutes, that is a red flag for us,” says Murphy. “There are lots of clubs that use data and have brought in analysts to push in this direction ... but at Barnsley it’s the principle, it’s the root of what we are doing. There are clubs that say, ‘We need to bring it in as an ingredient’ but here it is the bedrock. Like Brentford in a way and Red Bull on a global scale, data is the first thing that wipes out the noise for us.” There are perhaps more parallels between the Red Bull franchise, which owns clubs in Austria, Brazil, Germany, and the United States, and Barnsley’s royal redbrick facade and the wooden seats of the West Stand than at first glance. This week the Chinese-American billionaire Chien Lee, whose Pacific Media Group consortium bought Barnsley in 2017, added the Danish club Esbjerg to its stable of clubs, which includes Oostende, who are flying high in the Belgian First Division after finishing second-bottom last season, and Nancy, who have made strides in Ligue 2 since the takeover in January. Both are run day to day by Gauthier Ganaye, the former Barnsley chief executive. “It is on a smaller scale than Red Bull, but the idea and the intent of the ownership group was to create this ecosystem where each club is run with this financial model and recruitment model,” Murphy says. “Red Bull as a global club, and a global brand, their approach has been unique on several fronts and to try and emulate what they are doing, on and off the field, would only make sense. Brentford have set the standard in the Championship with how they are able to, on a smaller budget and with fewer resources than some competitors, steadily climb by finding talent that is undervalued and underused, and move those pieces on and bring new ones in.” Barnsley are at pains to avoid talk of the P-words – promotion and the Premier League – but are quick to spy potential, with Callum Styles, who joined from Bury as an 18-year-old after scouts tracked him in League Two, a prime example. Styles has flourished in midfield and at left wing-back and, on the opposite flank, Callum Brittain has shone since signing from MK Dons in October.    Callum Styles of Barnsley against QPR in February. Photograph: Simon Dael/BPI/Shutterstock   In January, Liam Kitching followed Ethan Pinnock, now of Brentford, in signing from Forest Green, while Conor Chaplin, a nippy striker, was identified while breaking through at Portsmouth before signing from Coventry. Not every signing is a triumph but the pathway is clear. “They have a track record of pushing young players into the first team and that appealed,” says Styles. “It was the right decision in terms of not getting lost as a youngster.” On Wednesday, Ismaël again played his party trick: a triple change before the hour mark to replenish his attack as if a Formula One car refuelling. “Exactly,” says the Frenchman, who has made more substitutions (139) than any other team this season. “My concern is: how can I keep the intensity high throughout the 90 minutes? That is why I was very delighted that we would have five substitutes [this season] because the front three are very important to our philosophy.”   The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.  Barnsley’s use of data has been accelerated since Beane came on board but the approach was the baby of the late former owner Patrick Cryne, whose son, James, owns a minority stake and heads the club’s recruitment operation. Incredibly, in a division awash with overspend, the club’s record signing remains the £1.5m they paid for Georgi Hristov in 1997. “We face teams week in, week out that have eight, nine, maybe sometimes 15 times the budget of what we are working with,” says Murphy. “I think that is another reason why we have to stick to our true north in the path that we are on with the data because if we go outside the lane and say: ‘OK, with this one player we are going to go beyond our means,’ then the dam breaks. We are bearing the fruit of our philosophy and, hopefully, that can continue.”\\n\",\n",

       "  'full_article': 'Amazon will no longer sell books that frame gay, lesbian, transgender and other sexual identities as a mental illness. The company made the announcement public in a letter sent to Republican senators who had asked why Amazon had stopped selling When Harry Became Sally: Responding to the Transgender Moment, a book by the conservative academic Ryan Anderson, best known for his opposition to same-sex marriage.   Related: Amazon bans sale of most editions of Adolf Hitler’s Mein Kampf   In the letter, first obtained by the Wall Street Journal, Amazon writes: “As a bookseller, we provide our customers with access to a variety of viewpoints, including books that some customers may find objectionable. “That said, we reserve the right not to sell certain content. All retailers make decisions about what selection they choose to offer, as do we. As to your specific question about When Harry Became Sally, we have chosen not to sell books that frame LGBTQ+ identity as a mental illness.” The letter came in response to criticism from the rightwing senators Marco Rubio, Mike Lee, Mike Braun and Josh Hawley who wrote to the Amazon founder, Jeff Bezos, criticizing the book’s removal and calling it a signal “to conservative Americans that their views are not welcome on its platforms”. The move will have a significant impact on books that frame LGTBQ+ identities as mental illnesses. Amazon accounts for 53% of all books sold in the US and 80% of all ebooks, according to Codex Group, a book audience research firm. The decision comes at a moment when Republicans and the conservative movement are increasingly focused on so-called “cancel culture”. Republicans have recently criticized the decision by Dr Seuss publisher to stop publishing six of his books because they portrayed people of color “in ways that are hurtful and wrong”. “Everyone agrees that gender dysphoria is a serious condition that causes great suffering,” Anderson and Roger Kimball, publisher of Encounter Books, which published the book, said in a statement given to the Journal. “There is a debate, however, which Amazon is seeking to shut down, about how best to treat patients who experience gender dysphoria,” they added. “Amazon is using its massive power to distort the marketplace of ideas and is deceiving its own customers in the process,” they said. A spokesperson for LGBTQ advocacy group GLAAD said: “There’s an antiquated and shameful history of equating LGBTQ identity to mental illness, and Amazon’s decision to stop selling books that falsely equate the two is a positive step in ending the misinformation campaign against LGBTQ people, especially trans youth, meant only to cause harm.  “This book is dangerous and harmful to trans kids, and those who are looking for information about trans identity should not look to resources written by someone who has made their livelihood by publishing screeds against the trans community.”\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'Non-fungible tokens are revolutionising the art world –\\xa0and art theft',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'When the virtual auction bell rang at Christie’s on Thursday, Mike Winkelmann, a digital artist better known as Beeple, made history: he had sold a “non-fungible token” representing his piece Everydays: The First 5,000 Days, for $69.4m. But while the new cryptocurrency craze may have brought the high-end art market into the 21st century, it’s also modernising another aspect of the industry: art thieves. At their simplest, non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, can be thought of as “bitcoin for art”. Just as bitcoin created the ability to spend and save a sort of digital money without any centralised authority, so too do NFTs allow for pictures, videos, music, or anything else that can be digitally represented, to be wrapped up in a format that can be traded, stored or authenticated without needing to turn to a gatekeeper.     Once an NFT is created, it can be digitally traced for ever. And unlike a simple image file, for instance, an NFT can’t be duplicated, giving it a similar cachet to an original artwork, and enabling the sort of transactions that have seen the field garner mainstream interest over the last month. But while the very technology of NFTs prevents them from being duplicated without permission, there’s nothing inherent to the sector that controls who can make an NFT in the first place – a fact that has caused dismay to some artists, who have found their work ending up in the “control” of people who had nothing to do with its creation. Simon Stålenhag, the Swedish illustrator whose Tales from the Loop has become an Amazon Prime original, is one. On Wednesday, he found that one of his artworks had been turned into a “MarbleCard”, a type of NFT that allows users to make and trade tokens representing web pages. “I guess we must do a daily google if we’ve been NFT:d from now on,” he said. “Thanks Silicon Valley!” MarbleCard isn’t the only NFT service that makes it trivial to “tokenise” other people’s content. Another, Tokenized Tweets, lets users turn any tweet into a tradable digital asset simply by sending a message on the social network, and artworks posted to the site have been a popular target for tokenisation. “Now people can sell your tweets all without your permission,” warned the artist RJ Palmer, whose own images were tokenised without his permission. Emma Price, an artist and designer based in Margate, cited Palmer’s experience, as well as the enormous environmental damage of the cryptocurrency sector, in taking a stand against NFTs. “Very quickly it became clear that a lot of non-creative, often faceless, entities were jumping in to exploit all manner of ways to create and distribute NFTs, with little care afforded to an originator’s ownership of a digital item. “There’s no oversight here, and seemingly no understanding of or respect for copyright. The unscrupulous way that it allows artists to be ripped off is maddening.” While NFT systems that encourage users to tokenise web pages or tweets they do not own were always likely to invite trouble, even more conventional systems that allow for artists to tokenise their own works have caused controversy. The Wu Tang Clan’s foray into the area last week was aborted after the artist Kevin Alexander objected that the animation was similar to an artwork he had posted online in 2013. Sometimes, the boundary blurring is deliberate, as with the Burned Banksy NFT. This token, which sold for around £300,000, is an image of a Banksy print titled Morons, which was sold in an edition of 500. But the specific print that has been tokenised, number 325, was publicly burned as the token was minted, a move the anonymous creators argue “moved the value of the physical piece on to the NFT”.    The burning of the Banksy print Morons. Photograph: Burnt Banksy   Even for those digital artists who view 20th-century copyright norms as outdated, though, the trend is raising concern. “In a sense, the NFT sector should be more attentive to what is offending and upsetting people – especially the artists whose work is attracting interest to their field – than strictly what is technically or legally possible,” says Parker Higgins, a New-York-based artist and activist who has campaigned for copyright reform. “In many other creative areas, norms and customs are more influential than the specific contours of copyright law, where the price of transgression is not necessarily a lawsuit but still very real. Sure, people in the NFT space can choose to ‘move fast and break things’ through those considerations, but they risk coming across as antisocial weirdos that nobody wants to associate with.”\\n',\n",

       "  'full_article': 'It is funny how the wheel turns. Once upon a time it was France who were les grandes énigmes; now it is red rose supporters who are shrugging with palms upturned and wondering which England team will turn up. It is a long time since Les Bleus arrived at Twickenham with a better balanced lineup or, more ominously still, one with such clear potential for further improvement. Maybe their hosts will be roused into action and extend France’s dismal Six Nations record across the Channel since the topsy-turvy day in 2005 when, from 17-6 down at half-time, Dimitri Yachvili’s boot secured an unlikely 18-17 victory. Rather more likely is that France – recent Covid-19 disruption permitting – will underline the widening gap between the teams in terms of front foot confidence and genuine attacking elan.   Related: Max Malins handed a belated chance to shine for England in Six Nations   A glorious repeat of 1991, when France launched one of the most daring raids seen at Twickenham from behind their own posts to set up Philippe Saint-André’s famous try at the other end, is asking too much but, 30 years on, the intoxicating scent of Gallic ambition hangs in the air again. Not since Thomas Castaignède twinkled so brightly outside Philippe Carbonneau in the brilliant 51-0 grand slam demolition of Wales at Wembley in 1998 have two French half-backs headed to London for a championship fixture accompanied by such high expectations. Everyone already knows about Antoine Dupont, dubbed the “mini Jonah Lomu” by the former French hooker Benjamin Kayser this week. The Toulouse scrum-half, still only 24, has it all: the strength, the daring, the acceleration and, increasingly, the presence that comes with being recognised as the best No 9 in the world. Slightly less attention, for now, has been paid to Dupont’s outrider, Matthieu Jalibert. By the time the 2023 World Cup comes around, the Bordeaux-Bègles fly-half could also be the most influential 10 on the planet. Listen, for example, to this assessment from Jalibert’s one-time Bordeaux head coach, Rory Teague, who was also England’s skills coach under Eddie Jones in 2017. “You’ve got a very interesting player there,” says Teague, who remains in touch with his former charge. “There were elements of his mental resilience that reminded me of Owen Farrell: he’s very tenacious, very driven and demanding of high standards. Yet he also has that French flair, that bit of stardust you don’t often see. His change of speed, his ability to scan a defence, see a gap early and exploit it is pretty impressive. It’s great to see how he’s evolving.” Jalibert, 22, also seems to have timed his arrival on the international scene just right. Look around the world and running fly-halves are increasingly back in vogue, as noted by the Scotland coach, Gregor Townsend. “I see fly-halves who are runners being more effective in the game than ever before,” Townsend told BBC 5 live, citing Beauden Barrett and Richie Mo’unga in New Zealand and Scotland’s own Finn Russell. “These are players who attack the line. At stand-off you’ve got the first opportunity to take on the defence. The more you pass the ball, the more a good defence might close you down but if you’ve got that running instinct it’s going to serve you much better than maybe it did five or 10 years ago.” With the gifted Romain Ntamack back from injury on the bench, Virimi Vakatawa restored to the midfield and Gaël Fickou adding more understated class and defensive organisation, it makes for an intriguing contrast with England’s more conservative selectorial approach and stilted attacking efforts in the tournament to date. A shortage of ball and a spiralling penalty count has clearly done them no favours but generally England’s first instinct has been to kick first and think afterwards.    France’s Antoine Dupont (right), in action against Italy last month, has been called a ‘mini Jonah Lomu’ by the former French hooker Benjamin Kayser. Photograph: Insidefoto/LightRocket/Getty Images   Harsh on George Ford and Owen Farrell, perhaps, but France appear to be much further down the boulevard towards coaching’s holy grail: a team capable of making massive dents up front, the set-piece included, threatening around the rucks as well as out wide and of kicking smartly out of hand. “The French do like to play on instinct and are probably less pragmatic, but that side of their game is developing,” cautions Teague, who also worked with Dupont’s understudy Baptiste Serin during his time in Bordeaux. “They like to keep the ball alive and play to space; taking the ball into contact and going to the floor is not their first thought. It’s more: ‘How can I manipulate a defender, can I take him on and keep the ball alive?’” With Shaun Edwards having also instilled more organisational steel, Charles Ollivon’s leadership style proving popular and Brice Dulin usually safe and secure beneath the high ball, it adds up to a mighty challenge for an England side who squeaked home – slightly fortuitously – in sudden death extra time when they met a weakened French team in the final of the Autumn Nations Cup in December. With the same referee, Andrew Brace, in charge again, the 14 penalties England conceded in Cardiff will doubtless ensure the official monitors the hosts more closely at the breakdown this time. It is England’s belief, nevertheless, that they can easily cut out the handful of silly penalties that cost them against Wales and Jones is in no hurry to sit back and coo at the exciting runners heading England’s way. “You guys like to talk about attack all the time but we know that Test rugby is won by defence. If our defence is right that will feed opportunities for our attack.”   The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.  The problem with that pragmatic analysis is that France, admittedly having played one game fewer, have conceded just two tries to England’s seven so far. It is easy to see Luke Cowan-Dickie bringing close-range intent and bristle while Maro Itoje has a point to prove but England will also require Kyle Sinckler at tighthead and Billy Vunipola at No 8 to underline their Lions-quality credentials. In short, Jones’s side will need to deliver comfortably their best performance of the tournament to halt France’s push towards a first Six Nations title since 2010. “We’ve always known France are a sleeping giant of world rugby but now they’ve woken up,” says Teague. Next time anyone jokes about which French team will turn up, the answer is self evident. A very good one.\\n',\n",

In Breton artist Xavier Marabout’s Hergé-Hopper mashupsTintin is variously painted into Hopper’s Road and Houses, scratching his head as he greets a woman in a car; looking disgruntled in a version of Hopper’s Cape Cod Evening, 1939; and kissing a girl in a car, in a spin on Hopper’s Queensborough Bridge, 1913. On his website, Marabout describes his work as “strip art”, in which he “strips distant artistic universes to merge them together” in a style where “parody [is] omnipresent”. But the Moulinsart company, which manages the Tintin business, disagrees, accusing Marabout of reproducing the world of Tintin without proper consent. “Taking advantage of the reputation of a character to immerse him in an erotic universe has nothing to do with humour,” a lawyer for the company said in court in Rennes this week, where Moulinsart has sued for infringement, as reported by Ouest-France. Hergé, the lawyer added, had “explained his choice not to involve women in his work, because he found that they are rarely comic elements”. The Belgian artist included scarcely any female characters in the Tintin comics; in Benoît Peeters’ biography Hergé, Son of Tintin, he was quoted as saying: “I love women too much to make caricatures out of them! And besides, pretty or not, women are rarely comic elements … Is it that the maternal side of women doesn’t lend itself to laughter? It is indeed strange to realise that women are absent from many comic-strip stories. Or if they are there, they are rarely funny.” In response, Marabout’s lawyer claimed the paintings were parody, reported Ouest-France, and cited a “conflict between copyright and freedom of expression and creation”, asking: “Does an artist have the right to wonder about Tintin’s sex life?” and “what about artistic freedom?” The Rennes court will rule in May. Marabout told the Guardian that his work echoed the historian Christian Jacob’s belief that “there is no cultural transmission without reappropriation”. “This is exactly what that I do in my work as an artist. I revisit my own culture by merging, or mashing up, different cultural worlds, and giving them meaning. Because some universes speak to each other in secret,” he said. As well as Hergé and Hopper, his fusions include Batman and Klimt, Picasso and the creations of cartoonist Tex Avery. “In my Hergé Hopper series, I imagined a romantic life for Tintin in the intimate and voyeuristic universe of the American painter. Because frankly, the universe of Hergé is terribly virile and women are completely absent,” Marabout said. “Who can imagine a world without women? So my paintings where Tintin is staged with pin-ups are funny, but behind that I wanted to show that the two universes were perfect to meet. The mystery of Hopper paintings responding to the Tintin mystery.” “I defend my right to parody which is part of freedom of expression,” he added. “It is a fundamental law in our democracy. I hope that justice will prove me right, but I am still worried, because we are going through a difficult period where freedoms are declining every day.” Moulinsart did not respond to a request for comment from the Guardian.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': \"Sarah Everard's case stirs awful memories. So little has changed over the years | Catherine Mayer\",\n",
       "  'full_article': \"Years ago, on an early morning furred with frost, something caught my attention as I passed the local churchyard: a mannequin sprawled on a gravestone. It took a moment for me to realise what I was seeing, a body, naked from the waist down. The police took a statement. This should have been the extent of my involvement. I couldn’t identify the murder victim or add any other useful detail. Nevertheless, during the following week an officer dropped by my flat several times unannounced to “update me on the case”. On his last visit, he showed me a card he’d made for a colleague as a joke, a post-mortem headshot of the victim with helmet and moustache added, transforming the dead woman, he said, into the spitting image of his boss. As horror robbed me of speech, he asked me out on a date. I thought about that encounter after the gut-punch news about Sarah Everard’s disappearance, and that a suspect, Wayne Couzens, an officer of the Metropolitan police, was being held for questioning about her kidnap and killing. I thought about it when I read of the “reassurance patrols” deployed in the area from which Everard was snatched, the visible presence of Couzens’ colleagues supposed, somehow, to make women feel safer. Should the Met be investigating or investigated? This question gained urgency with reports that the force faces an inquiry into whether it properly looked into the claim that Couzens had exposed himself at a restaurant, days before Everard’s disappearance. I thought about it when the Today programme responded to the outpouring of rage and sorrow for Everard by booking an interview with a criminologist called Prof Marian FitzGerald. Many women had taken to social media with their own stories of assault and intimidation. The broadcaster Shelagh Fogarty, for example, tweeted a list of bad things that had happened to her, starting with a man following her home from school when she was 10 and culminating four decades later with a stalker terrorising her for three years.   Related: Family of Sarah Everard pay tribute to 'bright and beautiful' woman   FitzGerald’s response to similar testimonies, some of which were read at the beginning of the segment, was dismissive: “Perhaps I’m entitled to say as a woman we should not pander to stereotypes and get hysterical,” she said. She advised “the sort of precautions I’ve always taken walking about London late at night, knowing where to walk, where not to walk, how to hold yourself” and rounded off her appearance with the observation that the risk to women “hasn’t changed in a long time”. This last point was true, but not in the way she meant it. The reason I cannot shake the memory of a police officer’s unwanted attentions and grotesque misuse of a victim’s image is precisely because so little has changed in the intervening years. Back then, in my 20s, I assumed progress just happened without us doing anything to prod it along. Equality shimmered on the near horizon. I understood violence purely as an interaction between individuals rather than grasping its systemic and cultural dimensions and the ways in which the institutions that should combat it too often harbour and enable it. Learning about these dimensions came at a personal cost that underscores my activism and helped propel Sandi Toksvig and me into creating the Women’s Equality party in 2015. Yes, there are psychopaths, born not socially constructed, but even rotten apples take their cues from their surroundings, with studies suggesting that the behaviours of male psychopaths may differ from female psychopaths along gendered lines dictated by their upbringing and environment. Violence is rarely random, despite the frequency with which this phrase appears. Its targets are predetermined by hatreds that are learned, not inherent. The ordinary everyday sexism I knew in my youth, the routine sexualisation and dehumanisation of women, hasn’t gone away, any more than have the other ideologies that start from the idea that some humans are worth less than others. On the contrary, these things have found amplifying channels and platforms online and are enjoying a terrible resurgence. The Crown Prosecution Service is currently evaluating charges against two Met police officers accused of taking selfies in front of the bodies of murdered sisters Nicole Smallman and Bibaa Henry, then sharing those images on WhatsApp. These days women still walk home with keys threaded through anxious knuckles, only to switch on their computers to find death and rape threats. We are supposed to shrug these things off, treat them as normal, rather than normalised. Well I’m not prepared to do so. Plans for distanced vigils and protests and the continuing tidal wave of personal testimonies suggest that many, many others feel as I do. This is in the face of opposition from the Metropolitan police, which is banning the Reclaim These Streets vigil planned on Clapham Common on Saturday night despite the organisers’ care to ensure adherence to Covid safety. I joined more than 200 women, MPs, party colleagues, charity workers and others to sign a letter pushing for action to tackle violence against women and girls. And such action is long overdue. Women are leading the calls, but it is way past time that men stepped up to the plate. We can best honour the victims of violence not only by demanding their assailants face justice, but by challenging the systems and cultures that enable violence and pin the blame on victims. I’m looking at Westminster with its failure to tackle its own culture of abusive behaviour – its own 2018 investigation found that one in five people working there had suffered harassment. I’m looking at the media, reflexively denying its own culpability while pumping out stories that diminish, divide and dehumanise. And I’m looking at those tasked with protecting us. I’m remembering a winter morning and all these years later, I still feel the cold.  Catherine Mayer is an author and co-founder of the Women’s Equality party  \\n\",\n",

       "  'full_article': 'When is an album not an album? Why, when it’s a “non-fungible token”, a new form of digital swag, related to cryptocurrency, being sold by artists and musicians such as Kings of Leon and Grimes. They’re called NFTs for short, but why? Perhaps disappointingly, “fungible” does not mean “capable of being turned into fungi”. Rather, the Latin verb fungi means to discharge some office or perform some task, and so fungibilis means “useful”, and English “fungible” specifically describes useful things that are interchangeable. If I order five spoons of a certain design, it doesn’t matter exactly which five of those spoons you send me. The OED says the word was first used in English by the diplomat Anthony Ascham in 1649, though the citation it gives is actually, according to Early English Books Online, from a 1676 treatise on maritime law, De Jure Maritimo et Navali, by Charles Molloy and Robert White. Of money, they write: “Take away this fungible Instrument from the service of our necessities, and how shall we exercise our Charity?” Money is the paradigmatically fungible good, since one £10 note is as good as any other. Writers, though, are definitely not fungible. • Steven Poole’s A Word for Every Day of the Year is published by Quercus.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'I’ve been with my girlfriend for six months. Is it too soon to have a child?',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Since I started dating my girlfriend six months ago, I’ve had this feeling that something just fits, in a way I’ve never felt before. In past relationships I’ve had periods of insecurity and mismatches in energy or expectations. Here, so far, there has been none of that. The few misunderstandings we’ve had have been worked out in a way that left us feeling better than before. There’s a lot of warmth and affection; we trust and respect each other, and the sex is very good. I don’t feel like anything is missing. Sometimes, I suppose a bit more passion or excitement could be nice, but I attribute some of this to the stress of pandemic times. Given our healthy sex life, I’m not hung up on it. Here’s the issue: I’ve always imagined dating someone for at least two years before considering next steps (marriage, children). Both of us are on the same page about wanting these things one day. When I first met my girlfriend, she had come to terms with the possibility of not having children biologically, as she is nearing 40. I should mention that I am 30, also a woman, and would like to have children biologically if I can, though presumably I have more time. However, as we have become closer, she has made a few comments suggesting she would like the experience of having a child biologically, if possible. I am sure she would never pressure me about it. Of course, I can’t make this decision entirely on my own, but my question is: if the gut feeling is good, if the relationship feels right, is it worth jumping in? Should we take the steps to have a child together this early on in our relationship? Or at least, propose the option? It seems you have a really good feeling about this relationship, but it’s great you are being so thoughtful, because this is about having children and that deserves contemplation. I consulted relationship psychotherapist Jo Coker (cosrt.org). She thought your relationship sounded “really refreshing, really attuned” and there were lots of good signs, not least being able to work on things together, and finding a positive solution for both of you when things have gone wrong. But we both wondered where the idea of waiting for two years comes from, and whether you could challenge this? “Is it,” asked Coker, “something you’ve seen in peer groups, or in your parental history? What have you seen magically happen after two years?” “Sometimes, when we are younger,” explains Coker, “it can take longer to reach the established stage.” As we grow older, and know ourselves better, we can often reach this stage sooner. “A relationship,” says Coker, who has sat in with many couples over her 20 years as a therapist, “doesn’t have to be long term to be good… relationships tend to be as good as the day they’re on.” Perhaps your girlfriend had shelved the idea of motherhood until you came along, and something about the solidity and promise of your relationship has allowed her to look at the prospect anew. You also say you’d like a child, so these are all things you need to talk about. “Your relationship,” says Coker, “is functioning well and is solid in terms of your communication skills. The bit that needs consideration is whether you agree about how the pregnancy would happen. Who has the baby, and what impact would it have on your relationship at this stage?”   Related: My relationship is not quite perfect: if we get married, is it doomed?   To my mind, this is where your energies need to go next: the logistics and practicalities of having a baby. It’s often only when we talk about how we feel and what we want, and see other’s reactions, that we acknowledge those feelings ourselves. And of course, it’s the only way to find out whether you’re on the same page in terms of outcome and timing. You both seem able to talk very well, which is a very big plus point. Can you talk to others who have gone through a similar journey? Which bits did they find challenging? What many new parents find tricky is working out not only how physical tasks are shared, but also who carries the emotional load. You talk about jumping in, which sounds reckless, but you don’t seem reckless. Jumping in with a bit of thought and knowledge sounds sensible.

       "  'title': \"'No 10 was a plague pit': how Covid brought Westminster to its knees\",\n",
       "  'full_article': \"Westminster is an infectious place. A tiny germ of controversy or rebellion can spread across parliament, through Whitehall and into the prime minister’s office within hours. The windowless offices are cramped, MPs sit elbow to elbow in a Commons chamber that can only squeeze just over 400 MPs into its seats, two-thirds of the number in parliament. It is also a place of macho presenteeism, where the Greggs in Westminster tube station often serves as a nightly dinner spot for some of the most senior office-holders in the land. This was the situation when Covid-19 arrived in the UK. The Guardian has spoken to a number of people who were there at the time. They revealed that the virus spread far more widely than has been reported, and spoke about the sense of panic across Whitehall as Covid threatened to paralyse government.    A member of staff sticks a poster of a rainbow on a window at 10 Downing Street last April, while Boris Johnson was in hospital with coronavirus. Photograph: Tolga Akmen/AFP via Getty Images   Horrified staff and ministers, dealing with the worst crisis in decades, had to reckon with how the country could be run when everyone in charge was getting ill. Famously, Boris Johnson, Matt Hancock and Dominic Cummings contracted the virus. So did England’s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, and the then cabinet secretary, Mark Sedwill. Ministers and their staff had it. Almost all the staff in Downing Street, too. It spread to special advisers across Whitehall and to parliamentary lobby journalists. Although the Palace of Westminster escaped any mass outbreaks among staff, several MPs caught Covid. Many in the office of the Labour leader, including Seumas Milne, had it. Jeremy Corbyn may have had it, although he was never tested and so has never been sure.   Related: How Covid spread through Westminster's corridors of power – timeline   But the situation was at its worst at the heart of Downing Street. For a number of days aides looked almost entirely to the then director of communications, Lee Cain, for direction. “No 10 was a plague pit,” one adviser recalls. “No one outside the postcode quite knows how bad it got in there.” Another said: “Lee was running the country, genuinely, for quite some time.” According to many of those present, almost the entire staff team in Downing Street caught Covid-19 at some point during those weeks, with James Slack, the prime minister’s spokesperson, a notable exception. “You’d got to a meeting expecting to see someone important and they were gone – and you knew why,” another adviser said. “It started off more surreal than scary, but it became very scary once the PM was so ill.” There are fewer workplaces less suited to social distancing than Westminster. High security means much business is conducted in person. MPs vote in packed and sweaty corridors. Staffers share desks. Most windows can only be heaved open a crack with brute force. Downing Street is far from opulent when compared with the palaces of most heads of state. Staff use small entrances and corridors with flaking paint and decorated only with laminated health and safety notices. In the weeks leading up to lockdown, staff acknowledge there was no social distancing to speak of, only jokes about how to most respectfully sing God Save the Queen while hand-washing. Staffers working in political and civil service roles during that time, who spoke on condition of anonymity as some are still in post, admit the pandemic took time to appear on the radar of a government preoccupied with a great election victory, Brexit and, closer to home, a purge of special advisers under Cummings’ iron fist. There were concerns, but there was also a lightheartedness. One aide held a birthday party for fellow Tories and served Corona beer. Johnson was sufficiently unconcerned to miss five Cobra meetings in January and February. It seems clear the UK was deeply unprepared for the pandemic – from out-of-date PPE to delayed preparedness training – while contingency planning was diverted to a no-deal Brexit. Lindsay Hoyle, the newly elected Speaker of the House of Commons, said the whole of government did not see until quite late the extent to which Covid-19 would radically alter everyone’s lives. “I don’t think we got a picture [for a while] for how big of scale this was, or how it was going to affect the house. Like everybody else, we were underestimating how bad it was going to be. I’ll be very open, very honest about that. It was lack of understanding of what we were facing.” One of the few people still working in a high-profile job in Westminster who had experience of tackling a pandemic was the shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth. “I was actually in Downing Street for swine flu 10 years ago,” the Labour MP said. “I remember when I first heard of the virus in Wuhan I thought: I wonder if that’s going to be like swine flu. But I obviously didn’t appreciate at that point it would be off the scale.”    Johnson hosts a panel event and reception to mark International Women’s Day on 5 March 2020, an event that Nadine Dorries also attended. Photograph: Reuters   Ashworth asked for his first briefing with Whitty in January 2020. By February he was doing “nothing else” but studying the trajectory of the virus, he said. But it was when the health minister Nadine Dorries was confirmed to have Covid on 10 March that the magnitude of the crisis fully dawned on some of those in government.  “The moment we realised this is probably more widespread in the country than we thought is when Nadine Dorries tested positive,” one health official said. At the time, people were only meant to get tested if they had been to one of the affected areas. “So the original assumption was, she hasn’t been to Italy or China so she hasn’t got Covid, even if she’s got some symptoms. And then she tested positive and I remember thinking: hang on, is this thing spreading much more widely than the people realise?” On 11 March, the day after Dorries tested positive, Liverpool played Atlético Madrid in front of a crowd of tens of thousands at Anfield. It was also the day of Rishi Sunak’s first budget.     Pats on the back for the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, after delivering his budget in the House of Commons on 11 March. Photograph: UK Parliament/Jessica Taylor/PA   “Footage in the House of Commons for Rishi Sunak’s budget showed Tories slapping him on the back. It was a terrible look,” said Ashworth, who started advising staff to stay at home the week before lockdown. “[The government] should not have been doing that. I think there was definitely a feeling of British exceptionalism in Downing Street.” Many of those at the heart of the story who caught the virus admit they were slow to realise how fast it was spreading. One special adviser recalled starting to experience symptoms in the middle of a meeting with a national newspaper’s political editor.    Lee Cain, second right, and Dominic Cummings, right, at a news conference inside 10 Downing Street on 12 March 2020. Photograph: Simon Dawson/PA   “Everyone was getting ill, it was quite striking how obvious it was,” one senior Labour official said. “It felt like a cold,” said another senior party official. “And you wouldn’t normally go home because you had a slight cough. But then I was eating something and it tasted like metal. And the inside of my nose felt weird. And that’s when I realised.” One political journalist who started feeling ill described being gripped by horror later in the afternoon when they remembered that the MP they had met earlier for coffee had breezily announced she was off to a meeting with her entire parliamentary party – and wondered how many they might have unwittingly infected. “It was so different because it directly affected everyone, I got so many calls from journalists or MPs asking for personal advice, what happens if I’ve had dinner here or I’ve met this person, or if I’ve been to see my 80-year-old mother,” one health official said.

Photograph: Reuters   On 16 March, Johnson convened a meeting with Corbyn, Ashworth and staffers including Cummings and Milne, as well as Whitty, in Downing Street. It was intended to shore up Labour support for the coronavirus bill, introduced three days later. “Everyone was crowded around one desk,” one observer said. “It was insane if you think about it.” The Labour group argued forcefully for more economic intervention, given the spontaneous lockdown many people in the country were already beginning to observe. Two sources in the room said Johnson agreed with Corbyn and Ashworth that some form of full national lockdown would be inevitable. The meeting was cordial; Milne and Johnson even shared a joke about their time as journalists. The meeting’s significance might have been passed over had it not been for what followed.  Milne told friends he came down with a temperature that night – and was subsequently featured on the front page of the Mail on Sunday as the man who might have given the virus to the prime minister. Sources close to Corbyn said the then Labour leader also had some cold-like symptoms. Ashworth, who was also in the room, did not catch it. No one can say for sure who spread Covid to whom, because the virus was already rampant in Westminster. That evening Johnson advised people to avoid all unnecessary contact and travel and to stay away from pubs and theatres    Matt Hancock watches Boris Johnson speaking during prime minister’s questions on 25 March. Photograph: House of Commons/PA   On Wednesday 18 March, PMQs was quieter than usual but MPs still dribbled into the chamber. Sunak and Hancock, the health secretary, sat close to Johnson on the frontbench. Corbyn, despite being over 70, attended in person, with his spokesperson saying the government advice on shielding was still not clear. On the Friday evening, Johnson said pubs and restaurants should close and Sunak announced a furlough scheme. On Monday 23 March, in a ministerial broadcast from Downing Street, Johnson ordered the entire nation to stay at home.     The first indication that officials outside Downing Street had that something was wrong with Johnson was a quiet inquiry by a No 10 special adviser to speak with Whitty on Wednesday. The chief medical officer advised the prime minister to get a test, which came back positive. Hancock began experiencing symptoms on 26 March, and rang his staff to say he had a temperature and was getting tested, prompting panic in the department about how to handle the media frenzy they anticipated should they have to announce the health secretary was ill with coronavirus. But within hours the prime minister tested positive, and that was the story.    Matt Hancock making the announcement that he has tested positive for coronavirus via Twitter. Photograph: @MattHancock/PA   Johnson’s office realised in horror that one key person he might have infected was Hoyle, who has type 1 diabetes. “I got a phone call immediately. They were very worried about me, because the footage on the television was Boris six inches away speaking to me. And Hancock had also done the same in the same week,” Hoyle said. “I was very lucky, I didn’t get infected, but nobody could have got closer to either of them. I don’t believe it was caught in the house. Far from it. My worry was about them bringing it into the house.” Many of those staffers who fell ill like dominoes over the coming days tried to keep working. Hancock was isolating when he got a positive test but carried on issuing directions from home. “If anything he was almost more manic,” one official said. Another senior party insider said they and many others just worked through the virus, taking short naps in between calls. “Even though I was ill, I’d worked every day from home for a week and I just used to get very tired in the afternoon and go to bed for two hours. And then I kept on working.” “So much was happening by video and you could not always tell if people were at home because they were ill,” one aide said, describing it as “like playing wink murder” to spot who was trying to struggle through, or who was missing. Whitty was forced into self-isolation by Johnson’s diagnosis, as were many other staffers. Cummings, Johnson’s all-seeing chief of staff, departed London for Durham with his young family, his wife already sick and knowing he was likely to develop the illness. In the week after Johnson was diagnosed, it was not taken too seriously by staff, or the prime minister himself. He worked in isolation in Downing Street and would thump himself on the chest and say “strong as a bull!” and aides would laugh. But it was quietly becoming evident it was taking him a long time to shake off the virus.    Boris Johnson chairing a remote session with his cabinet while self-isolating on 31 March 2020.

Johnson was working in a small office connected by a stairwell to his No 11 flat next to another used by his private secretary and senior aides, who would toss paperwork and media scripts through the open door.  Johnson chaired cabinet on 28 March by video link, “coughing and spluttering his way through conference calls”, according to sources, which leaked into newspapers. Public questions were starting to be asked about the prime minister’s condition. On Friday 3 April it was clear that Johnson’s symptoms were lingering and aides took a video in which an unkempt and clearly struggling prime minister said he “still has one of the symptoms, a minor symptom, I still have a temperature”.     The video was recorded on Johnson’s phone and took multiple different takes to record because he was coughing so much. Aides had to keep politely finding different ways to say: “I’m not sure we’ve quite nailed that there, boss.” Even then, Johnson was joking about trying to look well on camera and “uplift the nation”. Many felt at the time – and more now do in hindsight – that more should have been done that week to persuade him to rest. Advisers were getting worried. Discreet preparations were being made that week for Johnson’s admission to St Thomas’ hospital, should it be necessary. The Guardian got wind of this but it was denied by officials. By Sunday, it was necessary. Johnson phoned his senior staff before he left for hospital confirming Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, should take charge in his absence. Cummings was also out of the picture, ill in Durham. “It wasn’t actually scary – personally scary – until the PM almost died,” one senior official said. “From that moment you go from it being just a manic effort to get everything done to the consequences of it all hitting you so hard.” There was still a persistent attempt, outwardly, to pretend Johnson remained in charge. At the daily press briefing on Monday 6 April, Raab kept repeating that the prime minister was in “good spirits”. In fact, neither was true. That night Johnson was moved to ICU. He had told the nation he hoped to turn the tide in 12 weeks and that restrictions would be reviewed in three weeks. In that third week, he was in intensive care.

Photograph: Pippa Fowles/Crown Copyright/10 Downing Street/PA   The symbolism was not lost on many working closely with him. Johnson’s private secretary, Martin Reynolds, phoned Downing Street and said there was a “50/50” chance the prime minister would be put on a ventilator. If this had happened, his chances of survival would have plummeted. Sedwill was in charge of drawing up a plan for succession if Johnson died – approved by the prime minister himself. No 10 at that point was like “a ghost ship”, as one aide put it. Cummings was in Durham, Cain was on his last day of self-isolation. “Lee came in like a bullet the next day,” one colleague recalls. “There was a meeting he turned up to with Raab, Sedwill and other civil servants and he was like: ‘Hello, I’m back, I’m in charge of the politics now.’” The political staff in No 10, particularly those with a background in Conservative internecine politics, were also starting to think about the nightmare scenario of the death of the prime minister. “You knew the party would have forced some awful leadership election, it would have been carnage,” one said. “It was about confronting the utter horror of that – in a pandemic – and feeling pretty overwhelmed with emotion, too.” Representing one of the flaws of the British political system, Downing Street resembles the court of a medieval king. What matters is the prime minister, and who matters are those who have the ear of the prime minister. Advisers fall in and out of favour and only a few are known to be directly speaking for the prime minister – those who can therefore be taken seriously. When the prime minister is suddenly absent, the system no longer works. “There’s a gap, like physically, in the building, and there was a bit of a gap politically,” one former adviser said. “The two main characters – Johnson and Cummings – were absent,” one No 10 insider said. “When the court doesn’t have a king, it’s just a massive vacuum,” another former staffer said. “The only reason senior people had authority is because they spoke with his voice. So when you remove him, it becomes very, very difficult to keep that authority.” “Boris in particular, his presence is really felt, he takes up space,” another ex-staffer said. “And the other person who had that presence was Dom. And he was gone as well.” “That week was hell,” another official said. “There were all these meetings where it was never completely clear who was driving things or in charge. Who was actually going to be there if you had a meeting?” Those who recovered were desperate to get back into work. “I remember saying I have to be there, I’m going mad at home,” a Whitehall source said. At the time, civil servants were ordered to work from home but many in No 10 wanted to be in the building. Cain told them they could come in if they wanted and he would take the flak. “Lee did end up running the country for about two weeks, I’d say,” one adviser said. “There was no one else any sort of senior level who had any sort of authority on behalf of the PM to be doing stuff or making decisions.” Ministers’ aides were buddied up and told to get to grips with a different department so they could shadow each other if another fell sick. Cain had been at the prime minister’s side for years, through his time at Vote Leave, to the Foreign Office, to his time on the backbenches and through his leadership campaign. Even more than Cummings, Cain was seen by people in Whitehall as speaking with his boss’s voice. “It was a bit like a very long marriage,” one close friend said.    Dominic Raab, centre, arrives at 10 Downing Street on 7 April. Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA   Raab, the “designated survivor”, as he was nicknamed, took charge of the day-to-day business as part of a quad of ministers with Sunak, Hancock and Michael Gove. Hancock was often the target in those meetings as the government struggled with PPE shortages, deep concerns over ventilator capacity and what many felt were wildly optimistic promises by the health secretary on testing. Raab felt his role was to be a stabilising force, one aide said. “He was a good manager, he didn’t push his own agenda. It was just a holding position. But he didn’t step up in the way Rishi stepped up. You’d hardly say it was a moment for Dom Raab.” Others described Raab’s understated attitude to the role as a strength. “He had a lot of big jostling egos to manage in the cabinet and he managed it,” an aide said. A senior Downing Street source said it was like “chalk and cheese” working with Raab versus working with Johnson. The prime minister would hand out jobs from his red box, happy to delegate – “a bit more loosey-goosey” as one insider put it. Raab was extremely strict with protocol and insisted everything went through Cain.     In the prime minister’s absence, battle lines were also starting to be drawn between those who believed opening the economy was imperative and those who believed a long lockdown was necessary. Cummings spent much of his isolation reading about the Spanish flu pandemic and told advisers after he returned that he had been convinced of the need for tougher measures and slower reopenings. There was some political calculation at play as well: Cain and the Tory adviser Isaac Levido believed the party would be annihilated at the next election if there was a catastrophic death toll, whereas voters would be more forgiving of economic turmoil. Among those in favour of “running in hot”, which one characterised as “trying to allow desperate business owners to salvage their livelihoods”, were Sunak and the prime minister’s chief of staff, Edward Lister, who was shielding at home for much of the period. Newspapers were constantly briefed about the rows between “doves and hawks”. Gove was someone who “jumped from one camp to the other”, one adviser said, though in latter months he has been a more predictable voice of caution, alongside Hancock. In those early weeks, it was drily observed in Whitehall that Gove always seemed to be characterised as a hawk, whatever his position.    Media wait outside 10 Downing Street on 9 April 2020. Photograph: Peter Summers/Getty Images   No 10 and Whitehall were beset by leaks during that period, on the very biggest issues. “It’s fucking Zoom,” a special adviser said. “You’d log on to a sensitive meeting and you think it’s going to be five key people and then you’re like, hang on, why are there 80 people here and who the hell are they? We may as well broadcast this thing live to the world.” The daily 9.15am call between Raab, Sunak, Gove and Hancock would constantly leak. “Rish just got to the point where he wouldn’t even say anything in the meeting,” one insider said. With Johnson temporarily out of the picture, political aides suggested there were some attempts by ministers or civil servants to quietly discard unpopular issues. An adviser recalls a suggestion that a legal signoff connected with HS2 was needed – and that it be delayed until the prime minister’s return. “One of the first things the PM said when he got back was: ‘I can’t believe they tried to delay HS2 while I was in the ICU.’” “People really pushed their luck during that time – cabinet ministers, civil servants,” a senior aide said. “People delivered statements for approval by No 10 just 10 minutes before they were supposed to deliver them at the press conference and we had to be like: hang the fuck on!” All the actions of staff during that period are likely to be the subject of a public inquiry – perhaps the most important undertaking in living memory. Many believe the mistakes that were made were not a direct result of the way the virus ripped through the heart of Westminster and hobbled the operations of the government, but predictable consequences of a decade of deliberate policy. “I wasn’t in government. So I don’t know the extent that people being off ill hindered the decision-making on a day-to-day basis,” Ashworth said. “But the reason our response has been so disappointing and why we’ve been so exposed is because of decisions made over many years. The absolute scandal about the way in which we allowed the virus to rip through social care, not giving their staff sick pay, which meant that staff had to go to work. “We’ve built an economy which is characterised by zero-hours contracts, temporary work. These are all a reflection of the type of economy that the Tories have built over the last 10 years.”    Boris Johnson records an Easter Sunday video message at No 10 after his release from hospital. Photograph: Getty Images   Johnson returned to Downing Street on 12 April to a team that felt “overwhelmed with relief”, according to one staffer. He went to recuperate with his pregnant fiancee, Carrie Symonds, who was also recovering from the virus. But any reprieve would be very short-lived. The day he returned was the same day Cummings set out for his drive to Barnard Castle.\\n\",\n",

       "  'title': 'Wales to ease Covid lockdown restrictions from Saturday',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Some semblance of normal life will resume in Wales after the first minister, Mark Drakeford, announced a change from the “stay home” restrictions to more lenient “stay local” requirements. From Saturday, four people from two households will be able to meet outdoors to socialise, including in gardens. Outdoor sports facilities including basketball courts, tennis courts and golf courses can reopen, and indoor care home visits will restart for single designated visitors. The relaxation of rules will allow people from rural areas to travel greater distances than those who live in urban towns and cities. Hairdressers and barbers can reopen for appointments from Monday, the same day that all primary school pupils and those in qualification years can return to schools.      Drakeford was accused of a U-turn, however, after he announced that non-essential retail would remain closed until 12 April. The Welsh government had earlier suggested in a preview of the announcement that such retailers would start to reopen gradually from 22 March, the same date as restrictions would be lifted on items that could be sold in shops that are currently open. Businesses said the Welsh government had left them with “the impression of being marched to the top of the hill, only to be asked to walk back down again”, while the Welsh Conservatives claimed the move was a “U-turn” and Plaid Cymru accused Drakeford of offering “false hope”. Speaking on Friday afternoon, Drakeford defended the plans. “It is safer to do it with shops that are open already because they are already having to comply with all the strict standards that we strengthened in the regulations we passed in the Senedd in January,” he said.    “So we know that these are safe places to visit and I know that environmental health officers of local authorities will be visiting those settings in the coming week to make sure that they are ready to continue to operate in that way after 22 March.” Drakeford said the retail sector had said it needed time to reopen safely, to return staff from furlough and to demonstrate shops could comply with standards in Wales. He added: “I was also anxious about opening non-essential retail in the full sense here in Wales while no shops at all for non-essential purposes are open in England because that acts as a perverse incentive for people to travel across the border. That would be to break the rules in England and to break the rules in Wales but you don’t want to create the conditions in which it is more tempting for people to do that.”\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'Labour suggests ministers failed to do analysis of Brexit deal',\n",
       "  'full_article': \"Emily Thornberry has accused the government of failing to carry out an economic impact assessment of Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal, after two key government departments told the shadow international trade secretary they had no such document. As official figures showed a 40.7% decline in exports to the EU in January, Thornberry wrote to the international trade secretary, Liz Truss, to ask why she had published assessments of many much less significant deals but not the crucial Christmas Eve trade agreement with the EU.   Related: Exports to EU plunge by £5.6bn in first month since Brexit   When Thornberry challenged Truss in the House of Commons to produce economic analysis of the deal in January, the minister referred her to the EU taskforce in the Cabinet Office, which spearheaded the fraught negotiations. But when Thornberry made a freedom of information request to the Cabinet Office, she was referred to the Treasury, which replied that it “does not hold a specific document meeting the terms of your request”. Johnson’s spokesperson had previously said the government would not be publishing its analysis of the economic impacts of the deal, but Thornberry has now written to Truss to ask whether the government failed to carry out an analysis at all. “It appears not that the government is refusing to publish the economic impact assessment it has conducted in relation to the UK-EU deal, but that no economic impact assessment was ever produced,” she said in a letter seen by the Guardian. “For an agreement of such immense importance for our country’s economy, business, jobs and trade, that is utterly staggering. And when we compare it to the approach taken to the assessment of every other UK trade deal signed over the last two years, it makes no sense whatsoever.” She gave the example of the department’s recent publication of analysis of the deal struck with Albania, a country with which trade was worth £45m in 2019. Trade with the EU is worth 15,000 times as much.   Related: Massive drop in UK trade shows extent of Boris Johnson's Brexit own goal   Labour has begun to take a more aggressive approach to highlighting the shortcomings of Johnson’s Brexit deal and the impact on businesses in recent weeks. Keir Starmer whipped his MPs to vote for the deal in December, saying Labour wanted to avert a no-deal exit and that it would still criticise the agreement. But he has made few mentions since of the impact of the end of the transition period on businesses. David Frost, who negotiated the deal and now sits in cabinet as the minister for EU relations, sought to play down the significance of January’s sharp decline in exports, pointing out that many companies had stockpiled goods before the end of the transition period. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility has warned that short-term trade disruption is likely to knock 0.5% off GDP in the first quarter of this year. A government spokesperson said: “Our deal with the EU represents one of the most comprehensive free trade agreements ever signed, and it’s a good deal for British families, businesses and jobs.” Officials claim it would be impossible for any single model or forecast to capture the complex impact of the agreement on the economy.\\n\",\n",

       "  'full_article': \"Migrants in northern Morocco said they had been forced to sleep out in the open after repeated raids by police, who allegedly burned down their shelters in camps near the Spanish enclave Melilla. Those camped along the border said Moroccan forces returned for a fourth day on Friday despite having already torched most of their tents. This week’s raids began after more than 150 migrants attempted to scale the fence between Morocco and the Spanish enclave on Monday. According to Spanish authorities, 59 succeeded in their attempt to enter EU territory.  map  A video sent to Alarm Phone, a support group for migrants in distress while trying to cross into European countries, appears to show the charred remains of migrants’ tents and scattered belongings. “They were burning and destroying people’s belongings, both the tent-like structures they construct but also their personal belongings. People were really cold and distressed and slept rough because they didn’t have anything else to construct with,” said an Alarm Phone researcher. They said the repeated early morning raids had put migrants on edge, fearing they will be picked up for detention while sleeping. They said dozens of women and children were sent to the south of the country in order to get them away from the border, while more than 100 men have been detained.   Related: 'I won't go back': why Libyans are joining the boats leaving their shores   The raids “come in waves … often as a reaction when a group has entered Spain,” they said. The Nador section of the Moroccan Association of Human Rights has repeatedly criticised authorities for arresting migrants from sub-Saharan Africa in the streets of Nador and transporting them to the southern borders, where they can be kept in detention or deported. Earlier in March, four people died within 30 hours attempting to swim to Melilla from a nearby Moroccan port, Spanish newspaper Okdiario reported. There are about 2,000 migrants hiding from authorities throughout the forests near Nador, according to Moroccan media, hoping to reach Europe either by jumping the fence into Melilla or by taking a boat across the Mediterranean.\\n\",\n",

       "  'full_article': 'Sam Smith, the pop singer whose gender identity is non-binary, has been excluded from the gendered categories at the 2021 Brit awards. The awards system has maintained its usual artist categories, with prizes for British solo male and British solo female. That means there is no room for Smith, who uses they and them as their pronouns since coming out as non-binary in September 2019. They said at the time: “After a lifetime of being at war with my gender I’ve decided to embrace myself for who I am, inside and out.”   Related: Griff, Pa Salieu and Rina Sawayama nominated for Brits Rising Star    Their album Love Goes is eligible for the British album of the year award. It reached No 2 in the UK chart on release in October 2020, and remained in the Top 40 until last week. In a statement on Instagram, Smith said: “The Brits have been an important part of my career … Music for me has always been about unification not division. I look forward to a time where awards shows can be reflective of the society we live in. Let’s celebrate everybody, regardless of gender, race, age, ability, sexuality and class.” A Brit awards spokesperson later responded, saying: “Sam is an extraordinary British artist and we agree with what they have said today. The Brits are committed to evolving the show and the gendered categories are very much under review. But any changes made to be more inclusive need to be just that - if a change unintentionally leads to less inclusion then it risks being counterproductive to diversity and equality. We need to consult more widely before changes are made to make sure we get it right.”  Earlier, in a message to Academy voters, organisers said: “Looking to the future we still have a lot of work to do in the coming years to evolve the Brits.” Smith is one of the most successful British pop artists of the last decade. Their 2014 debut album, In the Lonely Hour, went to No 1 in the UK and spent 69 consecutive weeks in the Top 10; its 2017 follow-up The Thrill of It All also reached No 1. Smith has had seven UK No 1 singles including those guesting with other artists, and won an Oscar in 2016 for the James Bond theme Writing’s on the Wall. They have previously won three Brit awards, from 12 nominations: the critics’ choice (now rising star) award in 2014, and British breakthrough act and the global success award in 2015. Prior to coming out as non-binary, they were nominated twice for British male solo artist, in 2015 and 2019. The awards have made changes to the eligibility criteria this year, allowing non-British citizens to be nominated in British categories providing they have been a permanent resident for more than five years. The change means that pop singer Rina Sawayama, who holds Japanese citizenship but has lived in the UK for more than 25 years, is eligible, and has been nominated for the rising star award alongside rapper Pa Salieu and pop singer Griff. She was deemed ineligible for the 2020 Mercury prize on citizenship grounds, a decision she described as “very upsetting”. The Mercury prize has also now updated its eligibility criteria to match that of the Brits. This year’s Brit awards ceremony will be held on 11 May, having been postponed from its usual month of February by the coronavirus pandemic.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'Soas students call for director to resign over use of N-word',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Students at Soas University of London have called for its director to resign after a meeting where he used the N-word in response to a question about lecturers using the term in class. In a meeting on Thursday afternoon between students and Adam Habib – a recording of which has been seen by the Guardian – a student asked: “How can Soas issue statements about Black Lives Matter while … allowing lecturers to say the N-word in class?” In response, Habib, saying the word aloud, said: “The issue around that is, I personally on the n****r, somebody making that allegation, then just bring it to me, I don’t know the case.” One student interjected and said it was not acceptable for Habib to use the word. They said: “It’s been used by lecturers and, historically, has been ignored when students have raised it, and now you have just used it in a public meeting with students. “Like many students have been saying, I find it unacceptable myself that you have used that word in a meeting. Absolutely unacceptable.” Another student added: “I’m sorry but you are not a black man, you can’t use that word.” In response, Habib, who is originally from South Africa and has been the director of the university since the new year, defended his use of the word by saying: “You do [find it unacceptable], I don’t actually. I come from a part of the world where we actually do use the word.” Habib then said, in response to a black student saying he shouldn’t use the word: “I’m sorry I offended you. I come from a part of the world when somebody uses it, the context matters. What I was trying to simply say is that if you find it offensive I’m sorry.” After the meeting, discussions among parts of the student community raised the issue of Habib potentially resigning after his comments. Habib posted a series of messages on Twitter in which he reiterated he had apologised and said: “The question is: why is it that after this apology, some are still politicising the issue?” He added: “So why don’t I think it was problematic to use the word when I did. Well, because context matters and I was arguing for taking punitive action. You cannot impute maligned intention without understanding context. Do I believe that only blacks can verbalise the word. No, I don’t. “I am aware that this is a common view among activists committed to an identitarian politics. I don’t identify with this political tradition. I grew up in a political tradition that is more cosmopolitan oriented and more focused on the class dimensions of structural problems.” Hisham Pryce-Parchment, the student union’s anti-racism officer who was present at the meeting, said many students posted on social media afterwards saying Habib should resign, and that an apology would not be enough. “He doesn’t actually grasp, and seems incapable of grasping the violence of the words, particularly for black students,” he said. “The whole thing was shocking from start to finish.” He added: “I know that many black students quit the call and didn’t wait for the end of it when he said that. I don’t think he can just apologise and we can be like: ‘OK, let’s move on.’” The student union issued a statement saying that what happened at the meeting was “unacceptable, disgusting and to be unequivocally rejected”. It is also considering what steps it should take, with one option being to launch a university-wide referendum on whether Habib should be removed as director. Sabrina Shah, the co-president for democracy and education at the student union, said that after students had expressed discomfort and challenged Habib on saying the word aloud, he doubled down. “After being challenged on using that word and explicitly being told it is unacceptable, and rather than retracting it and understanding and recognising the harm that was caused, he doubled down and said that it is acceptable to be using those terms.” Yasmin Elsouda, the co-president for welfare and campaigns, reiterated how students felt shocked by the incident. “I think that his comments were extremely harmful. So obviously him answering that question in that way and saying that word is absolutely shocking.” Habib told the Guardian: “A student did indeed pose a question that Soas was not responsive to anti-black racism and suggested that a staff member who used the word is still on the payroll. I did indeed use the word and said the following: ‘If someone used the word against another staff member, then it would violate our policy and the case should be brought to my attention.’ I also said that this is the first that I had heard of the incident. “I then did apologise saying that no offence was intended, and I again said that if the word was used by a staff against another human being, then it would be a disciplinary offence as it would violate our policies. “I am not sure why I should resign. No malevolent intention was behind my mention of the word. If anything, it was the opposite: a commitment to act if the word was used against another human being by anyone within our institutional community.”\\n',\n",

       "  'full_article': \"Wales have reached the stage of the Six Nations where for most of the years since 2007 they have been at their most effective. Vulnerable early on, as players struggle to take the significant step up from regional rugby, they become transformed by the time spent together and Italy in Rome should prove no more than a worn speed bump as they aim for a fifth grand slam in 16 years. Not that Wales admit to talking about the grand slam, doffing caps to a team that has lost its last 30 matches in the Six Nations and has not mustered a losing bonus point for the last three years. “Italy are a good team at home, so we know it is going to be tough,” said the full-back, Liam Williams. It is what the players are told to say, a guard against complacency, but even during a period when unusual results are not the exception they were, any team with the pretensions to be champions should be talking themselves up rather than opponents who reckon they are eight years away from being competitive.   Related: The Breakdown | France's return to scene of 2019 rout finds England in need of change   Not wanting to tempt fate is one thing, but even a fool in a hurry would not mistake Italy for a good team, at home or anywhere else. They have their moments, but with their foundations built on quicksand, they are unable to sustain pressure in terms of territory and possession and all too quickly get that sinking feeling. They have a spray of potential and they are missing the injured back-rower Jake Polledri, but even with two of their fixtures so far this year against sides who had not previously won a match, England and Ireland, they have not gone beyond 50 minutes before surrendering the bonus point. Only England have beaten Wales at this stage of the Six Nations in the last 10 years and if the leaders have enjoyed the fortune which jilted them in 2020, they have made the most of it. Although the bulk of the side was part of the successful years under Warren Gatland, they have become more nuanced under his successor, Wayne Pivac. A team that became adept at siege tactics has discovered the art of guerilla warfare, picking off opponents and prospering despite not dominating possession.    Wayne Pivac (centre) has made Wales a more nuanced side since taking over from Warren Gatland. Photograph: Ben Evans/Huw Evans/Shutterstock   What they have retained is the conditioning that enables them to play hard to the end, exemplified by their captain, Alun Wyn Jones, who continues to defy time and the battering his body has taken over 15 years of international rugby. It looked in the autumn as if Wales needed even more than their leader as they slumped to defeats against Scotland, Ireland and England and some of their experienced hardcore looked as if they had reached the Dad’s Army phase of their careers. Pivac needed results this year with a break clause in his contract at the end of it, and rather than invest in the future he coaxed more out of the likes of George North and Jonathan Davies by playing them out of position: the former at 13 and the latter at inside-centre. “It brings a bit of life back into boys who have been there a long time,” said the head coach, who looked as if he was not so much running out of road but had taken the wrong one when results meant he moved on his defence coach Byron Hayward last November.   The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.  Just as Wales were not as poor as their position suggested then, neither are they now the best around. They have captured the moment and, praise be, they are focusing on this Six Nations rather than a World Cup which is more than two years away. The oldest squad in the tournament may need an overhaul, but not in a rush if Pivac can coax more out of players who thought they had experienced it all. And they have Louis Rees-Zammit on the wing, a latterday JJ Williams who did not sleep for two days after the victory over England in the last round having been denied a try by the bounce of the ball. He will have opportunities to atone in Rome but it is Paris the following weekend when Wales’s fate will be determined and they have yet to lose a grand slam encounter in the Six Nations era.\\n\",\n",

       "  'title': 'Why are male politicians in love with topless vaccine selfies? | Priya Elan',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Are you man enough for a vaxxie (that’s a vaccination selfie to you and me)? That’s the question some of us are asking after having seen a host of politicians pose shirtless while getting their Covid-19 jabs. Not since Vladimir Putin shared those topless holiday pics, perfecting the butterfly stroke and breaking actual twigs with the simple power of his legs, have there been such strangely intimate insights into those who rule over us. There are rules to the vaxxie: you must have Viking-level chest hair, you must let your shirt hang like Morrissey in his first appearance on Top of The Pops, and you must cut a straight to camera look that suggests Dr Ross-era George Clooney. The twinkle in your eyes should make clear that you are absolutely not going to wince when that needle comes near you.    Johnny Mercer gets his Covid vaccine. ‘The look in the nurse’s eyes can only be read as utter glee.’ Photograph: Twitter   In January, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, the prime minister of Greece, showed us how to do it with the gritted determination of Kirk Douglas in Spartacus. Masked up and wearing a silver pendant that he surely picked up in Camden Market in 1993, Mitsotakis had a casually opened baby-blue work shirt which revealed an unapologetic garden of chest hair – and upper body that has clearly seen the HITT benefits of whoever the Greek Joe Wicks is. Vaccinations as domain of the Alpha heart-throb was not a pivot we could have imagined, even in the depths of our own corona’d-out fug. But it wasn’t just Mitsotakis, other politicians have been blue-steeling it too. The Conservative MP Johnny Mercer, who looks like a video of Giles Coren being played backwards, had a vaxxie that was as slick as Mitsotakis’s (although the look in the nurse’s eyes can only be read as utter glee at administering something sharp into the arm of someone who tweets things like: “We tried with the shirt on but I simply couldn’t get the sleeves over my muscles”). While Dr Dan Poulter, another Tory MP, revealed a hairy torso and sported a pose that could double as an 8x10 headshot for the reboot of ITV’s Gladiators. We’ve had variations too: Zdravko Marić, the minister of finance in Croatia, had his in a ridiculously tight white T-shirt, which was a not-so-humble body brag, while Olivier Véran, France’s health minister, coyly pulled his white shirt over his left breast while he was having his, like some office Christmas party version of Botticelli’s The Birth of Venus.    ‘Olivier Véran coyly pulled his white shirt over his left breast, like some office Christmas party version of Botticelli’s The Birth of Venus.’ Photograph: Jeanne Accorsini/DICOM/SIPA/REX/Shutterstock   By baring their naked humanity, the politicians behind these vaxxies have reminded us that we’re all in it together. Not really, though. Mitsotakis got into trouble for breaking Covid restrictions and Véran’s house was searched  by the French police following legal complaints about the government’s handling of the pandemic. And thanks to Poulter and Mercer’s government, the NHS workers who jabbed them will be receiving a mere 1% pay rise as a thank you. So what has the vaxxie taught us about the modern man? Two things really: 1) we have all over-exercised in lockdown and 2) apparently none of us owns any short-sleeved tops.   Priya Elan is the Guardian’s deputy fashion editor \\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'Nobody is more irritating when you are ill than your own family | Zoe Williams',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'What I never noticed before I got Covid was the thriving black market in stories and speculation about the virus, the after-virus and the sheer unadulterated weirdness of the human body. The public sphere is, understandably, preoccupied with the disease at its most harrowing – “happy hypoxia”, ventilators, months of post-viral fatigue. I get that completely. If you’re going to make a social effort to understand a disease, it’s most helpful to start with: “It’s nothing like flu.” In the sphere of the private, meanwhile, we’re swapping weird, inconsequential symptoms, like a prehistoric culture trying to work out what a cold is. “Did you have snot? You’re not supposed to have snot, and yet I had much snot.” “No, but I had a pain in my eyebrow.” “Was it on the eyebrow or behind the eyebrow?” Last time I overshared my health status, I had tested positive but Mr Z hadn’t, and shortly afterwards, he did too. I’d say it went on for about 10 days, and he had it worse than I did; he disputes this, and there is no way of saying who’s right unless Oprah Winfrey is willing to get involved (joke! Obviously Meghan is right). No one day was worse than a bad hangover, but you would never get a hangover for 10 days straight, so in aggregate it was worse. On the plus side, it wasn’t self-inflicted. I’m more or less certain Mr Z brought the virus home from the shop, and he was definitely getting something necessary, not a snacking chorizo and some banana milk. My friend T mulled this over. “I don’t think I’ve ever had any disease that’s worse than a bad hangover.” I ruminated on this for ages. What is worse than the worst hangover? Maybe childbirth? It’s not a symptom, as such, but it is impossible to overstate how annoying my family was. My sister and stepmother were delighted by the turn of events, like they had been watching EastEnders for 17 years and finally something had happened. “Any Covid toe?”, they would text hopefully. “Michael Rosen lost the hearing in one ear, you know.” My brother messaged to say: “The time to go on about how it was no big deal is after it, rather than during,” which was the ultimate sibling checkmate. I couldn’t reply “It is no big deal,” since it was still “during”. I couldn’t reply “It is a big deal,” because it wasn’t. It reminded me of the time he beat me at hangman with the word “two”. I was so sure that he just didn’t realise “too” had two Os that I couldn’t see past it. He was four, and I was 14. My mother, whom I had seen while I was probably infectious, became convinced that she also had Covid but was blissfully asymptomatic, which struck me as pretty unlikely, considering she just has to see someone with a cold from across a motorway to end up in hospital with pneumonia. I ordered her a test anyway. I explained in quite close detail how you had to register it before you took it, and in the peculiar way of families that you can hear what they’re thinking down a phone line, she thought: “Blah blah, how much more of this customer service nonsense do I have to listen to?” Duly, she didn’t register it properly and waited 10 more days for her negative result. “Cumbersome system,” she complained, and I agreed that yes, having to attach your name and address to a barcode before anyone could contact you was indeed a ludicrous thing, and I blamed Tory cronyism. Back to the symptoms. Just as I was more or less recovered, I did something to my back. “Are you sure it’s not your kidneys?” (my sister). “This happened to Ellen DeGeneres!” (my stepmother). It was mad. I could just about exist if I was always walking, but as soon as I sat down, it could take me anything up to 37 minutes to get up again. I walked so much I broke my Fitbit. This is when I discovered the subculture of people who think Covid has mystic properties – it roams around your body, unearthing hidden weakness and reviving infections from decades ago. I spoke to someone whose symptoms were basically his 1995 labyrinthitis all over again; someone else said it was just like cystitis. It’s impossible to overstate how many people believe this, and have an entirely new conception of their corporeal self as basically an archive of ailments, waiting to be triggered by an unguessable password made of proteins. Science, it turns out, can supply a bunch of reasons for this, but I find the wisdom of crowds more intoxicating, un-peer-reviewable. As suddenly as it had gone, my back was better, and everything was normal, and I had learned some awful home truths, such as how annoying everyone I live with finds me. “It’s so relaxing when you have a bit less energy,” my son said. “I love it when you’re stuck in a chair and I can walk away before you start messing with my hair,” said my daughter. But did I learn anything useful about corona, anything you might call a general principle, applicable beyond the four walls of myself? Not so much.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'Gucci and Gaga bring Hollywood cheer to tiny Italian Alps village',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'For a few days this week, a tiny mountain village in the Aosta valley sprang back to life as it became abuzz with Hollywood stars. Gressoney-Saint-Jean, which lies at the bottom of Monte Rosa, was the first location in Italy for the filming of Ridley Scott’s House of Gucci, based on the true story of the killing of the former chief of the fashion house, Maurizio Gucci, by his ex-wife, Patrizia Reggiani. As with all ski resorts in Italy, Gressoney-Saint-Jean, home to about 800 people, was forced to cut off its seasonal lifeline because of the coronavirus pandemic. “The loss of the ski season has caused huge economic damage,” Mattia Alliod, the mayor of Gressoney-Saint-Jean, said. “For months we have been closed and have had no visitors, apart from those who have been able to come to their second homes over the last few weeks. So as you can imagine, the arrival of the film crew was like a breath of fresh air.”  Graphic    A behind-the-scenes photo of Lady Gaga, who plays Reggiani in the film, and Adam Driver, who portrays Maurizio Gucci, taken on the balcony of what appears to be a ski lodge overlooking the Alps, garnered much excitement when it was shared on Lady Gaga’s Instagram account. She is wearing chunky jewellery and a white fur hat, and commenters noted her striking resemblance to Reggiani.    Al Pacino in Milan shooting House of Gucci. Photograph: Alessandro Bremec/NurPhoto/Rex/Shutterstock   Other stars of the film include Al Pacino as Aldo Gucci, Jared Leto as Paolo Gucci and Jeremy Irons as Rodolfo Gucci. All of the hotels in Gressoney-Saint-Jean, which is based on the resort of San Moritz, to where the Gucci couple would retreat in the 1980s, were put to use to host the stars and production crew of about 250, while residents were called upon to help prepare the sets. “Even if it was just for four or five days, people were able to work,” said Alliod. “And on a psychological level, after a year of the pandemic, the filming gave us all a bit of a lift.”    Director Ridley Scott on the set of House of Gucci in Milan. Photograph: Mairo Cinquetti/NurPhoto/Rex/Shutterstock   The crew has now moved on to Milan before eventually shooting in other locations in Italy including Rome, Florence and Lake Como. The film, due for release in October, is based on the book by Sara Gay Forden, The House of Gucci: A Sensational Story of Murder, Madness, Glamour and Greed. It recounts the story of Reggiani, who hired a hitman to kill Gucci outside his office in Milan in 1995 after he went off with another woman. Reggiani, who was dubbed the “Black Widow” by the Italian media during her high-profile trial, was released from prison in 2016 after serving 17 years of her 29-year sentence. Gucci, who was the grandson of Guccio Gucci, the founder of the fashion house, was 46 when he was shot dead. Reggiani said in a recent interview that she was so desperate to murder her estranged husband that she went around asking everyone if they could do it on her behalf, “even the local shopkeeper”. She added that she needed a hitman as she “didn’t have a good aim”. Reggiani said on Thursday she was annoyed that Lady Gaga hadn’t arranged to meet her before filming. Italy has served as a backdrop for other films during the pandemic, including Tom Cruise’s Mission: Impossible 7, which was shot in Rome and Venice last year. “This kind of publicity only does good for Italy,” said Alliod. “Even for a small town like ours, it becomes known around the world. So we’re all now hoping it will help to turn things around next season.”\\n',\n",

       "  'title': \"Son of Queen's former aide-de-camp in Sri Lanka rallies to her defence\",\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Maj Gen Anton Muttukumaru was a barrister, soldier and diplomat who loved collecting walking sticks. He was known for being charming and shrewd, had a talent for mimicry, and was once driven to Ascot to join the Queen because she was too busy enjoying the races to meet him at Buckingham Palace. Born in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), Muttukumaru was the Queen’s aide-de-camp in 1954. Now, almost 70 years on, and with the royal family caught in a race storm in the wake of the Oprah Winfrey interview with Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Muttukumaru’s son Christopher spoke to the Guardian about his father’s experiences. He described the friendship his father had with the Queen which endured for years beyond his time in service. “Years later, whenever my father came to the UK to visit my family and me – long after he had any official position in the army or diplomatic service – the Queen would give him a private audience in Buckingham Palace,” said Christopher, a former general counsel to the Department for Transport. “There was no need for her to do that – my father was just an ordinary member of the public by this time – but she made time in her diary for him from the 70s onwards.” One year, when the Queen was at Ascot at the time of Muttukumaru’s visit, her private secretary arranged for him and his wife to be driven to see her there. “My parents watched the races with the Queen in the royal box and my father won £25 – which he was cock-a-hoop about because he didn’t know the first thing about horse racing,” Christopher said. The first Sri Lanka-born soldier to command his country’s army, Muttukumaru read PPE at Jesus College, Oxford, in 1928 and became a lawyer at Gray’s Inn before returning home in 1934. Muttukumaru joined the Ceylon Defence Force and at the outbreak of the second world war he was in charge of the South East Asia Command headquarters in Kandy.    Muttukumaru poses next to the Queen Mother in Canberra. The Australian PM, Harold Holt, and Muttukumaru’s wife are to the left of the royal. Photograph: Family handout   After the war, Muttukumaru came to London to lead his soldiers in the victory parade. He returned six years later with his men for the funeral of George VI in 1952, and a third time a year later for the Queen’s coronation. Hearing of his plan to attend her coronation, the soon-to-be Queen issued a personal invitation – couched as a command – to attend the service in Westminster Abbey. Muttukumaru, however, decided to march with his soldiers instead. According to his 2001 obituary in the Telegraph, the Queen forgave his refusal and, after later seeing his men mounting guard at Buckingham Palace along with her own guardsmen, congratulated him on the smartness of his men. “Regarding the controversy over a member of the royal family asking (if true) about the colour of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s son, my point is that if she was somebody who harboured views about coloured or black people, it certainly didn’t come through in her treatment of my father,” Christopher said. Muttukumaru went on to become his country’s high commissioner to Australia, New Zealand and Pakistan. In 1966 he became ambassador to Egypt. Four years previously he had hosted lunch for the Queen Mother in Canberra with his wife, Peggy, and the then Australian prime minister, Harold Holt. Muttukumaru, who died in 2000 aged 92, always spoke with great affection of the Queen’s treatment of him, said his son.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'The Day Of Six Doughnuts has led me to take drastic action: bye bye, sugar | Romesh Ranganathan',\n",
       "  'full_article': \"Last week, I got a box of 12 doughnuts to share between me and the kids (my wife has this amazing condition which means she is indifferent to doughnuts). For breakfast, we each had one doughnut. Then, throughout the morning, I popped into the kitchen a couple of times while I was working and helped myself to one. So far, so enjoyable. A little later, I walked into the kitchen to be greeted by an intervention. The concerned party, which comprised the rest of my family, informed me that they went to get a doughnut and saw that I had in fact eaten six of them. Before lunch! They were horrified. Immediately I knew two things: 1) I have a problem and 2) I definitely shouldn’t tell them that I was going to the kitchen to get a seventh doughnut. I decided I needed to give up sugar. I realise this seems extreme, but I had read somewhere that if you stop eating sugar for a few weeks, the next time you eat a tangerine it will taste like a meringue. Or something. Basically, I wanted to reset my tastebuds. Some scientists have claimed sugar is as addictive as cocaine, and the more of it you get used to having, the more you need. I grew up in a house, and a time, where the true evils of sugar had not been realised. Instead, parents marvelled at sugar’s incredible power to get children to eat stuff. We put it on cereal, we put it on fruit, we put it on bread and had sugar sandwiches. My mum saw it as a miracle ingredient. We used to have a fizzy drinks man who would come round and deliver various bottles, pretending not to notice how increasingly obese the kids of the house were getting every week. So I have always been aware that I eat too much sugar. But it took the Day Of Six (With Intent For Seven) Doughnuts to really shake me into taking action. I sought advice from a friend who told me he had given up through sheer willpower and a desire to get healthier. I asked him how he had managed to cut out cakes and biscuits, and he told me he still ate them all the time; he just meant he’d stopped having sugar in coffee and tea. I realised he was a fraud who was wasting my time. Hardcore sugar abstainers give up not just sugar, but simple carbs, which turn into sugar, as well as processed food that has added sugar. They also immediately spit out anything that they start to enjoy, because that probably means it has sugar in it, too. I went for a more intermediate option: to avoid any added sugar, and to not have white bread, pasta or rice. My strategy was to keep it up for 10 days and then tuck into a piece of toast that would by then taste like gateau.   Related: I've become a serial takeaway eater. No shame. No guilt. Just eat on repeat | Romesh Ranganathan   Apparently, people attempting to restrict sugar need to drink lots of water, something that I am particularly bad at. I will often reach the end of the day and have a wee that looks fairly close to marmalade, before declaring to my wife that I have no idea why I don’t feel in top nick. I started my day with water, chopped banana and porridge with no sugar (I usually add a half-litre of agave). Absolutely disgusting. For a mid-morning snack I had a sliced apple with some chilli powder (sounds crazy, but it’s incredible) before a lunch of fairly plain vegetables. By late afternoon, I was absolutely battered. My head was thumping and I felt completely exhausted. My wife suggested I just cut down rather than go cold turkey. She offered me an Oreo. I ate it. I promise you, it was like a magic potion. My headache disappeared, I felt energised and my mood improved. A warning of how strong my addiction is? Or a sign that I should never try to give up again? I know which way I’m going.\\n\",\n",

       "  'full_article': \"It’s my birthday next week and I am virtual-party planning: a culmination of so many life lessons that squeezing them all into this column may be tight. But I shall try. From a year of remote parties and working from home, I’ve learned to keep the party small to prevent overtalk; short to respect screen-time exhaustion; tight with ice-breaking activities; and to aim to do something quick, sweet and life-affirming. Of course, some lessons can never be learned. Like starting the planning earlier. And knowing that although I say I want to do nothing – that I don’t want a fuss or for people to spend money – my mother will never let it happen. “Don’t be selfish, your birthday is not just your day,” she says, knowing guilt works, and that I’ll enjoy it in the end. (Another lesson: Mother knows best.)   Related: In these testing times, I'm embracing the art of navel-gazing | Coco Khan   And one lesson has been a long time coming: that letting people show love can’t always be convenient. For years I’d have my birthday celebration at venues close to where friends lived to save them the commute (and guarantee attendance). But if they were going to come, some travel wouldn’t make a difference, and if they couldn’t, they could find some other way to show their love – so why not design my day around where I want to be? Which is why this year my virtual party will be talent show themed. Everyone will have to perform for 60 seconds – whether it’s playing the tin whistle or juggling satsumas. I figure it will be entertaining and make a change from me being the tit of my party. I remember once, at a low point, a dear friend listed off a dozen names of my loved ones and said: “All of these people would jump through hoops for you, woman.” Hoops, eh?

       "  'title': \"Mother's Day wines to lift the spirits | Fiona Beckett on drink\",\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Regular readers of this column may recall that I was talking about wine descriptions a couple of weeks back and said I couldn’t understand why the word “lush” wasn’t used more often. Admittedly, it wouldn’t be part of your average Master of Wine’s lexicon, but if someone tells me a wine is lush, I want to try it. And not just because I live in Bristol, where “gert lush” is the ultimate term of approbation. Anyway, having recently tasted a lot of whites I regarded as lush, I thought it might be an appropriate topic to return to for Mother’s Day. Not that I am suggesting for a second that your mother is a lush, even if she does have a glass every night – I wouldn’t blame her, given the unremitting tedium of the past 12 months. What makes a wine lush? It’s a question of texture as much as anything: smoothness, richness, roundness, and no harsh edges. White wines such as pinot grigio and picpoul may be refreshing, but they’re not lush. Nor, to my mind, are heavily oaked cabernets or the sort of light reds you can chill, much as I like them. As I thought more about this, it dawned on me that the grape varieties that are used to make sweet wines are often lush in their drier incarnations – semillon and sauvignon, the grapes that produce sauternes, for instance. In fact, sauvignon on its own can be, too, especially if it’s packed with passionfruit and other tropical fruits, as it tends to be in New Zealand. Chenin blanc, the backbone of sweet Loire whites such as Quarts de Chaume and Côteaux du Layon, can be glorious – particularly as it ages. Aromatic wines such as riesling, pinot gris and gewürztraminer, ditto. And I’m a big fan of furmint, the grape used to make Hungary’s famous sweet wine tokaji, although I admit “Have a glass of furmint, Mum” doesn’t have quite the same ring as “Have a glass of prosecco”. Nonetheless, I suspect many mothers would enjoy a glass of Füleky Tokaji Furmint 2014 (13%), a delightfully exotic wine you can get for £16.49 from Borders Wines in Coldstream. The downside is that lushness tends to come at a price. It’s generally achieved through low-yielding vines and expensive oak barrels, but put that in context: you can easily pay £30 for a bottle of champagne and, were we able to go to restaurants right now, you’d likely be spending a similar amount on a house favourite. And mums deserve the best, right? Nuff said. Five wines to give on Mother’s Day       Asda Extra Special Rueda 2019 £5.50, 13%. Easy-drinking rueda is a good, affordable option for lovers of lushness. Good with a seafood platter.       Boekenhouts-kloof Semillon 2018 £20 (in bond) Lay & Wheeler, £20.83 (in bond) NY Wines, 13.5%. If your mum’s a bit of a wine buff, she’ll love this sensationally smooth South African semillon from Franschhoek (with roast salmon, I suggest). One of the best whites I’ve tasted this year.       Vasse Felix Classic Semillon Sauvignon Blanc 2020 £12 Tesco, 13%. A combo that you’ll find in sweet wines such as sauternes, and that’s gorgeous in this dry Aussie incarnation from Margaret River. Another one for salmon.       Queen Bee Viognier 2020 £10.99 by the mixed case Averys, 12.5%. What better name for a Mother’s Day wine, and a rich, peachy viognier from the Western Cape to boot? Drink with roast chicken.       Seifried Estate Sweet Agnes Riesling 2018 £16.29 a half-bottle Waitrose, 10.5%. A brilliant Kiwi dessert wine that I’ve recommended before, but it deserves another airing, especially if your mother’s name happens to be Agnes (although there is a heated debate between Shelagh and Michael on the Waitrose website as to whether it’s too sweet).    • For more by Fiona Beckett, go to matchingfoodandwine.com  \\n',\n",

It’s 8 March, a date forever to be inscribed on parental hearts. My husband has taken our child to school. School-school. No creeping like a snail (I know it’s really “creeping like snail” – I went to school-school on the non-pandemic regular and was taught it there, but it sounds wrong and stupid and you know it does, so don’t write in) unwillingly. After eleventy billion days of locked down home schooling, the nine-year-old and his father went like lightning. The only thing faster was me shutting the door behind them. Back pressed firmly against it, I gazed about me in disbelief. A strange roaring filled my ears. It took me a moment to identify. It was actually the sound of silence. There was no shouting. No groans of boredom or despair. No exhortations to “Concentrate!” or “Just do it!” There was no weeping, child or adult. Just silence. I had a coffee. Quietly. I went up the stairs to my office, unencumbered. I did six hours’ work uninterrupted. Nobody asked me how to divide a fraction by a decimal, by what means river deltas or headlands are formed or how the gibbering feck 28 phases of the moon should be labelled.   Related: Digested week: surgery scared me stiff. I'm sure I used to be a stoical hypochondriac   Social media filled with people saying how unexpectedly and how much they missed their absent children. Either I’m an even worse mother than I suspected or every one of them was lying through their teeth. I’m too relaxed now to care either way. Tuesday But if you are missing your ankle-biters, manbaby Piers Morgan filled the void by storming off the set of Good Morning Britain – instantly making it a Better Morning Britain – after being calmly taken to task by his co-host Alex Beresford over his repeated diatribes against Meghan (fuelled, many have speculated, by the fact that Morgan once had a drink with her, yet this somehow failed to secure him an invitation to the wedding). “OK, I’m done with this,” huffed Morgan, waddling his way furiously out of the studio. “Sorry, can’t do this.” It would have taken a heart of stone not to laugh. The two-minute segment should be exhibited on a loop, entitled The Fragility of Narcissists and entered for the Turner prize. Maybe with a plaque underneath engraved with the tweet Morgan sent shortly afterwards giving Churchill’s quote – I’m sorry, just give me a second to compose myself – “Some people’s idea of free speech is that they are free to say what they like, but if anyone says anything back, that is an outrage.” Actually, forget The Fragility of Narcissists. Call it Irony is Dead But I Assure You These are Tears of Extravagant Mirth. Wednesday We live in a block of flats owned by the council. Every six months or so the communal pipes block and water (though not waste, thank the occasionally benevolent gods) backs up and comes flooding, via washing machine and sink, into our kitchen. It’s good times. Now it’s happened again, so I must pick up the phone and call the housing/plumbing/It’s Happened Again Why Can’t You Address the Root Cause of an Issue departments. This wipes out every emotional resource I have for at least 24 hours. I don’t know why, at the age of 46, ringing any kind of authority to make any kind of request or complaint fills me with apprehension, stress and tearful anxiety, but it does. I have tried to unpack my own root issue here in the hope of addressing it, but whatever psychological blockage there is remains unyielding. All I can say is that I know I am not alone. My mother, sister and several friends suffer the same handicap. There’s a fear of being told off mixed in there somewhere, a feeling that we’re transgressing some unspoken law that we don’t deserve help and should be able to manage without it. I haven’t been able to plumb it further than that. If anyone can, please let me know. I would love my psychological life to flow freely one day. Thursday  The palace statement released on Tuesday in the wake of Harry and Meghan’s “we want to be alone” interview has now been stripped and sold for parts. As ever there is ample subtext to be read and enjoyed by the light of a flickering, evanescent flame, and a loose transcription might run: “You want a passive-aggressive showdown, babes? This – this is how it’s done,” but of the text itself the nation has decided there was only one phrase worth keeping, namely: “Some recollections may vary.” Sure, in its original context it’s an ignoble attempt to muddy the waters around accusations of racism within The Firm but lift it out of that and its applications, domestic, professional, personal, public, become almost infinite. “Whose turn is it to do the dishwasher?” “Some recollections may vary.” “Who should have sent the vital email?” “Some recollections may vary.” Randy Andy could note its value in even a legal setting, should we ever turn our attention away from the would-be Garbos. “Did you have sex with the 17-year-old girl you’re seen holding in the company of the suspected procurer Ghislaine Maxwell for the known paedophile Jeffrey Epstein?” “Some recollections may vary.” Perfect. Friday Just before Christmas I dislocated my goddamn ankle and smashed my cuboid bone, like a twit. Today my physio gave me permission to walk (in my big airboot thingy) without crutches indoors and just use the one – one! –outdoors. It’s incredible. I feel like I’m dancing, like I’m floating, even though in fact I’m still hobbling like a recent guest at Kathy Bates’s B&B. Four legs were good and necessary, but three or two is so, so much better. My own mini-lockdown within a lockdown is over and I feel like I could burst with happiness. When the real thing lifts, I realise, we are all going to go absolutely bonkers. The powers that be need to start considering additional vaccination programmes for STIs and/or filling us all with that stuff that makes you sick if you drink alcohol, rolling out rehydration stalls on every street corner and providing all parents with lassoes to recapture their children as, bedazzled by freedom, they light out for the hills. It’s going to be great, is what I’m saying. I know we’re all barely limping along now, but we’ll get there. And it’s going to be great.    ‘So this time, right – right? – the bridge goes from us – this bit is us, isn’t it? Albion? Blighty?

       "  'title': 'Aretha Franklin: newly discovered will draft complicates estate dispute',\n",
       "  'full_article': \"A fourth possible will has been discovered in the attempt to finalise the estate of Aretha Franklin. Filed in a Michigan court this week, the eight-page document, titled The Will of Aretha Franklin, was apparently drawn up in 2018 along with an additional document outlining the terms of a trust, the New York Times reports. Both papers are unsigned and marked as drafts. The new draft will would create a trust to benefit her son Clarence, who has undisclosed special needs, and would split the remaining assets among her other three sons along with specific inheritances to other relatives. According to lawyers for two of Franklin’s sons, Ted White Jr and Clarence Franklin, the documents show that the soul star had retained a lawyer, Henry M Grix, “for over two years”. After she “fell very ill”, another lawyer told Grix she was unable to sign the papers.   Related: Aretha Franklin's 30 greatest songs – ranked!   A previous will draft, dated March 2014, would give a greater share to her youngest son, Kecalf, and less to Clarence. Written in a spiral-bound notebook, the document was hard to decipher, with words scratched out and phrases written in the margins. It was discovered – under sofa cushions – alongside two other wills, in Franklin’s Detroit home more than six months after her death. Initially she was thought to have left no will. Franklin’s estate has an estimated value of up to $80m (£57.4m). A trial is due in August to establish whether any of the documents, some of which are handwritten, can formally stand as a will. Despite being unsigned, the newly discovered document could dictate the terms of Franklin’s estate if evidence shows that she intended it as such. Among the Franklin estate’s forthcoming projects is Respect, a biopic in which Jennifer Hudson will play the legendary singer.\\n\",\n",

       "  'full_article': \"David de Gea’s availability for Manchester United’s game against West Ham on Sunday is “touch and go” because of the goalkeeper having to quarantine after returning this week from paternity leave in Spain. The 30-year-old was at the birth of his first child, having last played in United’s goalless draw at Chelsea on 28 February. Dean Henderson had impressed in the Spain international’s absence until the error that allowed Simon Kjær’s late equaliser in Thursday’s 1-1 draw with Milan in the Europa League last-16 first leg. He kept a clean sheet as United beat Manchester City, the leaders, 2-0 last Sunday.   Related: Chris Wilder latest, Women's Champions League draw, Premier League and more – live!   Government rules state that anyone entering the UK has to self-isolate for 10 days, though this can be shortened after five by paying for a test that, if negative, allows the person in question to stop quarantining.  Ole Gunnar Solskjær said: “He is back in Manchester – he is self-isolating. He is just touch and go for Sunday, I think. I can’t really know when he came back so I am not really sure if it was Monday or Tuesday. The rules are he has to stay at home – he is not training with us anyway. It’s different if you travel away and compete. He has not been training since he came back.” Meanwhile United are discussing a new contract with Eric Bailly. The centre-back, whose current deal expires in June 2022, has been plagued with injuries since joining the club from Villarreal for £25m in June 2016. He was José Mourinho’s first acquisition as United manager.   The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.  “We have started talking to Eric and Eric’s representatives,” Solskjær said. “Eric is keeping fitter for longer. He is getting more robust. You can see his performances as well – I have been very happy with him. His playing style has made him lose [miss] too many games because 100 games, that’s not enough for the period that he has been here. He is one we are talking to.” Looking ahead to his team facing David Moyes’s West Ham, who are six points behind United and start the weekend in fifth, Solskjær said: “They have been brilliant. David has done a tremendous job, that we know he is capable of and I am very happy for him. We know it is a big game for us. It’s maybe too far ahead to City so we need to consolidate our place in the top two or three.”\\n\",\n",

       "  'full_article': 'I don’t know why I’m writing about this really, because nothing happened. Compared to what happens, nothing really happened. And in the five minutes it took to not happen – between 4.55pm and 5pm yesterday – he was never closer to me than three feet. What a respectful distance from which to be called a “dirty cunt”, my ha-di-ha-ha brain is saying. I was merely verbally aggressed by a stranger in a socially distanced way. Plus it all feels a bit convenient for a columnist, right? And I agree – being followed and simultaneously screamed at by some guy I’d never clapped eyes on before yesterday afternoon was nothing if not convenient. Look, I’m writing a column about it today. But before this outbreak of convenience, this column honestly was going to be a fictional imagining of the royal family attending implicit bias training. I don’t want you to conclude I didn’t have other wares for this space if it hadn’t been for the convenient nothing that happened. I’m absolutely and completely fine, I said to my editor, when I told him what I’d write about instead. Really, it’s just – [don’t say “part of life”, don’t say “part of life”] – it’s just part of life! I told him the truth, that I genuinely forget about these things soon after they happen. Except I’m writing this stupid record of this one now. Should have just tied a weight round it and sent it to sleep with the fishes, with all the other ones. The healthy option. But please, I said to him, please tell me if it comes out wrong. I never say that with any other column, but of course we ladies worry about telling our own stories wrongly or unsuccessfully. Anyway, I’m walking to collect one of my children after school yesterday, down the street I always take. It’s never lovelier than now, when all the magnolias are coming out. He stares hard, passes. Stops. Behind me: “What are you looking at?” Honestly? The end of the street. How is it that the end of this empty London street, where there’s a busier road and then a square, has suddenly stretched to a point somewhere just beyond Moscow? What happens to time and space when these nothings happen? This whole nothing is going to take five minutes, yet feel so long it’s like I could have learned Mandarin, or written a novel. You absorb every incidental detail. Just in case! And in every split second, you’re somehow able to consider multiple possible theories as to what is, or isn’t, happening. “I’m talking to you. Fucking turn round.” Really? Today? When it starts not happening, I’m just thinking: oh, but this is such a COINCIDENCE! I mean, I’ve spent all day reading women’s stories of nowhere near all the things that have happened to them just walking down streets. Maybe this is happening because I didn’t offer up my own stories. Maybe I’ve angered the social media gods. “Dirty cunt.” Man, this guy is really ruining the magnolias for me. I’m walking so fast now I’m not even looking at the magnolias. Still, this is SUCH a coincidence. Actually, let’s be statistically rational. It’s just an incidence. Whenever these nothings happen, you understand very powerfully that they are singling you out to tell you you’re not special. You, a 46-year-old woman in a double bobble hat that makes you look like Mickey Mouse, which is why you chose it, are not special. Right now, at 4.56pm on a spring afternoon, countless women are being harassed in the street. I wonder what a UK heat map of incidence would look like. Hot, I guess. He’s walking alongside me now. “Hello? HELLO?” Quick, do the triage. How seriously do I take him? He hasn’t grabbed me, so my sense is that he’s one of the good street harassers. That would be great news for this fucking whore currently being asked who the fuck she thinks she is. Hang on, he’s got a shopping bag. New data points, need to establish what’s in it. Oh. A really big box of chocolates. I wonder if he’s saying sorry to someone. Or maybe I love you. “I love you. Also, you’ll never guess what I did on the way home.” He seems to be wearing A Distinctive Jacket, which is pointless, since I’m not going to be troubling the police with this. You can’t, can you? Where would you start. Where would you stop. Hopefully he’ll stop. On the back of the jacket – thank God, I’m seeing the back of his jacket now, which means he’s passed me by again – it says “The Wonderers”. They sound nice. I wonder what he’s wondering about. Why I’m some fucking lesbian whore is what he’s saying. But I wonder what he’s really wondering about. If this is the bit he’s saying out loud, I wonder about the inner monologue. Oh dear. Now I’m seeing the front of his jacket again, and he’s coming back towards me. Can’t he see there are now people around, because I’ve reached the square? But he’s one of the ones that doesn’t mind an audience. What do people who can now see us think is happening, I wonder crossly. Crossly enough to find my voice and say: Stay away from me. I say it loudly and clearly, so the two guys working on the road about 15 metres away will hear. They look up, and I look right at them, quickly because I daren’t take my eyes off The Wonderer. But then they carry on with their work. Come on guys – don’t you read the internet? Hashtag be an ally! Given I’m still learning what a fucking bitch I am, and at quite some volume, I say it again. STAY AWAY FROM ME. I can see I’m holding my hand out in a stop sign. Who am I – the street harassment Gandalf? My hand seems a little shaky. Let’s be real. If he wants to, this street harasser shall pass. He hangs around even as I pick up my son, so we get a great send-off as we hurry away. I used to think holding the hands of children, tightly, would exempt you from the consideration of street abusers, but I’ve long noticed that for some guys, it simply makes it more special. “Why was he doing it if you didn’t say anything to him?” wonders my son. I know! It does seem very irrational, doesn’t it. What a silly man. “He’s like The Angry Man,” notes my son, which is what my children called some other guy who followed us down our own road screaming about something to do with their bikes. Exactly, I say. “Why are they so angry?” Oh wow … I don’t know. I mean, there are … a lot of theories. Anyway, how was school? “Fine. Why are we going home this way?” Because this is the way we go now. We’re probably going to go a few different ways for a bit. So this is one of the ways we go now. Let’s just get home. I mean, nothing really happened. Still, good question, all things considered. Why are they so angry? It does feel like way, way, way past time we found out.

       "  'full_article': 'José Mourinho insists he has not taken much notice of Arsenal before Sunday’s north London derby because he looks up and not down the Premier League table. Tottenham sit seventh with 45 points – three places and seven points ahead of their rivals going into the encounter at the Emirates Stadium. Even with the absence of crowds, the fixture is a daunting one for both sides, with the visitors facing the task of becoming only the second team to win at Arsenal this year, with the other being Manchester City.   Related: José Mourinho wants a trophy for Spurs chairman Levy to mark 1,000th game   Mourinho is in typically bullish mood going into the derby, however, claiming he sees it as merely another game for his team to navigate as they look to make up ground in the pursuit of a top-four place. And he is perhaps right to be speaking so confidently given Tottenham’s form – they have won six of their past seven games in all competitions, scoring 20 times in the process. “I look up, I don’t look down. If Arsenal was seven points ahead of us I would look to them but because we have seven points more than them, I don’t look down,” said Mourinho. “At the same time, we look always to the next match and if instead of Arsenal it was Villa or Newcastle – exactly the same feeling. “We feel we’re better than the position we have in the table and we want to improve our position so we need points for that. It doesn’t matter the opponent, doesn’t matter if it is a derby. It’s a Premier League match, three points are there to fight for and that’s what we’re going to do.”    Harry Kane celebrates with Gareth Bale after scoring Tottenham’s second goal in their Europa League last-16 first leg victory over Dinamo Zagreb on Thursday. Photograph: Julian Finney/Getty Images   As well as somewhat brushing off the threat of Arsenal, Mourinho did also praise the club, describing them as one “with a big history”. “Like us they’re trying to build a better future,” the Portuguese added. “I have total respect for them.” Mourinho has a number of selection dilemmas going into Sunday’s game, among them who to play at right-back: Serge Aurier or Matt Doherty. Asked about this after Thursday’s Europa League victory over Dinamo Zagreb, Mourinho gave a rather rambling answer but one that suggests he is finally happy with the make-up and output of his squad.   The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.  “They [Aurier and Doherty] are both playing well and that’s what I need, that’s what the team needs,” he said. “Ben Davies and Sergio Reguilón [too]. I’m just talking about the full-backs but the reason why we changed seven players from the last match was because I trust all the guys. The last time I did this we lost against Antwerp and everybody was killing me. And rightly so, because I made these decisions but in that match I felt let down by attitude and it was a moment where not everybody was working well. “The question was about Serge and Matt but I went in other directions with my answer. But the reality is everybody is playing well.”\\n',\n",

       "  'full_article': 'I miss frivolity. Does that make me a bad person? Maybe it does in your book. In which case, I’m sorry. But it’s true. I miss life with all its bells and whistles. I am bored with zipping up puffers and layering on neutrals, and dressing with stoic practicality. I miss shoulder-robing and lipgloss and animal print, and going out bare-legged because it looks better. If you sympathise – even just a tiny bit, secretly – then my fashion prescription for me and for you, this week, is to find the most impractical coat in your wardrobe and wear it on as many occasions as you can get away with. The cardigan coat that is completely useless in the rain? Sky is clear, so perfect. Conceptual “layering pieces” that don’t have sleeves? Ideal with a puff-sleeved jumper. Flimsy dalmatian-print numbers that don’t keep you warm? Hiya! Freedom is inching closer, and in that spirit I am liberating myself from my puffer jacket, simply because I’m bored with it. This winter has, after all, been 67 months long. There are a lot of other aspects of my current lifestyle I’m bored with, but most of them are not within my power to change. I’m stuck with my own cooking. I’m stuck with looking at my own face in meetings, unless I pull the old “camera off” technique, and let my voice boom out of a dark square like one of the Jedi elders in Star Wars. But, if the weather plays nice, there’s no reason why I can’t wear a new coat.   Related: Remember wearing proper trousers? Let me jog your memory | Jess Cartner-Morley   Not that this is a new coat. Shopping, funnily enough, is not something I particularly miss about fashion. I shopped this coat from my wardrobe, having bought it from Zara at least five years ago, maybe 10. (I am perplexed by that aspect of the fast-fashion narrative which suggests high street clothes fall apart after a few weeks. So snooty and so entirely out of touch with reality. I have loads of high street clothes I’ve been wearing for decades.) But after the aforementioned 67 months in a puffer jacket, it feels borderline transgressive to wear an outfit that hasn’t been chosen purely to meet a set of logistical and meteorological conditions. Most of life’s bells and whistles aren’t coming back just yet. But as spring picks up, clothes are an opportunity to make life feel a little lighter. Even a tiny bit frivolous.

       "  'title': 'Ski-ba-bop-ba-dop-bop: is scatting having a revival?',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'There is a joyous moment halfway through R&B singer Serpentwithfeet’s latest single, Same Size Shoe. In a tender falsetto, he calls for his “trumpet” before unleashing a series of rhythmic vowel sounds: a fanfaring instrumental solo with only his own voice over a minimal backing. To those unfamiliar with the phenomenon, this is scat singing. And to hear it amid a loved-up ballad in 2021 begs the question: is scatting back?   Related: The Guide: Staying In  – sign up for our home entertainment tips   Loosely defined as vocal improvisations with a wordless melody, scatting is a term perhaps most readily associated with cartoonish imaginings of zoot-suited men snapping their fingers in smoky jazz bars. While it might seem like a lost musical artform, it has always existed in popular music beyond its native genre, jazz. Rapper Eazy-E channelled a horn-like scat in his 1990 track Eazy Street, while Busta Rhymes and Twista’s hyperspeed flows often veer into scatting territory. In pop, Beyoncé overlayed an electric guitar solo with a scat on 2011’s I Care, while Amy Winehouse laced 2003’s Frank with it. In R&B, scatting finds its ultimate expression in Lalah Hathaway, who has pioneered a remarkable chordal voicing of the form. Of course, there was also the vocal acrobatics of Scatman John, whose novelty track Scatman (Ski-Ba-Bop-Ba-Dop-Bop) conquered the charts in 1994. It could be argued that even the infernal ringtone-revving of the Crazy Frog owes its influence to scat singing.    Historically a cornerstone of the jazz singer’s repertoire, the earliest recorded examples are thought to be found in a scratchy 1911 portion of the ragtime singer Gene Greene’s King of the Bungaloos – a chaotic segment that veers from bouncy monosyllables to a gravelly Popeye impression – or Al Jolson’s That Haunting Melody, which gives the scat a more languorous tone. It was not until the godfather of New Orleans jazz, Louis Armstrong, came along that scatting became a popular pursuit. His 1926 recording of the tune Heebie Jeebies saw Armstrong employ his signature baritone growl for a vocal improvisation. The song’s ensuing popularity saw scatting incorporated into Armstrong’s performances, while contemporaries such as Duke Ellington used scat sections as the core for compositions such as his Creole Love Call. Vocal powerhouses Ella Fitzgerald and Sarah Vaughan transitioned from verse to scat solos in their songs, employing their liquid vocal skill to rival their backing bands. It is a tradition that has been continued by the likes of Al Jarreau and Don’t Worry Be Happy singer Bobby McFerrin. In fact, the scat has never really left us: it lies dormant in the “-ella’’ of Rihanna’s Umbrella, in Jessie J’s chaotic, meme-ready vocal freestyles, and in the nightmarish refrain of Baby Shark. Ultimately, when you have the voice, who needs words and instruments anyway? \\n',\n",

       "  'full_article': \"Burberry has upgraded its full-year profit forecast after a rebound in sales since December, driven by a strong recovery in demand for its luxury goods in China and South Korea. In a rare piece of positive news from a fashion retail sector battered by the coronavirus crisis, Burberry said on Friday that like-for-like store retail sales would be up by nearly a third year on year in the first three months of 2021. The unscheduled trading update cheered investors, with Burberry’s share price up about 7% at lunchtime on Friday, its highest level since before the pandemic. “Since December, we have continued to see a strong rebound and now expect revenue and adjusted operating profit to be ahead of consensus expectations,” the company said. Burberry, known for its trench coats and distinctive patterned goods, said the performance upgrade is expected to lessen the overall decline in full-year revenues to 10%-11%. Analysts had forecast a fall of about 13%, according to Burberry.   Related: Burberry's European sales slump but Marcus Rashford ads widen appeal   The company, which has used stars such as the footballer Marcus Rashford to broaden the appeal of its collections to a younger market, said in January it had also seen strong demand from Chinese and Korean shoppers in the closing months of 2020. While sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa were down about 37%, said Burberry, on the back of store closures and fewer tourists, sales across the Asia Pacific market were up 11%. It again singled out China and South Korea as driving the recovery in sales. Burberry is operating with about 15% of its stores around the world closed and about a third under reduced trading hours or restrictions. Earlier this week, the Italian fashion house Prada and the luxury goods group Salvatore Ferragamo also said that strength in China had boosted sales this year.\\n\",\n",

       "  'title': 'Eurovision blocks Belarus entry from pro-Lukashenko band',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Eurovision has banned Belarus from entering a song to this year’s contest called I’ll Teach You, which appears to mock protesters who have taken to the streets against the dictator Alexander Lukashenko. The song, performed by the five-piece group Galasy ZMesta, was chosen by Belarus’s national broadcaster to compete in the Netherlands in May, rather than by a public vote as other entries have been in recent years. Galasy ZMesta have been vocal supporters of the Lukashenko regime, writing on their website that they “cannot remain indifferent” while protesters were “trying to break up the country we love and in which we live”. The frontman, Dmitry Butakov, a former military translator, has said he has a “Soviet” mentality and still finds it hard to accept the collapse of the USSR.   Related: Belarus jails two journalists who covered Lukashenko protest   Mass protests broke out in the former Soviet state last summer when Lukashenko, who has ruled Belarus with an iron fist for 26 years, claimed victory in a rigged election. At one point the demonstrations seemed set to topple the regime, but police responded with a violent crackdown, torturing arrested demonstrators and forcing opposition figures into exile. Butakov described the Russian-language song as satirical and said it did not address the protest movement openly. But the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which runs the competition, said there was a political undertone to lyrics such as “I’ll teach you to walk on a string / You will be happy and glad about everything … I will teach you toe the line”. In a statement, the EBU said it had “carefully scrutinised” the entry to ensure it complied with the rules of the rules of the competition, which bans political statements. “It was concluded that the song puts the non-political nature of the contest into question.” The EBU said Belarus would have to rewrite the song, find another entry, or face disqualification. The statement came as Belarusian officials said they had completed their investigation into Sergei Tikhanovsky, the husband of the opposition leader-in-exile Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, who was jailed last May after he announced his intention to stand against Lukashenko for the presidency. He faces up to 15 years behind bars on charges of inciting mass unrest, following the jailing of a number of other activists and journalists. I’ll Teach You is not the only entry to this year’s Eurovision Song Contest to have caused controversy. In Cyprus, the Orthodox church has demanded the country withdraw the song El Diablo by Elena Tsagrinou, which it said promoted Satanic worship. Russia’s selection of the Tajik-born singer Manizha to represent the country with Russian Woman, meanwhile, provoked a xenophobic backlash online, with some claiming a television vote had been rigged. Other conservative elements in Russia criticised Manizha’s support for LGBTQ rights. Songs have banned from Eurovision before because of political content. In 2009, shortly after a war with Russia, Georgia was blocked from entering We Don’t Wanna Put In, a barely veiled reference to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. Georgia refused to change the lyrics and withdrew from the competition.\\n',\n",

       "  'full_article': 'Producer Sonia Friedman and director Ian Rickson are to present a spring season of plays in the West End that will tackle “urgent issues integral to rebuilding our society”. The Re:Emerge season, announced on Friday, comprises dramas about structural inequality, the climate emergency and issues raised by the case of Anna Sorokin, the socialite who was found guilty of grand larceny after posing as an heiress. News of the three dramas, all written by up-and-coming playwrights and supported by Arts Council England, runs counter to any suggestions that the West End will bank on “safe” revivals when theatres reopen in May in line with the government’s roadmap. Friedman called it a season of “bold, new work for a bold, new world as we begin to build back to the full reopening of British theatre”.    J’Ouvert playwright Yasmin Joseph. Photograph: David M Benett/Getty Images   Gemma Arterton will star in Walden, by American playwright Amy Berryman, about the relationship between a Nasa botanist, her sister and a climate activist. It will be directed by Rickson, who is also artistic director for the season. Yasmin Joseph’s play J’Ouvert, which had an acclaimed run at Theatre503 in London in 2019, is set during the Notting Hill carnival and stars Gabrielle Brooks and Sapphire Joy as friends “navigating the joys and dangers of young black womanhood in 21st-century Britain”, said Friedman. It will be directed by Rebekah Murrell.  Anna X, written by Joseph Charlton, directed by Daniel Raggett and inspired by the Sorokin case, will star Emma Corrin – who rose to prominence after playing Diana in The Crown – in her professional stage debut. Previously performed at the Vault festival with a different cast, it delves into the “all-consuming lies we tell the world about ourselves over social media”, said Friedman. J’Ouvert is currently being filmed for the BBC’s Lights Up season of theatre productions and there are also plans to broadcast the other two plays. The Re:Emerge season will open to socially distanced audiences from May alongside Sonia Friedman Productions’ backstage farce The Comeback, created by double act The Pin (Alex Owen and Ben Ashenden), which features different guest stars at each performance. The Comeback opened at the Noël Coward theatre in London in December but was promptly closed by the national lockdown.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': \"Royal watchers say Harry and Meghan crisis must jolt 'the firm' towards change\",\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Four days after the Duke and Duchess of Sussex eviscerated the “the firm” with the sharp blade of “their truth”, Prince William had still not spoken to his brother. “But they just do not communicate in the way other families do,” said one veteran royal watcher. “You wonder if anyone has rung Harry.” According to one report, the Queen plans to personally offer an olive branch to the couple. She said in a statement this week that the extraordinarily damaging allegations from the Sussexes – of racism and of emotional neglect that Meghan said had left her feeling suicidal – would be dealt with privately. “That should be a holding statement,” said the royal historian and author Robert Lacey. “The next step is to say: yes, with regard to the personal family issues, we are working on that in private. But, we acknowledge there are issues of public accountability here.” It’s not just the aftermath of the Oprah Winfrey interview, Lacey said. Allegations that Meghan bullied staff are also in play. “This is about how this major institution of state, funded by the taxpayer, is actually organised. They should acknowledge: we have questions about HR policy. We have questions about our diversity. And we are going to handle those now, openly, in the way that any government department would. “This is an agency of the British government. It’s more than people or a family. It’s about an institution. If you look at Buckingham Palace’s website, at its HR pages, they go into ecstasy about their wonderful human resources policy, and what you can expect if you join, and how much they care for their staff. It sounds like any modern American corporation on paper. But in practice it’s just run in the old-fashioned way.” The phrase “the firm” has come to apply to the royal family and the institution around it – the “men in grey suits”, as Diana, Princess of Wales coined it. The power behind the royals include Sir Edward Young, the Queen’s private secretary, and Clive Alderton, a former diplomat and Prince Charles’s private secretary at Clarence House. Following the Sussexes’ claims of being marginalised within the institution, the spotlight is now on these figures as much as on the Queen, Charles and William – the latter making his thoughts clearly known when he told journalists: “We’re very much not a racist family.” How could they have failed to harness the potential of the campaigning, feminist Hollywood celebrity that was Meghan Markle, Lacey questioned. And now, it seems, according to another royal expert of longstanding, the narrative is set. “In a sense they have set the trajectory by not keeping the door ajar, not offering a way back in.” The couple were stung by the way Buckingham Palace framed their permanent departure last month, especially with its statement that by stepping away from the work of the royal family “it is not possible to continue with the responsibilities and duties that come with a life of public service”. It was badly worded, suggesting they could only do public service within the royal family, said Lacey. Yet Harry and Meghan had spent the last year trying to undertake public service. ‘That’s what the argument’s been all about,” said Lacey. “Those words seemed to misunderstand and misrepresent everything they had been trying to do in the best way.” The couple’s response was pointed and terse: “We can all live a life of service. Service is universal.” Friends of the Sussexes indicate they will have no more to say, that nothing was left unsaid. “I doubt there will be more, once you’ve had that level of interview,’ said one who knows them. They are “feeling free”, the actor Janina Gavankar, a close friend of Meghan, has said. She watched the Oprah interview. “Now they can get back to what they really were focused on,” she said of their humanitarian and environmental work through their Archewell charitable foundation. Both are expected, throughout this month, to promote their International Women’s Day campaign, which aims to “unleash a groundswell of real acts of compassion for the women in your life and in your community”, their website states. There is said to be relief – at having unburdened themselves, at getting it “over and done with” before they welcome their new daughter and become a family of four. Their profile in the US could not be higher. Support from celebrity friends has boosted the Meghan and Harry brand right across North America. Beyoncé posted: “Thank you Meghan for your courage and leadership. We are all strengthened and inspired by you.” Serena Williams wrote: “Meghan Markle, my selfless friend, lives her life – and leads by example – with empathy and compassion. She teaches me every day what it means to be truly noble.” “They [the Sussexes] should clearly shut up now,” Lacey said. “They have said that’s the end of it. Archewell is a positive innovation. They should get on with the doing, with less of the talking.” The tit-for-tat media briefings should cease, critics say. Media leaking between rival royals was on a scale not witnessed since the “war of the Waleses” between Charles and Diana. The fallout, however, is ongoing. “I think their biggest unexploded bomb is their bullying investigation,” said a royal watcher of long standing, referring to Buckingham Palace’s inquiry into the handling of claims of alleged bullying of staff by Meghan, the results of which it has said will be made public. “What are they going to do if people come forward and say ‘I was bullied by X royal, or X senior member of staff’? They will be desperate to keep as narrow a focus as possible. The risk is that it’s not a discrete matter about Meghan and Harry, but also about how staff reacted at Buckingham Palace and Clarence House. And why are they doing it in-house? Why is an independent person not doing it?” This crisis must jolt the institution towards change, said Lacey. Referring to the Queen’s words that “recollections may vary”, which implied questions over the couple’s account, was pointless, he said. “Harry and Meghan have created a new and disturbing truth, and one that the monarchy now has to live with,” he said.\\n',\n",

The Chelsea manager, Emma Hayes will be hoping to overcome last year’s runners-up at the fourth time of asking, having been eliminated by the German side in 2016, 2017 and 2018. Meanwhile, City will play Barcelona for the first time, having been knocked out by Atlético Madrid last year and the preceding season.   Related: Manchester United's Casey Stoney says WSL is 'very white and has to change'   Chelsea progressed to the last eight at the expense of Atlético. The west London side shrugged off the dismissal of the stand-in centre-back Sophie Ingle in the 12th minute of the first leg to earn a 2-0 win at Kingsmeadow, with Ann-Katrin Berger saving two penalties. In the second leg Maren Mjelde opened the scoring from the spot moments after Atlético’s Toni Duggan had crashed a penalty against the crossbar. A last-minute goal from the substitute Emelyne Laurent earned Atleti a draw on the day but it was not enough to stop Chelsea from going through. City thrashed Fiorentina 8-0 over two legs to earn their place among the final eight, with Ellen White and Sam Mewis scoring three each across the two games. Gareth Taylor’s team have not reached the quarter-final stage since their semi-final exit to Lyon in 2018, while Chelsea were knocked out by the French side at the same stage in 2019. The French side have won the past five tournaments. Should Manchester City progress, they would play the winner of the game between Sparta Prague or PSG and Lyon.

       "  'title': 'Bullring and Brent Cross mall owner must sell more properties to survive Covid crisis',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Hammerson, owner of the Bullring and Brent Cross shopping centres, has warned it will need to sell more of its property empire to survive the coronavirus crisis, after reporting a record £1.7bn loss for 2020. The property group, which also owns the Bicester Village designer outlet, said the closure of non-essential shops during lockdowns and the suspension of rent payments for struggling retailers in 2020 fuelled the biggest annual fall in rental income in company history. Annual losses more than doubled from £781m in 2019 to £1.7bn last year. “As our results show, Hammerson was hit hard,” said Rita-Rose Gagne, the Hammerson chief executive. “Our immediate focus in 2021 is leading Hammerson through Covid-19 to safety. This means further disposals to strengthen the balance sheet, managing refinancing, and sharpening our operations to maximise income.” The value of its property portfolio plunged by almost £2bn, another record fall – from £8.32bn to £6.33bn – including a 36% decline across its flagship UK retail destinations. The company said part of the decline in the value of its portfolio was also due to the sale of some assets. Net rental income fell 41% to £157.6m, prompted by store closures, tenant restructuring deals and higher provisions for bad debt and tenant incentives. So far Hammerson has collected 76% of 2020 rent due. Earlier this week, the government extended a ban on evicting commercial tenants until the end of June, which landlords have said makes it harder to collect rent from those that can pay but do not. The company said it has made £73m selling minority stakes in Brent South Shopping Park and two French joint ventures. The news of the latest disposals satisfied investors, pushing Hammerson’s share price up nearly 5% by lunchtime on Friday to 34p. However, the share price has fallen more than 50% in the past year. The longer-term outlook remains less certain. “We are currently working on a thorough strategic and organisational review that will map out a route to future growth and transform the business in the context of what will remain a tough economic and structural backdrop,” said Gagne, who was made CEO in November.   Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk   “Hammerson provides the places and social infrastructure where people want and need to be, and I am confident it will have a vital role in shaping neighbourhoods and communities in the future.” The business has been battling to cut its debt burden. In 2020 it reduced its £2.2bn debt by £609m, after raising more than £800m over the past year through the sale of assets and a rights issue. Robert Duncan, an analyst at Numis, said investors would be “disappointed” that Hammerson’s new management have not yet completed a strategic review of the business. “Today’s results were never about the earnings performance … it was never in doubt that 2020 was going to be one of the toughest years on record,” said Duncan, in a note to investors. “But rather [it was] about any proposed changes the new CEO intended to make to group strategy. On that basis, the market will likely be disappointed as, despite having joined the group in November, the strategic review remains ongoing. In our view, this is a missed opportunity.” Hammerson is taking action to try to avoid the same fate as its rival Intu Properties, whose shopping malls include Lakeside in Essex, the Trafford Centre in Manchester and Gateshead’s Metrocentre. Intu collapsed into administration in June after the heavily indebted group failed to reach an agreement with its creditors. Hammerson hopes to reopen its portfolio of malls, retail parks and designer outlets by mid-April.\\n',\n",

       "  'full_article': \"Jason Holder earned widespread praise in the UK last summer after leading the first international cricket tour during the Covid-19 pandemic. But the all-rounder has now been stood down as Test captain of West Indies and replaced by Kraigg Brathwaite. Holder, 29, was one of 10 West Indies players who opted out of a tour of Bangladesh last month because of Covid-related concerns, only for Brathwaite, his vice-captain and fellow Bajan, to then steward the understrength side to a famous 2-0 away victory.   Related: Kyle Mayers' 210 on debut gives West Indies stunning win over Bangladesh   That campaign, one sparked by the debutant Kyle Mayers compiling a match-winning 210 not out in the first Test in Chittagong, has prompted Cricket West Indies to opt for a permanent change of leadership, ending Holder’s five and a half years in the job. Roger Harper, lead selector for West Indies, said: “We all believe that Kraigg is the right man to lead our Test side at this point in time and I’m delighted that he has accepted the role. In the recent Test series against Bangladesh, Kraigg was able to motivate his players to play to a very high level and create the culture we are looking to establish where the team showed a collective determination to fight and a real hunger for success.”    Jason Holder (second left) celebrates with John Campbell after West Indies beat England in the first Test at the Ageas Bowl on 12 July 2020. Photograph: Adrian Dennis/AP   After being appointed as the youngest captain of West Indies back in 2015, aged 23 and with just eight caps to his name by that stage, Holder led the team to 11 wins and 21 defeats during his 37 Tests in charge. A 2-1 defeat of England in the Caribbean in early 2019 was arguably the highlight of his four series victories. This was dwarfed in the eyes of many by the return series last year, however, when Holder brought his West Indies side over to England for the first Test cricket played in a biosecure environment despite financial constraints seeing the players forced to take a 50% pay cut on their central contracts.

Though they eventually lost the series 2-1, West Indies won the opener in Southampton thanks to Holder’s figures of six for 42 in the first innings, while the all-rounder – ranked No 1 in the world currently – also spoke with calm authority as the two sides marked the global Black Lives Matter movement by taking a knee before matches.

       "  'full_article': 'The Hastings Contemporary gallery opened nine years ago as a home for British contemporary art, but now the doors are closed. The exhibitions are still up, but the galleries are silent and still. One member of staff may occasionally be walking around the black-tiled building that looks out on to The Stade, a shingle beach on the Channel. But there’s something else moving through the space and focusing on the artwork. It’s a telepresence robot. Visitors can’t currently come to the gallery – so the gallery is taking the art to the visitors. “When you have to close your doors to the public, that’s a disaster,” says Liz Gilmore, the gallery’s director. “Our audiences and the art are the heartbeat of everything [we do].”    Hastings Contemporary gallery director Liz Gilmore.

Since April 2020, Gilmore says, they have given hundreds of the half-hour tours. It’s one of the many innovative ways of dealing with the drastic changes brought about by the pandemic. The cultural sector has been one of the hardest hit by Covid-19: the arts and entertainment industry saw a 44.5% reduction in GDP in the second quarter of 2020, according to the Office for National Statistics. Institutions of all sizes have suffered, as have individual arts workers, many of whom have been made redundant, lost funding or seen freelance income dry up.    Inside the Hastings Contemporary.

It’s now possible to attend a workshop at London’s V&A during the day and then a lecture at Museums & Galleries Edinburgh in the evening – all online. Hastings Contemporary’s robot has been a big hit, with people from the US, Canada, Australia, Switzerland and Dubai attending tours, which resemble a Zoom call with a tour guide. The groups are small, to allow for questions and interaction.    Hastings Contemporary’s robot guide. (Image courtesy of Hastings Contemporary and Quentin Blake). Photograph: Alun Callender/Guardian   “That’s been one of the really great things about it,” says Gilmore. “People can meet other people, as well as looking at the exhibitions we have on show. It’s empowering, and shows the genuine need for connection that people have at this point of isolation.” The gallery had been mulling over the robot idea for some time; pre-pandemic, they had been thinking about how they could connect with children in a local hospice. “One of our trustees, Esther Fox, an incredible artist and a wheelchair user, wondered if we might offer robot tours,” says Gilmore. “She knew the benefits of being transported somewhere you wouldn’t physically be able to get to.” When the pandemic hit, they pressed fast-forward on the project. Fast-track adaptation has also been the watchword for artists Ruth Gibson and Bruno Martelli. Producing multidisciplinary art under the name Gibson/Martelli, the London-based duo have worked together for more than 20 years, exhibiting at the likes of the Barbican Centre, the Venice Biennale and the Detroit Institute of Arts. “We were lucky in some ways, as our studio space is in our house, so we were able to keep working,” says Martelli. The pandemic did, however, force them to make changes to a big project they had been working on for some time. Dazzle – inspired by the Dazzle ball, thrown in 1919 at the Royal Albert Hall – was meant to combine moving images, dance, sound art, fashion and virtual reality. Audience members, wearing virtual reality (VR) headsets, would be immersed in the event; while alongside avatars of performers, they would then feel a dancer – present in the physical space – touch them. But, despite the heavy use of digital technology, the project also relied on people occupying the same space, and costumes and headsets being worn by multiple attendees. Although Gibson/Martelli hope to create Dazzle in full in the future, they have meanwhile found a pandemic-ready solution: art show as computer game. “It’s similar technology to a multiplayer first-person shooter game,” says Martelli. “If you are the audience member at home, you get a ticket, download the software, put the headset on, go into VR – where you could also meet your friends – and have the experience.”    Ruth Gibson and Bruno Martelli Photograph: No Credit    Ruth Gibson and Bruno Martelli  Partly funded by UK Research and Innovation, the Dazzle project was conceived as part of CreativeXR, a programme developed by Arts Council England and tech innovation centre Digital Catapult to support the creation of cultural experiences using immersive technology. But the reality of the pandemic also means the two artists needed to consider the human element more than ever. “We’ve been really conscious of keeping everyone that’s working on the project. It’s hard for people like dancers, there’s not a tonne of work around,” says Martelli. They have also had performers help out in other areas, such as dealing with administration. For Hastings Contemporary, the robot and the attention it has generated has also provided a boost. Gilmore notes she’s very grateful to be able to offer something to members who have continued paying their subscription fees throughout the pandemic. “Because the robot was partially funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council, we weren’t in a position where we wanted to charge for the tours at this pilot stage,” she says. “But we are interested in how all galleries might be able to monetise this and develop an income stream.”    Gibson/Martelli’s Dazzle project is available in VR Photograph: Courtesy of THAYAHT (6)    Gibson/Martelli’s Dazzle project is available in virtual reality  Gilmore hopes that robot tours could be a fun experience for families or friends who can’t be together physically, but also that, post-pandemic, they will be a way for people who can’t get to the gallery for reasons of physical or mental health to be able to experience art. Both Hastings Contemporary and Gibson/Martelli have created ways of interacting with art that will outlast lockdown. At this stage, though, there is still a need for one member of the gallery’s staff to accompany the robot. “It can glide on a flat surface, but not exactly with balletic grace,” says Gilmore. “And it still can’t use the lift. We need a human to press the button.” The British Business Bank is a government-owned economic development bank, helping thousands of businesses across the UK access the financial information and support that they need to get back on track.

       "  'title': 'From DIY kits to sustainable bespoke furniture: meet the businesses reshaping interior design',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'The past year has seen most of us spend more time at home than ever before, meaning that optimising our living spaces is at the front of our minds. But redesigning the interior of a home isn’t just about changing the colour of the walls or moving furniture into new positions. It’s also about the finer details – the grain in wood, the feeling when you sit down in a chair, how fabric feels under your fingers or how light falls through a window. Interior designers have to take into consideration a whole range of factors that make all the difference when it comes to spending time in a room. Given this, the digital video meetings we’ve all become used to can only take a designer so far. Nonetheless, the sector itself is proving resilient; eight out of 10 people, according to a survey conducted by the Royal Institute of British Architects (Riba) in October, wanted to change their homes as soon as it was safe to do so. “The impact of Covid-19 will affect how and where we choose to live for years to come,” says Riba president Alan Jones. “For many of us, our homes are our sanctuaries, and this research indicates that many people are keener than ever to adapt and improve their homes.” Many interior designers across the UK report an increase in the number of new clients they have taken on. But as the process relies so heavily on being physically present in a space, they have had to adapt.    Zoe Hewett Photograph: Emli Bendixen          Bristol-based designer Zoe Hewett: ‘Creating nice places is what drives me’  Zoe Hewett is no stranger to finding creative ways around problems. When she first started her interior design business, Stylemongers of Bristol, the former set designer for theatre and TV productions lacked the funds to make over her own home to serve as a showcase – so instead she built a doll’s house to demonstrate her style. As a result of the pandemic, Hewett scaled back her face-to-face work, but has still found ways of expanding her business – one of which is a range of interior design kits to help people design their own homes. “At first, I was thinking about making my services accessible,” she says. “A one-to-one design consultation is worth doing for a bespoke service, but it’s always going to be out of reach for some people, so I wanted to offer something affordable, at a price point more people could afford.” The pandemic meant the project became a priority for her business, and the packs became a reality. “I may have created an envelope-stuffing role for myself,” she says. “But I love that people are getting something physical and tangible to work with.”     Hewett’s interior design kits have proved popular  The packs are made of recycled card and paper and are delivered in letterbox-sized packages. Hewett sees them as a way of sharing the information and techniques that she previously discussed in face-to-face workshops, where she would guide groups through the principles of interior design – from creating moodboards to where to place furniture. They contain, among other things, quizzes to help buyers explore design choices, advice on using colour and materials to create 2D-scale layouts of rooms, plus a link to an ebook with further information. Hewett says the take-up of the £50 kits has been “pretty good. I hope people find them fun as well as useful. One lady who bought one said she’s using it again with her seven-year-old to reimagine their shed. Her daughter’s got really into it, apparently.” Hewett – who has recently taken part in a new BBC Two show, My Unique B&B, where a team of designers make over glamping spaces – was able to move some of her consultation work online: “Before [the pandemic] hit, I had made a secret area of my website where people can download a questionnaire, to fill in and send back with photos,” she says. “I initially put it in place because I’m a Send (special educational needs and disabilities) parent, so it was about being able to work around appointments or needing to do school pickups at the drop of a hat. In that way, I was already geared up to keep working when lockdown hit.” From each commission, Hewett makes a donation to the homeless charity Crisis. “Creating nice places is what drives me,” she says. “So it makes sense to me to also help people who haven’t got anywhere to live yet.”    Liselle Milner. Photograph: Ben Mostyn/Guardian    Liselle Milner has a focus on using sustainable materials and secondhand or upcycled furniture  The community focus is also important to Liselle Milner of Zenterior Design, based in St Austell, Cornwall. She works with 12 others, including builders, carpenters and upholsterers, to create indoor and outdoor spaces and bespoke furniture, all with a focus on using sustainable materials. Much of her work involves second homes or holiday lets, so the owners have not been able to travel to meet her. “We’ve always focused on the relationship with the client, getting an idea of exactly what it is they want and then making that happen, so to never meet someone face-to-face has been very odd,” she says. “Although, if you are talking to someone via Zoom, there is the advantage of seeing their house in the background, so it’s a very quick way of seeing what they already like.” Milner uses a lot of secondhand or upcycled furniture – “I want the space to look as amazing as possible for the budget we have” – but her pre-pandemic visits to charity shops and auctions have been replaced by Facebook Marketplace, and ever-greater resourcefulness as a team.    The beach at St Austell. Photograph: Ben Mostyn/Guardian          Many of the properties Milner works on are second homes or holiday lets  “We’re looking at things we would usually outsource, like quilting, for example, and thinking: ‘Can we do that ourselves?’” she says. “It’s good creatively, and it also means we can keep to a schedule. Big furniture retailers have set specifics they work to. If a piece is made of oak, and if the oak isn’t there, then that sofa won’t be with you in 12 weeks’ time. But if we are making it, then we can use beech or another suitable wood that we can actually get hold of.” Besides changing their ways of working to comply with pandemic-related restrictions, such as visiting sites individually instead of together, the Zenterior team have also adapted some of the other physical parts of their jobs, finding ways to keep to social distancing rules, and have stopped working on occupied domestic properties. Milner has also doubled down on Zenterior’s commitment to using local suppliers, not only to avoid delays with supply chains but also from a sense of local responsibility, as the regional tourism sector has been hit especially hard by restrictions on movement. “And there’s also the fact that Cornwall has always been a hub for artists and creative people. It makes sense to work with people who are here,” says Milner. The pandemic may have affected their traditional ways of working for now, but both Milner and Hewett are determined that its lasting effects on our homes are sustainably positive.

       "  'title': 'Hollywood Down Under: stars flock from US to film in Covid-free Australia ',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'On a warmish Wednesday evening early in the year, Paul Mescal was celebrating his birthday and everybody seemed to know. The Irish actor, famous for his neckchain and his leading role in Normal People, was in Sydney, Australia, for a new film, and the word was spreading. He was photographed running in Centennial Park. He was sighted at Tamarama Beach. He popped into an inner-city pub. But on the list of stars now working in Australia, Mescal – in Sydney for a musical film adaptation of Carmen – is comfortably mid-level. Thanks to its relative freedom from Covid-19 and associated restrictions, Australia – blessed with diverse locations, sunny weather and a ready-made film infrastructure – has become Hollywood Down Under. Here for the latest instalment of Marvel’s Thor franchise are Natalie Portman, Matt Damon, Tessa Thompson, Chris Pratt, Christian Bale, the New Zealand director Taika Waititi and the Australian star Chris Hemsworth. Fellow Australian Isla Fisher and her husband, Sacha Baron Cohen, have relocated their family to Sydney, where the pair first met 20 years ago. Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban came back too. Idris Elba and Tilda Swinton were in the country earlier in the year to film Three Thousand Years of Longing. Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson just wrapped in Queensland for the sitcom Young Rock. Zac Efron moved for the lifestyle first, then let the projects follow. When the news came on Wednesday that George Clooney and Julia Roberts would soon be joining their peers in the sun, the film’s title was as apt as A Star is Born, as subtle as Sharknado. It’s called Ticket to Paradise. ‘Like a time machine’ The areas that these stars flock to – Byron Bay, Queensland’s Gold Coast, Sydney – are beach-fringed and beautiful. They are also Covid-free. New South Wales, the most populous state in Australia, has gone 54 days without a community-acquired case of the virus, and Queensland has racked up 64. California, meanwhile, recorded 3,518 new cases on Thursday and 268 deaths.     Byron Bay, New South Wales. Photograph: Peter Harrison/Getty Images   Many of the stars have quarantined in luxury mansions or rolling country estates, with special exemptions that let them skip the hotels and state police and instead hire private security to enforce their isolation. As of this month, Efron was living in a “luxurious yet dated” four-bedroom property in the “Spanish-mission style” in Sydney, according to the Sydney Morning Herald. Damon, when he arrived in January, reportedly spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on private doctors, hospital-grade cleaning and guards, and issued a public statement saying he was determined to help keep Covid out and maintain Australia’s reputation as “the lucky country”. As Broadway shows shuttered and the studios of Hollywood lay under lock and key, filming in Australia has been a surreal experience for both sides of the equation. Portman told the chatshow host Jimmy Kimmel that Australia was “like a time-machine”, an alien, upside down world where “all the trees are different” and “there’s multicoloured parrots flying around like pigeons”.    File photo of George Clooney and Julia Roberts at Cannes in 2016. Photograph: Jean-Paul Pélissier/Reuters   On the Gold Coast, state-of-the-art film studios are hosting Clooney and Roberts for their romcom, and the nearby hinterland will stand in for Thailand’s Chiang Rai province. In Sydney, Waititi has been filming the Marvel epic seemingly everywhere – at Fox Studios, at Centennial Park and on golf courses. For many residents, the frenzy has focused on the mundanity of faraway stars caught in the middle of everyday Australian life. A shot of the cast of Thor holding an umbrella from Bunnings Warehouse, a beloved Australian home and garden emporium, sent many minds into overdrive. Paparazzi shots of Portman wielding a trolley on an escalator at a shopping centre were treated like modern art.  Look I’m generally against the idea of the paparazzi but I feel in 2020 we deserve little photos of American celebrities embracing their newfound inner Australian Normcore (Natalie Portman in Woolies / Zac Efron in Rundle St Mall) pic.twitter.com/pk6IpfUV7t— Sam Twyford-Moore (@samtwyfordmoore) November 17, 2020  “Natalie Portman stocks up on a trolley full of vegetables,” was the headline in the Daily Mail Australia, with the simplicity of a Raymond Carver short story. “Natalie Portman and I buy the same brand of hummus from woolies,” said one Twitter user. The list of big projects filming in Sydney is long. Another Marvel film, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, starring Simu Liu and Awkwafina, recently wrapped up. And there are even more in the pipeline. Melissa McCarthy is filming a Netflix comedy, God’s Favourite Idiot, in regional New South Wales, while Ron Howard is shooting a film about the Thai cave rescue, called Thirteen Lives, in Queensland. Blacklight, a racing film starring Liam Neeson, tore through the wide and frequently empty streets of Canberra, the nation’s “bush capital”, in January. Under the cover of night, expensive black Porsches were smashed together at high velocity below the Majura Parkway. The Canberra Times reported that the producers loved the “quiet streets, nondescript cityscape and efficient approval processes”. Rather optimistically it declared this “[gave] hope to some the ACT [Australian Capital Territory] could be the new LA”. But from the US west coast to the Australian east, one thing has remained constant. When Hemsworth, Damon, Cohen and Fisher dined together in Sydney’s eastern suburbs on Thursday, the paparazzi and gossip columnists were there waiting. As he left, Hemsworth had a particularly Australian message for them: “See ya, dickheads.” \\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'Is the Sarah Everard vigil ban part of creeping curbs on the right to protest?',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Organisers of a vigil for Sarah Everard are seeking a court order to assert their right to protest after the Metropolitan police reversed their position on allowing the event to go ahead. The possible challenge comes at a time of mounting concern about the police and the government using the pandemic to curtail the right to protest. In normal times, what is the right to protest? Assembling with other people for a common purpose is considered a cornerstone of democracy. This right to protest is protected by the Human Rights Act under articles on freedom of expression and freedom of assembly. The police have a duty to uphold these individual rights and must take steps to enable peaceful protests. But the right to protest is a qualified right not an absolute one, which means the authorities can restrict it if they can show their action is proportionate and in the public interest. Do the coronavirus rules ban protests? The ban on meeting up with more than one other person outside, and previous limits on the numbers allowed to gather, appears to represent a blanket ban on organising or taking part in protests. This has never been tested in court, so the law is unclear. What powers can the police use to stop protests? Under the coronavirus regulations, the police can issue a fine of £10,000 for anyone organising a gathering of more than 30 people in a public place. Dozens of such fines have been issued in the past few months for people organising parties, raves and protests. The police can also issue fixed-penalty notices to anyone taking part in such gatherings. What happened during last summer’s Black Lives Matter protests? The killing of George Floyd by American police prompted tens of thousands of people to take to the streets in the UK in support of black people’s rights. Hundreds of people were arrested during the demonstrations and many were subjected to police tactics such as kettling. The home secretary, Priti Patel, claimed many people taking part were “thugs and criminals”, and she told parliament that the demonstrations were illegal. What is Reclaim These Streets? It is a campaign group that wants to hold a gathering on Clapham Common and a minute of silence to remember Sarah Everard and all women lost to violence. It describes itself as a “group of women who wanted to channel the collective grief, outrage and sadness in our community”. Is it allowed to hold the vigil? Initially the Met told the group it was “trying to navigate a way” to allow the vigil to take place. But on Thursday the police said the planned gathering would be unlawful and their “hands [were] tied” by Covid regulations. After a crowdfunding campaign, human rights lawyers acting for the group challenged this interpretation of the rules. They are seeking a high court order confirming that the Met’s understanding of the law is wrong. Does the government want to curtail the right to protests? Human rights campaigners say yes. They are concerned that ministers are using the pandemic as a pretext to severely weaken the right to protest. They are particularly alarmed by this week’s police, crime, sentencing and courts bill, which would give the home secretary power to create laws to define “serious disruption” that police could then use to impose conditions on protests. These fears were underlined when plans for policing protests outlined the “need to develop” covert intelligence methods, and cited the use of facial recognition technology – despite a ruling that this breached privacy rights.\\n',\n",

       "  'full_article': 'My father, Robin Wendt, who has died aged 80, had a long and distinguished career in central and local government, including as a senior civil servant, chief executive of a county council and head of two bodies representing local authorities.He was born in Preston into a Methodist family. His father, Bill, was a local government accountant and his mother, Doris (nee Glover), was a schoolteacher. Educated at Hutton Grammar school and Wadham College, Oxford, where he studied PPE, in 1962 Robin joined the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance, which later became the Department of Health and Social Security (DHSS). During those early days in London, he met Prue Dalby, a photographer, at Hinde Street Methodist church in Marylebone, and they married in 1965. Robin became principal private secretary to the Labour social services secretary Richard Crossman and, in the civil service tradition, also to his Conservative successor, Keith Joseph, after the 1970 general election. He subsequently rose to be assistant secretary at the DHSS. In 1975 he moved to become deputy secretary at Cheshire county council, taking promotion to chief executive four years later at the age of 38 and skilfully helping to guide the authority during a period when no party had overall control. When he returned to work in London in 1989 as secretary and de facto chief executive of the Association of County Councils, he steered the ACC through a turbulent period, helping to counter suggestions in a local authority review that county councils should be abolished in favour of creating smaller unitary authorities.  He was appointed CBE in 1996, and when the ACC merged with its counterparts for metropolitan and district councils to form the new Local Government Association in 1997, Robin joined the National Association of Local Councils – representing parish and town councils – as its chief executive for two years before taking early retirement. Settling back in Cheshire, where he had been appointed deputy lieutenant in 1990, Robin threw himself into a host of local causes, and chaired the Chester summer music festival for eight years to 2008. He also served as a member of the Royal Commission on Long-term Care for the Elderly at the end of the 1990s, as a board member of the charity Action for Children (1997 to 2008) and as a member of the Social Security Advisory Committee for 20 years to 2002.  Robin and Prue enjoyed travel to far-flung destinations, including Antarctica, but he was never happier than when at home, reading political biographies while listening to classical music and following the fortunes of Preston North End football club and Lancashire’s county cricketers. He was also a frequent contributor to the Guardian letters page, often on the subject of the values of public service. He is survived by Prue, and by their children, Julia and me, and grandchildren, James, Lucy and Oscar.\\n',\n",

       "  'full_article': 'We may not be able to travel, and spring may be within touching distance, but the fantasy of alpine glamour has never been stronger in the fashion world. This week, Lady Gaga posted a photo from the set of her forthcoming film, House of Gucci, directed by Ridley Scott and inspired by the true story of fashion’s grisliest power couple. In the on-set photo, captioned “Mr and Mrs Gucci”, Lady Gaga wears a white fur hat and is draped in gold jewellery, while her co-star, Adam Driver, wears a cable-knit jumper and oversized glasses. Against the backdrop of a snowcapped mountain, they are the epitome of fashion’s latest obsession: ski-core. Lockdown has inspired a very glamorous sort of Fomo (fear of missing out) with fashion labels such as Louis Vuitton, Chanel and Miu Miu conceptualising their autumn/winter collections on-piste. Beyoncé also channelled her inner snow queen in advertising for the Ivy Park x Adidas collection.    Richard Burton and Liz Taylor on a winter sports holiday in the 1960s. Photograph: James Andanson/Sygma/Getty   Thom Browne has put the former Olympic skier Lindsey Vonn front and centre of his snowcapped, gender-neutral collection for autumn/winter 21 (a fantasia of The Wizard of Oz on ice) and Eudon Choi’s new collection is inspired by Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton’s Gstaad getaway – Chalet Ariel – which played host to Jackie Kennedy and Marlene Dietrich. “I loved the idea of Elizabeth Taylor entertaining her glamorous guests at Chalet Ariel in Gstaad,” said Choi. “Apparently she was a great hostess and her après-ski parties were legendary. The chalet was also her place of escape when she was one of the most famous women in the world and [offered her] that sense of retreat.”   Related: Paris fashion week autumn/winter 2021: key shows – in pictures   Choi said that being in lockdown got him dreaming. “I guess when we can’t travel, we dream of the places we have always wanted to visit,” he said. “My own ongoing desire for escapism has become central to my creative process during the pandemic.” Indeed, the over-the-top, luxury of the vintage ski jetset fits into fashion’s current aesthetic for fantastic nostalgia. Historically, skiing wasn’t always the home of timeless glamour. It was only after alpine skiing debuted at the Olympics in 1936 as a standalone event that skiwear went from lumpen to more streamlined. Dior and Pucci created sports lines around the same time, and ski labels such as Bogner, which began in 1932, also launched.    The former Olympic skier Lindsey Vonn wears Thom Browne autumn/winter 2021. Photograph: Lindsey Vonn   The ski looks in 2021 reference not onlyElizabeth Taylor and Veruschka in the 1960s, but also 70s brands such as Spyder and neon-coloured 80s ski trends. Ski-core also ties into our need to embrace outdoor clothes as fashion items, when lockdown allows socialising outside again, exemplified by the North Face puffer jacket – searches for which grew by 243% between November and February of this year, according to Lyst. “With the great outdoors becoming the UK’s gym and social hangout, cold-weather products have a more versatile lease of life,” said Emily Bezzant, vice-president of research and analysis at Edited. “More ski-related products sold out during 2020 than 2019.”     A Dior ski jacket, autumn/winter 2020. Photograph: Dior   Chelsea Power, a senior buyer at Matchesfashion, agreed. “Items that offer comfort, warmth and style have been extremely popular,” she said. “Ski brands have the technical ability to provide all these features.” The effortless glamour of skiing is something we all might be craving in what we hope may turn into the roaring 20s. “I do think that once this is all over people will want to get out and celebrate,” said Choi. “I guess when we can’t travel, we dream of the places we have always wanted to visit.” \\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'Cast out: the Yazidi women reunited with their children born in Isis slavery',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Bundled up in oversized scarves and coats, and squirming over lounge chairs, the 12 young children seemed startled as nine strange women with outstretched arms hurried towards them. Some of the women sobbed as they embraced the bemused toddlers, who stared at them blankly not recognising their mothers, or understanding what the fuss was about. One mother stood motionless with her head in her hands, while another stared intently into her tiny daughter’s eyes. The nine mothers, all members of the Yazidi community, and their children, all born to the terrorists who enslaved them, had been reunited for the first time since the collapse of Islamic State in early 2019. And after two years of preparing for such a moment, the women were about to make the most momentous decisions of their lives. The extraordinary scenes at the Iraq-Syria border crossing last Thursday were the culmination of months of lobbying by officials, including from the Biden administration, protracted debates among the Yazidi community and the determination of young mothers cruelly stripped of the children born to them to reclaim what was theirs, no matter the price.    A Yazidi woman who decided to reunite with her daughter in defiance of her community shows a necklace she bought the previous day as a gift for her. Photograph: Achilleas Zavallis/The Guardian   Each of the women had used an excuse to slip away from their family. The last time most of them had been at Samalka, they had been rescued from the giant al-Hol refugee camp in eastern Syria where the remnants of Isis’s collapsed so-called caliphate were collected. The Yazidi were allowed to return to Iraq, but their children were seized from them before the border and taken to an orphanage. Yazidi elders had since refused to allow the children to join their mothers. To the community, the children were outcasts who ccould never be assimilated into Yazidi society. The unwritten reckoning was that if the mothers chose their children, they would need to forgo their community. Until last week, it appeared unlikely that the women, all aged between 19 and 26, would ever be able to make such a decision. The children had been banned from entering Iraq and only a few mothers had been able to enter Syria on day passes to visit the orphanage. Then came a convergence of people and circumstances, which made the seemingly impossible suddenly doable. Nemam Ghafouri, an organiser of the Yazidi mothers and the founder of Joint Help for Kurdistan, an NGO, received a phone call from the former US diplomat and long-term contact of Kurds on both sides of the border, Peter Galbraith. The Syrian Kurds were prepared to do a deal, he told her, and he was flying to Erbil to make it happen. Galbraith had worked on the Senate foreign relations committee for 14 years and has been a friend of Joe Biden since 1980. Like him, the new US president had taken an interest in Kurdish issues. The calculation on both sides of the border was that doing business on an issue such as this might pave the way for more extensive reengagement after the turmoil of the Trump years.  map  “I asked Nechirvan Barzani [the president of the Kurdish regional government] to talk to Mazloum Abdi [the commander of the Syrian Democratic Forces] and he agreed,” he said. After fraught discussions throughout Wednesday during which Galbraith called the White House to secure the transfer, Syrian Kurdish officials bundled the 12 children – who could all be definitively linked to the nine mothers waiting for them – into a minibus, and headed for the border. Ghafouri, who had been waiting with the mothers in a hotel, brought them to the border, and waited. In the following hours, officials in Kurdish Iraq demanded to know the provenance of the children, before clearing the mothers to reclaim them.  The women had been enslaved in their early teens from the community of Sinjar, which bore the brunt of the Isis genocide, and had stayed with the group throughout its rise and fall. Some of the mothers did not know who the fathers of their children were. “People need to realise why some of these women have such bonds with their babies,” said Ghafouri. “When they got pregnant, it meant the end of selling and raping by new men. This child brought an end to part of their suffering. Once being pregnant and giving birth, it was the end of it. The mother stayed with one man until he was killed.” By midnight last Thursday, the mothers were on their way to a prearranged safe house.    One of the children who was reunited with her mother. Photograph: Family Handout   But news of the reunions has been met with anger by leaders of the Yazidi community. “We don’t accept this. This should be a Yazidi nation decision,” said Prince Herman, a representative of the senior Yazidi leader Prince Hazem. “The mothers are always welcome to come back home, but the children are not accepted. They can give their children to whomever they want, but they cannot live with us. “Those people who brought back those children without asking Yazidis, or Yazidi leaders, will pay the price for what they did. There is no difference between those missionary NGOs and Isis, because they are playing with our girls and taking them from us. The Yazidi spiritual leader, Sheikh Ali Ilyas, otherwise known as Bab Sheikh, said the women were now exiled. “Neither me or the Yazidi community will accept those children,” he said. “They are free to go wherever they want, except our community. They are no longer our issue and are free to make their own decisions.” In the safehouse, raucous sounds of children playing echo over two floors. Eight mothers have moved into the house, with one returning to her family in a refugee camp. Those who stayed have crossed the Rubicon, and are now looking for relocation to Europe or Australia. “I wasn’t sure what I’d do until I saw my daughter again,” said one of the mothers. “I love my mother a lot and know what this means for me. But I love my daughter too. I want a new start.” A second mother said she was overwhelmed by the support she had felt over the past week and now realised she needed to cut ties with her society. “I have family living abroad, and even they won’t accept me. This has to change, and we’re going to make it happen. When I told my parents, they said ‘you are no longer a member of our family’. “I am very happy that I am with her. At first she didn’t recognise me, but it’s getting better day by day. When I came back after being separated, and I realised the community wasn’t accepting us, I decided to make my life my daughter. Children are innocent. They haven’t made any mistakes.” Yazidis have been granted resettlement in Europe and elsewhere, but the issue of children born to Isis remains vexed for governments. “They have no safe place not only in Iraq but in the entire Middle East,” said Ghafouri. “The only thing they want is to be resettled as a group in a third country. This has been an infected wound for the Yazidi community. The only healing is reuniting those mothers who want their children and resettle them. “We need to find solutions now. I don’t necessarily blame Yazidi communities or Kurdish communities in either Iraq or Syria, but I do blame the UN and the international community. They are victims again being victimised by those people saying they are supporting them, but not doing anything.” Additional reporting by Barzan Salam\\n',\n",

       "  'full_article': 'My friend Anne Suddick, who has died aged 72 of heart failure, was a passionate coordinator of support for miners’ families in County Durham during the 1984-85 national miners’ strike. She worked hard to make sure families did not go hungry during the strike, was a founder member of Women Against Pit Closures in 1984, and was active in the National Justice for Mineworkers campaign for many years. Anne was born in East Hedley Hope, County Durham, to John Suddick, a labourer, and his wife, Violet (nee Goodliff). Anne’s childhood was shaped by her father’s ill health from a respiratory illness. Cast as the main breadwinner, her mother became housekeeper to a GP in Cornsay Colliery, Durham. Living in the doctor’s home, with access to an extensive library, Anne developed a love of learning that stayed with her. She left school at 15 and took a secretarial course at Durham Technical College. Initially she went to work as a clerk at a local garage but in 1969 she became PA to the union officials of the Durham Colliery Mechanics’ Association, part of the National Union of Mineworkers. Following the death of her sister, Jean, after childbirth in 1983, Anne looked after Jean’s two children for several years until their father remarried.  When the miners’ strike began in March 1984, she decided to try to make sure no family in Durham’s former scattered mining communities was left without support. That May, Anne organised a meeting at Durham Miners’ Hall, Redhills, to bring together activists, launching the county-wide Miners’ Support Group. A powerhouse of an organiser and natural leader, she made an effective coordinator. Anne drew people together and engendered feelings of solidarity. One of her many projects was a “toy and turkey” appeal, which provided the families of striking miners with food and a present that difficult Christmas. The support group became a well-oiled machine, raising and fairly distributing enormous amounts of money. Following the strike Anne continued her activism locally and nationally, forming links with campaigners from a range of causes, including at the women’s peace camp at Greenham Common, which she visited frequently.  She remained in her job until made redundant in 1987. Following this, her health deteriorated but she acted as an informal welfare rights worker in her community.  She took a degree in sociology at Durham University, graduating in 1990. She was part of a local heritage group and visited schools encouraging children to understand the local mining heritage. She was also a member of the women and mining research group at Northumbria University, and wrote poetry. In 2007 she organised an exhibition in the village of Langley Park called Mining Memories, involving the local community and schools. She is survived by her nephew, David, and niece, Helen.\\n',\n",

       "  'full_article': '   Skyward Inn by Aliya Whiteley (Solaris, £14.99) combines an intriguing, character-driven plot with great splashes of science fictional weirdness. The novel grips from the start, exploring with deceptive simplicity issues ranging from the difficulties of communicating with the people we love to colonisation on a planetary scale. It opens in a traditional English village pub, run by Jem, who has returned home from a 10-year posting to the planet Qita with a Qitan called Isley. Although there is a spaceport nearby, the villagers have nothing to do with it; they belong to the Western Protectorate, a region of Britain that chose to divorce itself from the complications of the modern world and adopt a simpler way of life. But even they cannot escape the consequences of humanity’s contact with aliens who only appear to be human, as the truth about the Qitan lifecycle, and the imported psychedelic brew served by Jem from under the bar, is gradually revealed. I was reminded of the authors who first got me hooked on science fiction with their combination of deep humanity, brilliant storytelling and wild imagination: writers such as Theodore Sturgeon, Kate Wilhelm and Ursula Le Guin. Skyward Inn feels like an instant classic of the genre.    Birds of Paradise  Photograph: PR   Adam, the biblical first man, “created before death” and therefore immortal, is the hero of Birds of Paradise by Oliver K Langmead (Titan, £8.99). By the 21st century, he has little affection for his many descendants, preferring to spend his time with other immortals: the original creatures he had the privilege of naming. Crow, Magpie, Raven, Owl, Butterfly and Pig generally hang out with him in human form, but occasionally find it useful to revert to type. He thinks about Eve, but not until the end of the book does he remember why she is no longer beside him. There is a plot about the search for immortal plants, and competing attempts to recreate the original Garden in present-day Britain, and it is all very vividly written – but I couldn’t help feeling it would make more sense as a graphic novel: fantastic and colourful, but lacking depth. I could also have done without Adam’s shooting spree: the old western trope of the good man driven to pick up his guns should have been put to rest long before now.    The Echo Wife Photograph: PR   Sarah Gailey has been nominated for Hugo and Nebula awards; their domestic thriller The Echo Wife (Hodder, £17.99) begins as scientific superstar Evelyn discovers that her husband has been cheating on her … with her own clone. Evelyn has come up with a way to grow adult clones from a DNA sample, capable of speech and understanding, the original’s personality imprinted on their brains. Legally they are not people, merely disposable tools. The horror of a society that would allow this is never touched upon, nor are there any moral or economic arguments made for their use. The plot is even more full of holes: Evelyn is a genius, yet her husband (a mere academic) not only runs with her idea, he manages to secretly produce her clone in his spare time. Gailey’s main concern is showing how people are shaped by others, so Evelyn often recalls her cold, brutal father, and hates her clone for being the softer, gentler version her husband wanted, but the novel doesn’t rise above the banal.    Sylvain Neuvel’s A History of What Comes Next (Michael Joseph, £14.99) is alt-history with a difference. It basically traces the true story of the development of rocket science, namechecking the real people involved in the days before the space race, but adds an alien-conspiracy-theory edge in the shape of a fictional team of mother-daughter clones, reborn through the ages with three imperatives: “Preserve the knowledge; survive at all costs; take them to the stars”. Along with the usual problems faced by women trying to change the world (or at least get men to listen to them), they are threatened by a mysterious “Tracker” who has spent centuries trying to kill them. All good fun, and since this book takes us only up to 1961, we can expect more to come.    A Desolation Called Peace Photograph: PR   Arkady Martine’s debut, A Memory Called Empire, won the Hugo award for best novel last year; A Desolation Called Peace (Tor, £16.99) is the sequel – and obviously not the best place to start. I had no idea what the hugely significant events were that had taken place in the Teixcalaan Empire three months earlier, causing all the characters to be sad, or traumatised, or simply reflective, so it took quite a while for the story to take off. At the same time, new readers will be plunged, unprepared, into the strangeness of a space-faring empire somehow grown out of the ancient Aztec culture – a fascinating creation that soon had me hooked. This is first-class space opera, with added spycraft, diplomatic intrigue and scary aliens, along with interesting explorations of perception, ways of communicating, and what makes a person. • This article was amended on 13 March 2021 to reflect that Sarah Gailey uses they/them pronouns.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': \"Liverpool's slump: a story of burnt-out brilliance and the need to go again | Barney Ronay\",\n",
       "  'full_article': 'The story of Liverpool FC’s wild, thrillingly committed Premier League collapse has been told mainly in numbers so far. And to good effect. Deprived of crowds, staging or a wider emotional palette, that basic outline – 38 points down on last year; 68 home games unbeaten versus six defeats in six – has captured the starkness of a complete sporting immolation. This is a train that has simply stopped. Better to burn out than fade away, and it has to be said no one has ever won and then lost the Premier League title quite like this. It is easy to forget that 14 games and nine wins into the current season Liverpool were five points clear at the top of the table.   Related: Fabinho back in his rightful midfield role and all is well for Liverpool | Jonathan Liew   After which, the meltdown. The next 14 have brought three wins and eight losses. Thirty-six goals in the first 14 games has shrunk to just 11 in the second. Jordan Henderson hadn’t lost in the league at Anfield since January 2017. In February he played in three defeats in three weeks. What kind of team does this? And more to the point, why? Over time the wider details of exactly what happened here will emerge. Our 12-volume Warren report awaits. What we have so far are ground-zero stills, our own live rolling Zapruder footage. One thing does stand out. A brilliant team built out of Jürgen Klopp’s own restless energy have come to resemble a band of hollow men limping from stage to stage, but the manager has been more or less silent on the causes. Instead he has looked uneasy, an ancient mariner stalking the fringes – a little haunted and hollow-eyed, but passing for now on the discharge of blame. This is significant in its own right. Klopp analyses, and overanalyses. He will have his own very clear version of events. But right now he just isn’t telling.    Jürgen Klopp is not inclined to cast blame on others in order to preserve his own reputation. Photograph: Phil Noble/Reuters   With good reason, too. Not just because Klopp is a fundamentally decent man, not naturally inclined to burn it all down in the hope of preserving his own reputation. But this is also a story that points into some difficult areas. It has been tempting to look for intangible causes, some kind of dark magic at play. In dank corners of the internet it has been suggested that ending that 30-year wait for a title has brought its own ill wind, strange humours, some kind of avenging emotional payback. In reality this has been a matter of structure and planning, of cause and effect. This was always a project built on the finest margins, a pared-back punkish setup, a team built to play in a way that would eventually stretch them to the edge of their own capacities. Not to mention a team built to feed on the synergy with their home crowd, and to chase the grail of another league title. What happens when both those things are wiped away at a stroke? This is why Klopp gets a pass here. What this season’s collapse tells us is that this model has built-in limits and brutally fine margins for error. In many ways it casts an even more favourable light on Klopp’s achievement in building that team in the first place.   An unspoken truth about Klopp’s title-winning Liverpool is that they don’t contain many obviously great individuals   To get the clearest view it is worth going back to where this began. Klopp’s team found their definitive shape in the spring of 2018, not long after the departure of Philippe Coutinho and the arrival of Virgil van Dijk. That February Liverpool went to Porto and won 5-0, a giddy, gleeful kind of game where suddenly the front three, the full-backs, the midfield axis were all in place and it all looked thrillingly slick, a team fizzing with possibilities. A month later Mohamed Salah scored four in the 5-0 defeat of Watford. A month after that Liverpool went 3-0 up in half an hour against Manchester City, the acme of that attacking blitz style. From there a 97-point league season in 2018-19, with the Champions League won, bled straight into the title-winning year. A peak arrived with the World Club Cup victory and the breathless return, crown slung over one shoulder, to thrash Leicester City 4-0 on Boxing Day 2019. This was a team playing with a kind of light around them.    Liverpool at their peak: James Milner is congratulated after scoring at Leicester in the swaggering 4-0 win at Leicester on Boxing Day 2019. Photograph: PA Wire/PA   The real stutters and stumbles arrived just after Christmas this season. Injuries were the catalyst. The real issue is the lack of cover, those fine margins again. Liverpool began the season with three battle-hardened centre-backs, two of them prone to injury. Most teams at their level have four, or in Manchester City’s case six. Even Arsenal have five. What happens when your own three are suddenly unavailable? This is where Klopp blinked, where he will draw criticism for dismantling his champion midfield to fix his defence. What could he have done differently? Klopp saw the future in the draws against West Brom and Newcastle, in the FA Cup defeat by Manchester United when Rhys Williams, a non-league footballer the year before, was traumatised by Marcus Rashford. He was right to be spooked. The truth was out. Liverpool’s replacements are a very obvious step down. These are not players ready to chase the best in Europe. No planning, no succession had been laid down. Eight out of 10 starting outfield players in the 2018 Champions League final are still in Liverpool’s best team now. With Henderson and Fabinho jiggled into the centre-back roles, with Diogo Jota injured – a rare high-grade reinforcement – there was nowhere to go, no room to wriggle. The bizarro world arrived at the start of February with the current run of six defeats in seven league games. Klopp may be keeping his counsel, bruised by events beyond football, a little sad and tender on his touchline, with the sense that someone has shaved Aslan’s mane. But the peaks of the last two years are not diminished by this. The opposite, in fact. An unspoken truth about Klopp’s title-winning Liverpool is that they don’t contain many obviously great individuals. Only three players in the squad – Van Dijk, Salah and Alisson – possess the kind of galáctico chops that might make them standalone stars at one of Europe’s mega-clubs. This is instead a feat of high-end coaching, shared commitment and a system perfectly geared to these parts. Very good footballers have been encouraged to reach out into the far limits of their talent. But the system also requires rest and reinforcement to sustain its levels. Neither of these came. Last season Van Dijk, Roberto Firmino and Trent Alexander-Arnold played in every league game. Georginio Wijnaldum played 37, Andrew Robertson 36, Sadio Mané 35, Salah 34. The entire first XI played at least 10 midweek games. The same happened the year before – and this in a team where the tempo is always superheated. Opponents found being on a pitch with those red shirts a horribly draining experience. Liverpool had to be Liverpool every week.    Despair for Naby Keïta and teammates as Liverpool lose to Fulham. A relatively callow squad have struggled this season. Photograph: Matt West/BPI/Shutterstock   Signings have been made in moments of need. But the fact remains Liverpool have spent £12m net in the past two seasons. Net spend on transfer fees – not wages and bonuses – in the last four years is £60m. This is excellent business. But it isn’t a recipe for resilience. In the long term you need more space to fail. Pep Guardiola has regeared his team brilliantly. He also has the resources to do this, because City spend around £100m net on new players every year, with the freedom to buy the ones you want, not just the ones you need because the red light that says panic is flashing.   The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.  And so we have this, a fine-margins project that reached a rare pitch because of the brilliance of the system, the first XI, the shared energy from the stands. But which has, in the past 14 league games, found its own edges. This can hardly come as shock to Liverpool’s owners, or indeed to Klopp. The refusal to gorge in the good times, to splurge on Timo Werner, is not neglect or poor husbandry. This is hard-nosed financial management. Assets will be sweated. Past performance is not a guarantee of future results. There will be no waste, no sop to chasing glory. If the team burn themselves out while creating one glorious, low-cost brand-burnishing mini-era, well, so be it. Plus, of course, that first XI is still on site. There was a glimpse of that power with Fabinho returned to midfield against RB Leipzig in midweek. The pieces could quite easily fall into their slots once again, the tempo resurrect itself, the habit of winning replace the habit of losing. But there can be no illusions now over what Klopp achieved with that high-functioning, high-wire group of fellow travellers; or what will be required to build it again.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'HuffPost UK staff face redundancy as national news operation closes down',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'BuzzFeed has told the UK staff of its recently acquired HuffPost website that it is shutting down its national news operation, leaving more than half its editorial staff at risk of redundancy and confirming the end of a digital journalism era. After the BuzzFeed chief executive, Jonah Peretti, told staff that 47 HuffPost employees were being made redundant immediately in the US, 16 of 29 full-time journalists at its London-based office received emails this week informing them that they also face losing their jobs. Of the existing news staff, only the site’s separate politics team will be retained, while the video desk is also to be cut. It is understood that the editor-in-chief, Jess Brammar, is among those at risk. Every mother on the UK editorial staff has been told they face losing their job, including one person on maternity leave. Four jobs are available to the 16, 11 of whom are women. One member of staff said: “I don’t think they have deliberately targeted women and mothers – but it is striking that their decisions have played out this way and they don’t seem to have even noticed.” Joeli Brearley, the founder of Pregnant Then Screwed, a charity that campaigns to stop discrimination against pregnant women and mothers in the workplace, said HuffPost would be “losing valuable life experience, and this will have an impact on content”.  BuzzFeed would not confirm numbers, saying it was constrained by the conditions of a consultation period, but acknowledged HuffPost would be going forward “with a smaller team, while exploring new commercial partnerships in the market”. Some staff have been angered by the way the move has been handled, with complaints that communication – via an email from a California-based HR representative which came during a staff meeting about what Peretti’s announcement would mean in the UK – had been “thoughtless at best, callous at worst”. Another staffer said: “We have had to add all [the numbers at risk] up ourselves because they haven’t told anyone anything. The people staying have no idea when their editor is leaving or who they now report to.” The password for the international meeting hosted by Peretti setting out the wider cost-cutting moves was “spr!ngisH3r3”, or “spring is here”. BuzzFeed subsequently said the company regretted the password’s tone. BuzzFeed’s acquisition of HuffPost last year came after Peretti announced drastic cuts to BuzzFeed’s own highly respected US news division in 2019. It closed its UK and Australia news operations a year later, effectively signalling the end of its challenge to the traditional news media in both countries. The two brands had been at the forefront of the group of digital native startups competing with legacy news outlets and had once seemed likely to become permanent players. Those precedents led many at HuffPost UK to fear the worst when the deal was announced. “But I actually thought they would recognise that our news stuff is our strongest brand here,” one at-risk staffer said. “Our news coverage gets viewed most.” While HuffPost – founded as the Huffington Post by Arianna Huffington in 2005 and swiftly becoming an early phenomenon of a social media-dominated news era – had a relatively small team in the UK, it has frequently punched above its weight, with particular strengths in coverage outside of London and on issues facing minority ethnic communities. This week, it published a data-driven story revealing that Met police press releases highlight a disproportionate number of violent crimes committed by black people. Brammar was the first editor of a major news site to publicly criticise the Society of Editors’ controversial claim after the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s interview with Oprah Winfrey that there was no racism in the British media. Other notable stories include a piece revealing how racists in Leicester were capitalising on the city’s lockdown to spread misinformation about the city’s minority ethnic communities and coverage of SPAC Nation, a London church that faced allegations of fraud and physical abuse of young people. BuzzFeed said in a statement: “BuzzFeed has announced that it’s begun a restructuring of HuffPost in order to break even this year and fast-track its path to profitability. As part of these changes, we have begun a consultation process in the UK to propose focusing on local coverage of politics, entertainment and Life (HuffPost’s lifestyle vertical) with a smaller team, while exploring new commercial partnerships in the market.”\\n',\n",

       "  'title': \"Massive drop in UK trade shows extent of Boris Johnson's Brexit own goal\",\n",
       "  'full_article': 'While most UK consumers found a way to weather the third lockdown, manufacturers were not so lucky after the government’s last-minute deal with the EU plunged British ports into chaos and sent trade plummeting by 40%. Without a smooth route across the Channel, the manufacturing sector was always going to struggle. That trade dropped by the most in more than 20 years illustrates how dependent on trade the UK is and has always been. As an act of self-sabotage, Boris Johnson’s willingness to negotiate the thinnest of Brexit deals was always going to rank alongside the major economic debacles of the past century. Up and down the country, businesses report edging towards the brink of collapse as hold-ups at the border prevent their goods making it to customers in the EU.   Related: UK forced to delay checks on imports from EU by six months   Manufacturers, many of which are basically assembly points for components sourced from across the world, have struggled to keep production lines moving. The Office for National Statistics said manufacturing output contracted by 2.3% month on month in January, with output falling in nine out of 13 subsectors. Worst affected was the car industry, which has already taken a battering over the past year and been denied almost any meaningful investment for four years while the mostly foreign-owned industry waited to see what life outside the EU would be like. Agriculture and fishing fared even worse, suffering huge falls in exports. The 60% slump in food and live animal exports is a startling figure, especially when the UK is so reliant on food as a source of income. It is, after all, the largest segment of the manufacturing industry, dwarfing cars, aerospace and telecoms. The government will rely on the more buoyant services sector to show the UK is doing better than expected after a year of Covid. There was a consensus among City economists polled by Reuters that GDP growth would fall by 4.9% in January but it slid by only 2.9% after consumer spending proved more resilient than in previous lockdowns. Next week the Bank of England will probably react by upgrading its forecast for growth for 2021, citing the smaller dip in activity during January as a signal of a shallower fall in first-quarter GDP.  UK exports fell 40% in January  Ministers will also argue that the trade figures were skewed by firms stockpiling in November and December in anticipation of a much-feared no-deal Brexit. That trend no doubt accounts for some of the fall in January. However, looking out over longer time horizons, a 16.7% slump in exports in 2020 is likely to be offset by not much more than a 7% rise 2021. With many economists forecasting imports will rise at an even faster rate than exports as the economy is released from lockdown restrictions, the trade balance will deteriorate yet again. Overall, it is clear the impact of Brexit will be felt for years to come in the trade sector. Worse, trade could prove to be a drag on the economy’s overall growth, as it was so often from 2016 onwards, rather than the high-octane propellent the government said it was going to be.\\n',\n",

In the home state of Daimler, Porsche and Bosch, he has not just won the support of the metal and electronics industry, but that of conservative voters, 65% of whom have in surveys expressed their wish for the 72-year-old Catholic to retain his office. Posters plastered all over the state showcase not only Kretschmann’s trademark flat-top haircut but also a robust brass neck: his campaign slogan “Sie kennen mich” (You know me) is the same folksy quip that helped Angela Merkel win a third term in 2013. The only problem for Merkel’s party is that Kretschmann is not a member of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), but the German Greens.    Election posters for Green party candidate Winfried Kretschmann. Photograph: Michael Probst/AP   Seven months before the chancellor’s 16-year stint comes to an end with federal elections on 26 September, state votes in Baden-Württemberg and neighbouring Rhineland-Palatinate could teach the German public a surprising lesson: that they can vote for a continuation of Merkelism not just without Merkel, but also without the CDU. Since winning the leadership mandate in Germany’s top export state in 2011, Kretschmann has pursued an ambitious agenda on biodiversity while keeping local carmakers on side with the kind of pragmatic approach usually associated with the country’s famously consensual chancellor. As journalist Ulrich Schulte puts it in a new book on the ecological party, Kretschmann’s south-western Greens have managed to become what the CDU once used to be and what the national Green party dreams of becoming: “an indispensable political force that represents and shapes the state like no other”. While the latest polls in Baden-Württemberg give the Green party a 10-point lead, his Christian Democrat coalition partners could on Sunday not just face a historic defeat in their former stronghold, but also the possibility of being pushed out of office in favour of a “traffic-light coalition” between the Greens, the Social Democratic party (SPD) and the pro-business Free Democrats.

Photograph: Sebastian Gollnow/AFP/Getty Images   Such a power-sharing arrangement is already in place in Rhineland-Palatinate, once the home turf of the late reunification chancellor Helmut Kohl but governed by centre-left premier Malu Dreyer since 2013. Here too, the Christian Democrats could be left out in the cold as a result of their polling lead having disappeared in the wake of kickback allegations over mask procurement deals and a growing frustration with a sluggish vaccination rollout overseen by CDU ministers.   Related: Corruption claims threaten to damage Germany's CDU party   For leader Armin Laschet, who has led the conservative outfit for less than two months but hopes to take Merkel’s mantle in September, the two state elections could provide a sobering reality check. “The danger for Laschet is that his leadership qualities will come into question before he has fully settled in his job”, said Thorsten Faas, a political scientist at Berlin’s Free University. “After the votes on Sunday there will be strategic attempts to blame the mask affair and weak candidates”, Faas said. “But one thing is quite clear: the government’s ratings, and especially those of the CDU, only shot up because of the pandemic – and now they are going down again”. How low the hegemon of German postwar politics can fall remains the great unknown. Recent polls still show the CDU as the strongest force in the country, at roughly the same share of the vote it received in 2017. And whether the second-placed Green party under leadership duo Annalena Baerbock and Robert Habeck can simply take its place on the national stage by copying their success story in Baden-Württemberg is questionable.

Photograph: Andreas Gora/EPA   “Kretschmann provides a blueprint for stealing a march on the Christian Democratic Union among the middle-class electorate”, Schulte wrote in a recent article for taz. “But such a cautious course of modernisation is far too slow in the face of the escalating climate crisis; it would even fall short of an orientation on the Paris agreement, the minimal goal of a Green coalition government”. Kretschmann’s consensual approach has involved compromises that have made the more leftwing quarters of his party wince, such as a proposal for a scrappage scheme to incentivise the purchase of new diesel and petrol cars, designed to support automobile companies struggling during the pandemic. It has also created space for the foundation of a small new ecological party, Klimaliste Baden-Württemberg, which will compete for Green seats at Sunday’s vote. Signalling too much of Kretschmann’s flexibility in the run-up to the September vote, some Green supporters fear, could damage the party’s standing just as they limber up to play a role in the next government. They point a warning finger at Austria, where the Greens entered a power-sharing deal with chancellor Sebastian Kurz’s conservatives in 2020 but have been outmuscled in a symbolic battle over the country’s asylum policy. Instead of becoming Germany’s next indispensable political force, the Greens could also go down in history as the conservatives’ litter-bearers.\\n\",\n",

       "  'title': 'Toronto swaps Google-backed, not-so-smart city plans for people-centred vision',\n",
       "  'full_article': \"When a Google-backed company first considered 12 acres of industrial land along Toronto’s waterfront, it saw a blank slate that would let it design a hi-tech, futuristic city. Algorithms would ease congestion on heated roads. Autonomous vehicles would shuttle residents past towering wooden skyscrapers. And by closely studying millions of residents, computers could learn how to make the city more livable. Sidewalk Labs pledged to make Toronto one of the world’s first “smart” cities. But skeptics saw a darker side, which included thousands of cameras monitoring streets, storefronts and parks, and harvesting data on the smallest movements.   Related: 'Irrelevant': report pours scorn over Google's ideas for Toronto smart city   Now, Canada’s largest city is moving towards a new vision of the future, in which affordability, sustainability and environmentally friendly design are prioritized over the trappings of new and often untested technologies. In announcing its new vision this week for Quayside, Toronto has backed away from many of the previous plan’s most futuristic promises, a move experts say reflects growing skepticism over technology’s role in urban planning decisions. “Quayside will usher in a new chapter in Toronto development. It will remind people of everything they want from living in the city and demonstrate what is possible when vision, passion and design excellence are brought together,” Waterfront Toronto said in a statement. The call for new development proposals comes nearly a year after the city and Google-affiliated Sidewalk Labs parted ways – a stinging defeat for a project championed by the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, and Eric Schmidt of Google, who had promised a community built “from the internet up”. Before the partnership was called off, the project had come under sharp criticism, amid questions over privacy and fears of “surveillance capitalism”. “The initial plans were definitely scary for a lot of people … it felt like [Quayside] was going to become a technology-based gated community, where everything was monitored behaviour, personal data is collected by thousands of cameras,” said Jasmine Mohamed, a Toronto resident completing her graduate degree in urban planning. “I’m glad that’s no longer a priority for the new vision.” Instead, the new plan centres on affordability, low-carbon design and an emphasis on local and minority-owned businesses. While it retains a number of elements from the initial glossy renderings – such as wooden skyscrapers – the new plan focuses more on integrating elements of Lake Ontario into parks and recreational amenities. For a city already grappling with a housing shortage and affordability crisis, the plans need to be ambitious if Toronto hopes to achieve any degree of equity, warns Mohamed. “The pandemic has brought disparities in the city to the forefront. It’s hit low-income areas so hard. And so this it’s an opportunity for the city to be bold.”    The downtown skyline and CN Tower are seen past the eastern waterfront area in the Port Lands district of Toronto. Photograph: Chris Helgren/Reuters   In rejecting a technology-heavy approach, Waterfront Toronto appears to be returning to its original development goals. “The idea of a smart city sounds really nice. It’s new, it’s innovative and it’s world-leading. It promises to make hard problems simpler and easier and faster to solve,” said Shoshanna Saxe, a civil engineering professor at the University of Toronto. “But when you dig into the details of these pitches, they really tend not to work very well.” As an example, she pointed to the “smart” rainwater monitoring system proposed by Sidewalk Labs as a way to avoid flooding. But the idea, she says, was premised both on the notion that weather systems that caused the worst damage could be predicted – and that the city wouldn’t lose power during a severe storm.  Saxe highlighted the need for decision makers to take a far longer view of city infrastructure.   Related: Canadian cities take wooden skyscrapers to new heights   “We’re often easily distracted by the idea of something new and flashy, but then we learn it’s quite hard to deliver on those promises,” she said. “And while we’re chasing something flashy, the problems become more entrenched and it becomes harder to deal with them.” In lessening its reliance on technology, Toronto has also sent a broader message to other cities flirting with the prospects of developing their own “smart city”, said Mike Lydon, a New York-based planner “The original Quayside development was a cautionary tale to many other cities as not to over-promise the outcomes of a smart city,” he said. And with the coronavirus pandemic highlighting the need for human connections, he believes planning decisions will need to centre on residents. “To bet the farm on technology that redesigns our entire streets and relies on apps and sensors doesn’t really jive with how human beings actually use public spaces – and how they want to live in cities.”\\n\",\n",

       "  'full_article': 'Find a hobby My mum used to tell me that the best way to make friends was to find a hobby. She said it’s the easiest and simplest way to find people who will become lifelong friends – and she was right. Two weeks before lockdown in 2020, I joined a CrossFit gym with much trepidation, but it was the best thing I’ve ever done. The people who are part of the gym have lifted me up, kept me going and been there through thick and thin this past year – albeit virtually, mostly. I’ve made real friends who’ve checked in on me when I’ve been down or shared walks and giggles when we’ve been allowed. Thanks, Mum. Sarah Wolf, media officer, Frome, Somerset    Tom Spencer’s mother in 1994. Photograph: Image supplied by Tom Spencer   ‘Jealousy makes people do strange things’ Several years ago, when I was going through a work-related conflict, I received considerable moral support from my mother, as well as my wife. Despite having left school at 14, my mother had a very philosophical take on life. She enabled me to see that the source of the long-lasting dispute at work was professional envy and the phrase she used – “jealousy makes people do strange things” – has always stayed with me. Tom Spencer, teacher, Switzerland Don’t judge the future by the past My parents had an unhappy marriage and a messy divorce, so when my boyfriend asked me to marry him, I said no. When I told my mum, her only comment was: “Don’t judge the future by the past.” This made me realise that my instinctive reaction was nothing to do with this wonderful man. The next day, I told him I’d changed my mind. We’ve been ridiculously happily married for 27 years. Rebecca Hough, teacher, Italy Have a glass of water My mum has had lots of advice for her children over the years, but whenever we’re ill, stressed, tired or panicking (sometimes all of the above), she tells us to “have a glass of water”. It fixes everything – or at least gives you a minute to pause and collect yourself. Sometimes, it can feel like the least useful advice at that moment, but it works. These days, it’s become a family joke, but we’ve all found ourselves at some point telling friends or partners to “have a glass of water”. Mum knows best! Emma Richards, London    Graham McKenzie’s mother. Photograph: Image supplied by Graham McKenzie   Energy begets energy My mum started telling me this when I was a teenager – I could have slept for Britain. But it is advice that has remained true in later life, too, when three hours in front of the telly watching sport quickly turn into three or four days. Get up, walk, do some gardening, vacuum or play golf and then you feel like doing more. Graham McKenzie, publisher, West Sussex Eat breakfast When camping, my mum always taught me to make sure everyone gets a proper breakfast. She also advised me to save a little bit of money each month that you can cash in from time to time, whenever you need to. And, when I worked as a teacher, she advised me to lower my expectations of the pupils, colleagues and myself at the end of term – everyone has had enough! Sophie McElroy, programme manager, London    Kat McCulloch and her mother. Photograph: Image supplied by Kat McCulloch   Be present after school My mum suggested to me, when my boys were very small, that it’s good to be around at the end of the school day. She said that when children come out of school, they want to talk about what’s happened there and then – if you wait to get home after a day’s work then children tend to have forgotten any small niggles or concerns they had. I actually listened to her on this occasion, so my husband, my mum and my sister worked around various jobs to make sure one of us could always meet the children after school. I am truly grateful to my mum and chuffed that I listened to her sage words of advice. Kat McCulloch, senior communications officer, Winchester  ‘It’s just a big chicken’ This is my mum’s catchphrase for something that feels like a challenge, but is actually just a bigger version of something you’ve done before. It comes from her experience of tackling the Christmas turkey. It’s just a big chicken! Grace Williams, public sector manager, Hertfordshire    Ros Coffey (in the wheelbarrow) with her sister Annette and her mum. Photograph: Image supplied by Ros Coffey   Be practical My mother always had a saying for every situation; in truth we often thought she made them up to fit the scene. However, the one that sticks with me is: “An ounce of practicality is better than a pound of pity.” My mum was an intensely practical Irish woman so, because of her, I have sent a practical gift each month to friends, to cheer them up during the pandemic: hand-knitted socks for friends getting chemo, food parcels with treats for friends on furlough or those who were made redundant, chocolate for one friend who was feeling down and a craft class to distract another friend. It doesn’t need to be a grand gesture, just something that says you care, and you have thought about what they really need. Ros Coffey, executive assistant, London Don’t follow the crowd My mum advised me against learning the flute or the clarinet – “everyone plays them” – so, as a child I learned to play the oboe and, once I had grown bigger, the bassoon. The choice led to so many opportunities: I was competing against far fewer people for orchestral places and, in time, I won a place at the Royal College of Music Junior Department and then the National Youth Orchestra (where there were 13 bassoonists competing for eight places rather than 300-plus clarinettists). I travelled to many countries and developed a deep knowledge and love of music which has enriched my life immeasurably. My mum died three years ago, and I miss her wisdom. It was never just about which instrument to play; at the heart of her advice was the message “don’t do what everyone else does”. It’s the best advice anyone ever gave me. Katy Astley, fundraiser, Cambridgeshire ‘Will it matter tomorrow?’ Growing up, when I was worried about something, my mum would ask me: “Will it matter tomorrow? Will it matter next week? Next month? Next year?” It was and still is a good way to put life’s turmoil into perspective. It doesn’t prevent worrying, but it does make me realise how pointless it often is. Cabi Grosvenor, teacher, Bath    Sarah Luty’s youngest son and her mum just before her 90th birthday. Photograph: Image supplied by Sarah Luty   ‘This shall pass’ My grandmother’s advice in times of struggle or worry was always: “This shall pass.” Whether it was not getting a good school grade, a broken teenage heart, grief, teething infants or poor sleep, she would say this to us with a smile and a pat on the head. She was right, of course – most pain, fear or distress is short-lived and eventually ends. This advice avoided adding drama or causing additional angst with rumination, and her quiet wisdom recognised that there will be a time when such feelings and emotions seem distant and small.

       "  'title': 'All adults eligible for Covid vaccine by May, Biden says | First Thing',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Good morning. Joe Biden has instructed states to make all adults eligible for a coronavirus vaccine by 1 May, and touted the 4 July holiday as a time when families and friends could reunite to celebrate. Speaking at his first primetime TV address as president, Biden said the expansion of the vaccine rollout would not ensure every adult receives a vaccine by 1 May, but mean they could at least join a waiting list. He said the 4 July holiday would “not only mark our independence as a nation, but … begin to mark our independence from this virus.”     Biden’s target of 100m doses in his first 100 days in office appears to have been blown out of the water, with the president announcing the US was on track to hit it on the 60th day. However, it was not all smooth sailing. The president warned restrictions could be reimposed if the US let its guard down or “conditions change”, urging Americans that “this is not the time to let up”. It came hours after Biden signed the long-awaited $1.9tn Covid relief package into law, which includes direct payments to adults in as many as 85% of US households, an extension of unemployment benefits, and health insurance subsidies. In case you missed it, here’s our explainer on what the bill contains. New York approves ‘impeachment investigation’ into Cuomo’s alleged sexual misconduct    The New York mayor, Bill de Blasio, said Cuomo (pictured) ‘just can’t serve as governor any more’. Photograph: Seth Wenig/AP   The New York state assembly has authorised its judiciary committee to begin an “impeachment investigation” into sexual misconduct claims made against the governor, Andrew Cuomo, after a sixth woman came forward. The committee’s investigation would allow it to interview witnesses, examine evidence and subpoena documents. The state attorney general is also separately investigating the claims. The three-term governor has denied all the allegations, which have been predominantly made by former aides. The sixth woman, whose name has not been made public, claimed Cuomo groped her after calling her to the governor’s mansion, ostensibly to help him fix his cellphone. But while the list of New York politicians calling for his resignation is growing, Cuomo has said he will not stand down. Mass evacuations in Hawaii after flooding    A house is surrounded by flood waters on Tuesday in Haleiwa, Hawaii. Torrential rains have inundated parts of Hawaii for several days. Photograph: Jamm Aquino/AP   Hawaiians have been evacuated from their homes in some parts of the state after heavy rains caused flooding on multiple islands, destroying houses and bridges. The rainstorms first affected Maui, then moved northward to Oahu and Kauai, before circling around to hit the Big Island. As meteorologists put a flash flood warning in place for the entire state on Friday, experts warned that events such as these would become more frequent as the planet heats, with the climate crisis impacting rainfall patterns.  This is really an example of climate change in the present day,” Suzanne Case, the head of the department of land and natural resources, said. “We have a flood emergency because of the heavy rain bomb. And we’re seeing these more and more across the island chain – more frequent and more extreme events.”  LA police under fire for their handling of George Floyd protests    In this picture from 30 May 2020, police walk through teargas as they try to disperse protesters in Las Vegas. Photograph: John Locher/AP   Los Angeles police were poorly prepared for the Black Lives Matter protests that erupted last summer, with inadequate planning leading to mass arrests and unnecessary chaos, an independent review has found. The protests swept across the US and around the world after the killing of George Floyd by police, and the report was released as the trial begins of the officer accused of his murder. The review, led by the criminal defence attorney Gerald Chaleff, found the LAPD commanders had not established a clear line of command, leaving officers in “chaos” and unsure of who was in control. It also found officers were poorly trained in the use of non-lethal weapons and had failed to anticipate that protests could turn violent or spread beyond the city’s downtown.

As San Francisco police confirmed they were investigating the incident, the driver, Subhakar Khadka, spoke to the Guardian about his experience. Israel has bombed at least a dozen ships headed for Syria over the past two years, mainly those carrying Iranian oil, the Wall Street Journal has reported. If confirmed, the attacks suggest a new front in the conflict between Israel and Iran. Matthew McConaughey said running for governor was a “true consideration” in his home state of Texas.

The artwork garnered more money than physical works by better known artists and put Beeple among “the top three most valuable living artists”.

       "  'title': '‘Imperially nostalgic racists’ target Empireland author with hate mail',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Sathnam Sanghera’s Empireland, a journey through Britain’s imperial past, has been a bestseller since it was pubished last month, acclaimed by critics as “unflinching … moving and stimulating” (the Guardian), and “excellent” and “balanced” (the Sunday Times). And yet, from the British public the author has received handwritten hate mail, and thousands of abusive tweets from “imperially nostalgic racists”, as he succinctly replied, some of them verging, he says, on death threats.   Related: Empireland by Sathnam Sanghera and Slave Empire by Padraic X Scanlan – review   “If you’re brown and you talk about race in this country, you just get loads of shit, all the time,” says Sanghera, a journalist for the Times who is also the author of the memoir The Boy With the Topknot and the novel Marriage Material. In 2019, he presented a documentary for Channel 4 on empire, looking at the Amritsar massacre, and got “hundreds, if not thousands of messages and letters and complaints about that. So I got a small taste of it then. I knew it would be insane. But it’s escalated. It’s been vicious.” Sanghera has shared some of the messages and letters he has received on his Twitter account, describing the abuse as “proof we need to have this conversation”. The attacks, he says, are a fraction of those directed at David Olusoga, the historian and broadcaster whose last book Black and British examined the relationship between the British Isles and the people of Africa and the Caribbean.   Related: David Olusoga: ‘There’s a dark side to British history, and we saw a flash of it this summer’   “Empire has been weaponised by the right wing, ever since Black Lives Matter. Now there’s this idea that you need to be proud of imperial history to be proud of the country and vice versa. It’s become a proxy for patriotism and race,” says Sanghera. “When you talk about empire, you’re talking about race, really. You’re talking about white people conquering brown people. And so when you have brown people like David or me talking about empire, it triggers people in a really deep way. David challenges the hierarchy of empire. But he also challenges the way the imperial story has always been told, which is a 50-year-old white man on TV, often getting off a train in India; a nostalgic view. Suddenly there’s brown people taking ownership of this story and it’s really triggering for so many people.” By contrast, William Dalrymple, a historian who writes on similar topics to Sanghera and Olusoga in his books and has been scathing about Britain’s “vast ignorance of everything that is most uncomfortable about our imperial past”, says he has not received a single piece of hate mail from a British person. (However, he is trolled relentlessly by the resurgent Hindu right over what he’s written about the Mughals.)    ‘There’s a whole generation of people who are very happy to believe that the German empire was terrible, that the Belgians were awful and cut the hands of everyone, but somehow the British empire was different’ ... William Dalrymple. Photograph: Murdo Macleod/the Guardian   “Despite writing very similar stuff to Sathnam, I have never received a single letter like that. It is a direct result of his ethnicity and skin colour,” says Dalrymple, whose latest book The Anarchy tackles the “relentless” rise of the East India Company. “You can’t really draw any distinction between what Sathnam’s writing and what I’ve written. And my books have got a free pass. There is a very serious distinction to be drawn between what he’s gone through writing what he has on empire, and me as a Caucasian writing the same thing.”   Related: The Anarchy by William Dalrymple review – the East India Company and corporate excess   Sanghera says he has previously received “degrees” of racist abuse as one of the few people of colour working as a Fleet Street columnist. “Everyone gets it in journalism, right? But this experience has made me realise I probably get it more than most,” he says. This time, his publisher Viking has “endlessly” checked to see if he is coping, “and that’s made me realise that it’s not acceptable for the first time in my life”. Several of his readers and followers have also shown their support for him online, with some even offering to buy copies of Empireland for his abusers. “The abuse just proves the point he makes in the book: that we urgently need to properly examine our imperial past in order to understand this country in the present,” says Sanghera’s editor at Viking, Mary Mount, adding that she found it disturbing to see the volume of abuse. Mostly, Sanghera is “energised” by the abuse, but occasionally “dehumanising” attacks do get to him. But he is not put off. “In a way, it proves the need for this conversation. No conversation or theme I’ve ever tackled is as dysfunctional as empire. It’s like, the strength of opinion out there is in inverse proportion to the amount of knowledge,” he says. Dalrymple agrees. “There’s a whole generation of people who are very happy to believe that the German empire was terrible, that the Belgians were awful and cut the hands of everyone, but somehow the British empire was different, that it was all about tea parties and smiley maharajahs and lawns with ladies in crinoline, and not at all about exploitation like all the other empires,” he says. He believes it is “universal” that people want to believe well of their ancestors, but argues that other countries have reckoned with their pasts in a way Britain has not. “The Germans are brought up from a very early age to talk about the evils of the Third Reich and that it must never happen again,” Dalrymple says. “We’ve never had that in our education system. Here we are in the 21st century, 70 years after the main chunk of empire was lost, and we still haven’t had a reckoning.” The situation, adds Sanghera, is also being “whipped up” by politicians “playing these culture wars about empire – Robert Jenrick saying he’s going to introduce legislation to protect statues. Boris Johnson saying he’s going to protect the Churchill statue with his last breath, even though it’s not going to be torn down.” “They’re pandering to these people,” he says. “There’s very little knowledge of empire. It’s just become this inane thing where being proud of 500 years of history is equated to being proud of being British.”\\n',\n",

       "  'title': \"Sarah Everard vigil organisers challenge Met's decision to ban it\",\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Organisers of a vigil for Sarah Everard are launching an emergency legal challenge against the Metropolitan police, arguing their decision to ban the gathering planned for Saturday night is unlawful. Women organising the Reclaim These Streets vigil planned for Clapham Common in south London accused the Met of silencing thousands of women who wanted to “stand up for our right to feel safe on our streets”, after police said the gathering would be unlawful under lockdown restrictions. Police warned organisers of the vigil – which was planned to take place in south London and at least nine other places on Saturday evening – that they could be prosecuted for conspiracy to commit a crime if they continued to plan the event, the Guardian understands, and could face tens of thousands of pounds in fixed penalty notices and criminal prosecution under the Serious Crime Act 2007.     Mary Morgan, one of the organisers, said the Met had initially sought to find a solution but on Thursday said the event had to be cancelled. “Women are being silenced in every single way. They are not being allowed to express their desire to be safe,” she said. “I think that it’s really important to give women and allies space to come together in solidarity to stand up against an oppressive system. These are the arms of the patriarchy at work here.”    Sarah Everard. who went missing in south London on the night of 3 March. Photograph: Metropolitan police/AFP/Getty Images   Organisers had planned a short gathering “centred around a minute of silence to remember Sarah Everard and all the women lost to violence”, she said. Care had been taken to make sure any gathering would be safe for those attending, with masks and social distancing, she said. On Thursday night, organisers launched a crowdfunding campaign to cover their legal costs, with the £30,000 target met within an hour of its launch. Human rights lawyers from Bindmans, Blackstone and Doughty Street Chambers are seeking an emergency court hearing on Friday, arguing that the Met is wrong in its interpretation of the law. On Friday the Conservative MP Caroline Nokes asked the home secretary, Priti Patel, to step in and allow the vigil to go ahead. She said women wanted to express their sorrow and “show their determination not to be intimidated by male violence against women and their solidarity with each other”, and “should be allowed to do so in a safe and socially distanced way”.  Graphic    A day earlier, the Labour MP Harriet Harman wrote to the force in support of the gathering and said she planned to attend. “Parliament has not specifically acted to constrain the right to demonstrate, so long as social distancing is observed this vigil will be perfectly lawful,” she said. In a statement late on Thursday, the Met said it understood “the public’s strength of feeling” and remained “in discussion with the organisers about this event in light of the current Covid regulations”. Speaking on Friday morning, the universities minister, Michelle Donelan, said emotions were running high and she understood people wanted to show their respects. “[But] it’s a balance between the desire to show those respects and to mark Sarah’s life and at the same time making sure we don’t spread the virus,” she told Sky News. It came as Patel sought to reassure the public after the arrest of a serving police officer on suspicion of Everard’s murder. Writing in the Sun, Patel said while such “awful” incidents were rare, they reminded women everywhere “of the steps we all take on a daily basis, without a second thought, to keep ourselves safe”. She wrote: “The police hold positions of trust in our communities and it is deeply disturbing to imagine that someone who we would all put our faith in if in danger could allegedly be responsible for such an abhorrent crime. “However, the professionalism and conduct I have witnessed through my own engagement with the police since Sarah’s disappearance has reminded me that the vast majority of police officers serve with the utmost integrity and represent the very best of public service.” A Met statement said: “We understand the public’s strength of feeling and are aware of the statement issued by Reclaim These Streets with regard to a planned vigil for Sarah Everard in Clapham Common this weekend. We remain in discussion with the organisers about this event in light of the current Covid regulations.” \\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'The Weeknd pledges permanent Grammys boycott',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'The Weeknd, AKA Canadian pop star Abel Tesfaye, has pledged a permanent boycott of the Grammys, alleging corruption within its nomination process. “Because of the secret committees,” he told the New York Times, “I will no longer allow my label to submit my music to the Grammys.” The committees that Tesfaye mentions are selected by the Recording Academy to review the nominations by its huge voting membership. They retain executive power over who makes the official shortlists. They are also able to add artists who receive zero nominations in all but the four primary categories. Despite having the biggest song of 2020 in Blinding Lights and a double-platinum album in After Hours, Tesfaye received no nominations for this year’s Grammys. “The Grammys remain corrupt,” he tweeted when the shortlists were unveiled in November. “You owe me, my fans and the industry transparency …” Of Tesfaye’s newly announced boycott, Grammys interim president Harvey Mason Jr told the New York Times: “We’re all disappointed when anyone is upset. But I will say that we are constantly evolving. And this year, as in past years, we are going to take a hard look at how to improve our awards process, including the nomination review committees.” Mason said that the nomination review committees were established in 1989 “to eliminate the potential for a general-awareness bias that might favour artists who enjoy greater name recognition over emerging artists, independent music and late-year releases”.

Photograph: Robert Gauthier/LA Times via Getty Images   Tesfaye is among a growing number of artists who have questioned the integrity of the event after it has repeatedly appeared to snub Black artistry. The last Black artist to win album of the year was Herbie Hancock in 2008, for a tribute to Joni Mitchell. After the Weeknd received zero nominations for the 2021 awards, Drake called for the Grammys to be replaced with “something new that we can build up over time and pass on to the generations to come”. Posting on Instagram, Drake highlighted Lil Baby, Pop Smoke, Partynextdoor, Popcaan and “too many missing names to even name” as artists snubbed by the Recording Academy this year. He wrote: “I think we should stop allowing ourselves to be shocked every year by the disconnect between impactful music and these awards and just accept that what once was the highest form of recognition may no longer matter to the artists that exist now and the ones who come after.” In 2016, Frank Ocean did not submit his albums Blonde and Endless for consideration, describing the Recording Academy’s processes as dated. “That institution certainly has nostalgic importance,” he told the New York Times. “It just doesn’t seem to be representing very well for people who come from where I come from, and hold down what I hold down.” Kanye West has not attended the ceremony since 2015, after criticising the Recording Academy for not nominating his albums My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy – arguably the most acclaimed album of the 2010s – and Watch the Throne, his collaboration with Jay-Z. In 2015, after Beck beat Beyoncé’s monumentally acclaimed Lemonade for album of the year, he told E!: “The Grammys, if they want real artists to keep coming back, they need to stop playing with us. We aren’t going to play with them no more. Beck needs to respect artistry, he should have given his award to Beyoncé.”   Related: Who will – and should –\\xa0win the 2021 Grammy awards?   This week, Zayn Malik, formerly of One Direction, tweeted: “Fuck the Grammys and everyone associated. Unless you shake hands and send gifts, there’s no nomination considerations. Next year I’ll send you a basket of confectionery.” In a follow-up tweet, he clarified: “My tweet was not personal or about eligibility but was about the need for inclusion and the lack of transparency of the nomination process and the space that creates and allows favouritism, racism, and networking politics to influence the voting process.” The 2021 Grammys takes place in Los Angeles this Sunday. The ceremony will feature performances from artists including Cardi B, Billie Eilish, Brittany Howard, Haim, Megan Thee Stallion, Harry Styles and Taylor Swift.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': \"Artists may have felt useless in lockdown, but we need them more than ever | Alice O'Keeffe\",\n",
       "  'full_article': 'In a year that has been almost devoid of in-real-life cultural experiences, one evening stands out. It was just after Christmas got cancelled, shortly before lockdown 3.0. I’d bought tickets for the family to visit Glow Wild, a winter lantern trail on the Wakehurst estate in Sussex. In line with the season of disappointments, I had been fully expecting an email telling me that it would not be going ahead, but somehow – because it was an outdoor, socially distanced event – it opened as planned. On an ordinary year, this would have been one in a whole array of Christmas outings, to the panto, to grownup theatre, exhibitions, maybe a gig. But this year it was the only one, and as a result the lanterns we saw that evening glow brightly in my memory. The trail is put together every year by the local community arts group Same Sky, and involves thousands of paper lights hung from the trees, light and sound installations, and projections on to the walls of the stately home. We made our way past illuminated bumblebees and butterflies, past a lake dotted with dozens of flaming lanterns. After weeks of seeing very little but the inside of our house, it felt almost impossibly bright and colourful. When we reached a magical glade hung with giant, sparkling thistledown, my eight-year-old tugged on my hand. “Artists are so clever,” he said, his eyes like saucers. I would like to bottle that moment and send it to every artist who has spent the last year feeling completely useless. This has been such a demoralising time for the whole cultural sector, and the impact is not just financial. It has felt existential: what are the arts actually for? Are they really just a bit of trivial fun around the edges of life? When the chips are down, can we just get by without them? At a time when the whole of society is – quite rightly – aware of the contribution of health and social care staff, teachers, delivery drivers and supermarket staff, there hasn’t been a role in this crisis for those who work in the arts. (Remember that awful government advert about Fatima, the ballet dancer whose next job was in cyber?) Of course nobody has the right to earn a living making art; and of course, artists have always had to do other jobs. But there is a special kind of despondency in finding that, at a critical moment, your long-honed skills just aren’t required. In a recent article about musicians who have become delivery drivers, a common sentiment was that it wasn’t merely a financial decision, but also a deep human need to feel useful, to make a contribution. In one recent survey, a third of musicians said they were considering giving up their careers as a result of the pandemic. My friend Joe Buirski, a folk music promoter whose festival has been cancelled two years in a row, and who is currently working in construction, sums up the complex emotions involved when he tells me: “The last year has made me both question all my life choices, and also love and value what I do more than ever.” It is a sentiment many artists surely share. The author Sarah Perry has written about her response to the pandemic being “that literature was useless and I’d wasted my life in its pursuit”. I recognised that one. Having completed my second novel last year, fulfilling a dream held since childhood, I spent several months convincing myself that I should retrain as a doctor. (NB: I don’t even have a science A-level.) And yet, even as artists have been fantasising about more useful careers, haven’t we all also had an object lesson in how much we need art? We’ve had so little to elevate us beyond the boundaries of ourselves. Some friends and I got bored of moaning about the pandemic, so we started a film club to give us something else to talk about. Sometimes exhaustion and home schooling have got in the way, but when I’ve managed to watch the films, it has lifted my whole week. They have seemed to carry a new kind of emotional weight – Richard Linklater’s Before trilogy, with its carefree, sun-kissed socialising and globetrotting, nearly undid me. Now, as we begin what will hopefully be a gradual return to a more rounded kind of life, is when art and artists will come into their own. The lightness, colour and feeling of wonder my son experienced at Glow Wild – that’s what these last bleak months have been so sorely lacking. We are craving it as never before, just witness the festivals selling out as soon as they are announced. Turns out that a society stripped back to the “basics” of food and healthcare is not one in which many of us want to live. We need culture now, not only to bring us together, but to lift our hearts and our eyes after months of looking no further ahead than the next step.

       "  'title': 'What is Joe Biden doing to cope with a rise in unaccompanied child migrants?',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Joe Biden’s promise of a more “fair, safe and orderly” immigration system is facing an early test as the number of children seeking asylum at the US-Mexico border has increased this year.   Related: Surge in migrants seeking to cross Mexico border poses challenge for Biden   On Biden’s first day in office, the president began reversing the policies of Donald Trump, who sought to reduce all forms of migration. But more is needed to respond to the increase in unaccompanied children at the border – 9,457 of whom were taken into US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) custody in February, the most since May 2019. This is what we know so far: Why is there an increase in children at the border? The issues driving families and children to the border in the past decade remain: the climate crisis, violence, unemployment and poverty. Two devastating hurricanes in Honduras in November and the coronavirus pandemic have added to the desperate conditions. And each year migration increases when the weather warms up. All of this is colliding with a change in the US approach to migration. For four years, Donald Trump introduced policies that made it much more difficult to migrate to the US and essentially brought asylum to a halt last year – but people kept coming. Biden has revoked some Trump-era asylum measures and children who were being turned away two months ago are now being processed because Biden stopped a rule known as Title 42 from being applied to children. Florence Chamberlin, managing attorney for the advocacy group Kids in Need of Defense, told the Guardian last week from Mexico: “Title 42 and other policies of the previous administration have created an artificial back-up at the border of these children that has compounded the danger and trauma that they fled.” It is also believed that at least some of the unaccompanied children initially approached the border with parents or other family members and were turned away, leading some families to send their children alone to improve their chances of entering the US. The border patrol also separates many children who are with non-parents, even when those adults may be the child’s primary guardian. What happens to children after they seek asylum? For children seeking asylum on their own, the first step is to contact a border patrol official either at a legal port of entry or while trying to cross the border outside those checkpoints. Those unaccompanied children are supposed to be moved within three days out of border patrol custody to the health department’s office of refugee resettlement’s (ORR) network of shelters. From there, they are placed with a sponsor, usually a family member or friend already living in the US while their legal cases play out. Child welfare experts say it is essential children are moved to a sponsor as quickly as possible - but it is not happening very efficiently. As of Monday, nearly 1,400 children had been in border patrol custody for more than three days, according to CBS News. In a call with reporters on Wednesday, CBP officials would not provide information on how many children were in its custody and concerns are growing about the number of children detained in border patrol facilities. Troy Miller, the acting CBP commissioner, said: “We’re doing everything that is possible to move the children out of our custody as quickly as we should, in a safe and healthy manner.” Why are children still being detained? Precisely because the process of getting children to sponsors is not moving quickly enough. The Biden administration has taken steps to improve its efficiency, and other changes are rumored to be on the way, but it is also inheriting the changes Trump made to shrink shrink asylum and refugee processing. Leah Chavla, a senior policy adviser at the Women’s Refugee Commission, said: “What we saw under the last administration was, yes, there were times when there were a lot of unaccompanied children in government custody and those were really due to policies that were cruel and awful and on purpose. It wasn’t because the system couldn’t process the children.” What is Biden doing about this? ORR shelters usually have capacity for 13,600 children, but this was reduced by 40% because of the pandemic. This week, Biden opened the shelters to full capacity. The administration has also introduced several measures to streamline the sponsor process, including improving information sharing between the many agencies involved and allowing shelter operators to pay for transportation of undocumented children if their sponsors couldn’t – which previously only happened with special approval. Biden on Wednesday resurrected a program shuttered by Trump that allows children to apply for asylum from their home countries, instead of making the dangerous journey north. And it is expected that the Biden administration will act on a long-held request by advocates to send health department officials to work with the border patrol, which could expedite matching children with sponsors. Perhaps the most controversial change has been Biden’s decision to reopen the remote Carrizo Springs influx facility in Texas for children aged 13 to 17. The administration is also considering opening additional influx shelters in California and Virginia. Why is the influx shelter controversial? Influx facilities are meant to be temporary and are not subject to the same licensing as permanent shelters. The news about Carrizo Springs prompted criticism of the administration returning to “kids in cages”, from prominent figures on the left and right. But many advocates have said despite their serious concerns these shelters are preferable to the alternative available today: keeping children at a border patrol facility while sponsors are vetted. What happens next? Independent advocates are monitoring what happens at the shelters, how long children are being kept at border patrol stations and how quickly children are safely placed with sponsors. There were 8,100 children in ORR custody as of Monday. A group of senior administration officials visited the border over the weekend and briefed Biden about their findings on Wednesday. Crucially, the border is still mostly closed to asylum seekers. Unaccompanied children are being allowed in, but most single adults are not. Some families and people in the Remain in Mexico program have also been admitted since Biden took office. The US southern border coordinator, Roberta Jacobson, said on Wednesday in Spanish and English at a White House briefing: “La frontera está cerrada,” or “the border is closed.”\\n',\n",

       "  'title': \"'Kern runs on oil': as California confronts climate crisis, one county is ready to drill\",\n",
       "  'full_article': \"Kern county, which sprawls more than 8,000 square miles, connecting the Sierra Nevada slopes and the Mojave Desert to the counties on the Central Coast, is the oil capital of California. The county produces about 70% of the state’s oil and more than 90% of its natural gas – and it has plans to ramp up production. This week the county approved an ordinance that would allow thousands of new wells to be drilled over the next 15 years. The decision comes despite deep opposition from local farmers and environmental groups, and it puts the county directly at odds with a state that has branded itself as a trailblazer on climate and set ambitious goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In doing so, Kern has become a microcosm of a debate happening across America – and around the world – about how to tackle the climate crisis in communities that are built on fossil fuels. “Kern county runs on oil,” as the county chairman, Phillip Peters, concisely puts it. The debate has been going on for years, according to Ethan Elkind, a director at the Center for Law, Energy and the Environment at University of California, Berkeley, School of Law. “What you are seeing here is the main oil and gas producing county in California is going one direction and the state is trying to go a different direction,” he explains, “and it’s so far unwilling to override the county on the issue of local oil and gas production.” It’s a complicated problem. Kern is also a leader in renewable energy production, accounting for roughly 25% of California’s supply, but officials argue there is not yet enough revenue from the new industries. For Kern, a county where nearly 20% live below the poverty line, expanding oil production means expanding the budget. “This is a fiscal imbalance that has to be resolved before you start talking about a just transition,” said Lorelei Oviatt, the director of the Kern county planning and natural resources department, during Monday’s vote to approve the new ordinance. “We are looking at the difference between $1.5m a year and $80m a year. Until that is resolved, the idea of banning fossil fuel extraction does not seem realistic.” Roughly one in seven workers in Kern are employed by the industry or tied to it. A county analysis done last year found that the oil and gas industry funded the county to the tune of almost $200m a year. Roughly half of that, $103m, went to Kern county schools.

Photograph: Jae C Hong/AP   Health and environmental concerns The question over Kern county’s future came to a head on Monday at a community meeting before the county’s vote on the new drilling plans. Hundreds of people from the community and across California called in to speak. Mike Maggard, a county supervisor, called it the “longest public hearing on a single issue” he had seen in his long career. Farmers voiced concerns about how the land, water, and air would be affected, while justice advocates highlighted how increased pollution would take the harshest toll on the most vulnerable. Others shared their stories about how the oil industry had given them job opportunities that changed their lives. After a meeting that stretched across nearly 11 hours, it took the county board of supervisors minutes to vote unanimously to approve the new ordinance. The ordinance, a scaled-back version of one that originally passed in 2015 but was struck down after an environmental review, will allow for roughly 40,000 wells to be permitted through 2034. It also requires producers to take steps to soften their impact on the environment, including paying into funds to help mitigate some of the negative impacts.    The South Belridge oilfield in Kern county is the fourth-largest oil field in California and one of the most productive in the US. Photograph: David McNew/Getty Images   An environmental impact assessment conducted by the county found many problems could not be avoided, including more issues with air and water quality and increases in greenhouse gas emissions. The new projects will also put greater strain on the groundwater supply in an agricultural region that already struggles with drought, and where many lack access to clean drinking water. But there is a trove of recoverable reserves still left in the ground, according to reports from the US Energy Information Administration, including approximately 2bn barrels of oil and 1.5tn cubic feet of natural gas, and Kern county officials favor developing what is under their feet for as long as they can. The cash comes with a high cost. Each year, the American Lung Association ranks cities in the region among the worst in the US for air quality and gives the county an F rating for both ozone and particle pollution. More than 30% of kids under 17 are diagnosed with asthma in Kern, more than double the rate across the state. Dozens of peer-reviewed studies done in high oil-producing areas across the country have found that living close to a drilling site correlated with high rates of cancer and respiratory and cardiovascular disease. And close to 60% of those living within a mile of the current oil and gas wells are people of color, according to a 2014 report from the National Resources Defense Council. Juan Flores, a community organizer for the Center on Race, Poverty and the Environment, has called the decision “inexcusable and shameful”. “The board of supervisors’ vote to pass this ordinance shows they are willing to turn a blind eye to the chronic health problems, disastrous environmental impacts, and disruptions to already disadvantaged communities of color that adding tens of thousands of new wells would create,” Flores said in a statement, vowing to keep fighting.    Fields of carrots are watered in Kern county. Farmers have raised concerns about the effects of new drilling on the water and air. Photograph: Frederic J Brown/AFP/Getty Images   Mercedes Macias, a senior organizer with the Sierra Club who lives and works in Kern county, says advocates will begin pushing the state to crack down on the county. “By passing this ordinance, the board of supervisors has made clear that they are willing to turn their backs on our community in favor of propping up the oil industry – and it’s no exaggeration to say that people could die as a result,” she says, emphasizing that the environmental and health risks take a disproportionate toll on communities of color. Calls for state intervention On Wednesday, community and environmental groups filed a lawsuit against the ordinance in Kern county superior court, naming the county, the board of supervisors, the California Independent Petroleum Association and the Western States Petroleum Association and arguing that the environmental review conducted was inadequate. The groups also claim that the new ordinance will fast-track oil and gas projects and inhibit public participation and environmental assessments going into the future.  Meanwhile, advocates are staking their hopes in part on a state bill that would ban new permits for fracking and several other methods of oil recovery and set stricter standards on how close wells can be from schools and homes. If passed, the bill would also create a program for oil and gas workers who are displaced, but so far the plan is scant on details. California is facing the effects of the climate crisis on multiple fronts – from drought to coastal erosion to record-setting wildfires. Meanwhile, the state has set some of the country’s most ambitious goals to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels, including a 40% reduction in emissions from 1990 levels by 2030.   Related: 'California and Texas are warnings': blackouts show US deeply unprepared for the climate crisis   But state auditors have said that, at the current rate of reductions, California is not on track to hit its target. The governor, Gavin Newsom, has been outspoken on the issue but hesitant to intervene at the county level, or offer a clear plan for how to transition communities that are financially dependent on oil and gas. Most of the state’s focus, though, has been on reducing transportation emissions and the demand for fossil fuels, which has increased since 2013. The state’s housing crisis has pushed people to live farther from city centers, increasing commute times, and the market for quick deliveries and app-based rides has put more cars and trucks on the roads.    Gavin Newsom tours the Chevron oil field west of Bakersfield. Some are calling for the state to take a more interventionist approach to new development. Photograph: Irfan Khan/AP   Last year, in an attempt to reign in growing emissions from transportation, Newsom issued an executive order requiring all new passenger vehicles sold in the state after 2035 to be zero-emission, calling it the “most impactful step our state can take to fight climate change”. Melissa Hurtado, a state senator whose district covers parts of Kern county, agrees that more needs to be done. “Our climate change policies and goals have not been working; instead they have created inequities in our most vulnerable communities,” she says. “The truth is climate change is here and we are in desperate need of a new vision on how to tackle the challenges of today, but also the challenges of tomorrow.” Elkind, from the Center for Law, Energy and the Environment, says he would like to see the state plan for a more interventionist approach in places like Kern county. “If the state were really going to get serious about stopping oil and gas production, they would have to essentially step in and tell counties like Kern that we have to phase this out,” Elkind says, adding that, so far, there have not been big attempts to get in the oil industry’s way. “We need a managed, measured, multi-decade plan, with a clear signal that we are phasing things out,” he adds. “The state should be the ones to say we are phasing it out in California and the state should be the ones to make sure the transition is done as equitably, humanely, and economically sustainable as possible.”\\n\",\n",

       "  'full_article': 'There’s something pleasingly spooky – or spookily pleasing – about watching a show on Netflix on the increasing power of algorithms to determine our lives. After all, the streaming platform probably only served it up to us in the first place because the numbers and the data we pump in with every click of the remote – even more valuable, perhaps, than the direct debits paying those gently climbing subscription fees – told the company such a programme would be worth its while. There is time to ponder such points as you embark on the new drama series The One – mostly because you will have seen it all before. Adapted by Misfits creator Howard Overman from John Marrs’ 2017 novel of the same name, it is set in a very near future world in which computers can run your DNA through a database and predict your perfect romantic match. It is a premise seen most recently in Amazon’s six-part anthology series Soulmates, set in a near-future world in which computers run your DNA through a database to determine your, ah, soulmate, and Netflix’s Gallic import Osmosis. Before that, there was the Black Mirror episode Hang the DJ, which had exactly the same premise, not to mention innumerable novels – especially YA dystopian tales such as Ally Condie’s Matched trilogy – and short stories. To stand out, you need something new to say, or at the very least a new way to tread old ground. The One manages neither, unless you count the way its puts aside all that “What would the introduction via technology of perfect happiness and mind-blowing sex for all and the end of the two greatest drivers of human creativity, progress and despair, do to society?” stuff in favour of giving centre stage to a bog-standard murder mystery. It’s certainly a different choice, especially when you dispel much of the suspense by giving away too much information too early. Rebecca Webb (Hannah Ware, floundering with a script that cannot decide whether it wants her to be a magnificent virago or a vicious capitalist bitch) is a brilliant scientist and the ruthless CEO of the company behind the DNA-matching technology. She co-founded it with fellow brilliant scientist James (Dimitri Leonidas), but he walked away from the business – and a multi-kajillion dollar payday – for reasons unknown. Those reasons probably have something to do with the venture’s shady origins, involving the hacking of a friend’s work database, and that friend going missing a year ago. (Well, if he would go and work for a pharmaceutical company that just happened to have millions of DNA samples stored in its virtual vaults, what’s a flatmate who’s got a theory about chemical signatures to do?).   Related: Soulmates review – what if Amazon could recommend your one true love?   The friend turns up very dead. One of the detectives assigned to the case, Kate (Zoë Tapper), is bisexual, as we are told repeatedly, and has recently been matched with a Spanish woman, Sophia Subplot-Primero. They have fallen in love via Skype but Sofia is left comatose by an accident after she arrives in London to meet Kate. Cue hastily sketched questions about how much we owe someone in such circumstances. Tricky to answer, so Sofia’s wife shows up instead and presents more immediate problems. Subplot segundo is formed by non-tech-matched but happy couple Hannah (Lois Chimimba) and Mark (Eric Kofi Abrefa). He is a journalist who becomes drawn into Webb’s, uh, web, and she is being driven quietly mad by the idea that there is someone out there better suited to her beloved boyfriend. Again, explorations of what the knowledge that perfection is possible could do to you are mostly abandoned for the main, unthrilling thriller plot. It’s a stylish show that will slip down easily enough on nights – and there are plenty of them – when you don’t have the mental bandwidth for anything more demanding. Beyond that, I doubt The One is anyone’s perfect match.\\n',\n",

       "  'full_article': 'Jeremy Bamber, who has been imprisoned for more than 35 years for murdering five members of his family, has said he is “filled with hope” of being released after submitting a fresh legal challenge against his conviction. Bamber’s lawyers have compiled a dossier running to thousands of pages based on new evidence that challenges his 1986 conviction for the notorious White House Farm murders in Essex. On Wednesday the submission was made to Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC), which will now decide if the case should be referred to the court of appeal for a second time. Mark Newby, Bamber’s solicitor who specialises in miscarriages of justice and helped overturn the wrongful conviction of Victor Nealon after nearly 17 years, said: “Mr Bamber is going back to the CCRC because he got a significant amount of fresh evidence to show the conviction is unsafe. It is now for the CCRC to decide.” The challenge is based on 347,000 pages of evidence, including Essex police logs, that were originally withheld from Bamber under public interest immunity laws that no longer apply after 30 years. Bamber said he had “multiple grounds” for an appeal. He told the Guardian: “Our comprehensive submissions contain the evidence to prove that the jury at my trial were not provided with the full facts and that they were misled repeatedly. “I am filled with hope and anticipation that the new submissions to the CCRC will achieve a speedy referral to the court of appeal.” The CCRC has a duty to refer the case if it believes there is a reasonable chance the court of appeal will quash Bamber’s conviction. Bamber’s adoptive parents, Nevill and June Bamber, were shot dead inside their Essex farm in the early hours of 7 August 1985, along with their adopted daughter, Sheila Caffell, and her six-year-old twin boys. Bamber, then 24, phoned the police to say his father had called him at 3.26am, saying Caffell had “gone crazy and has the gun”. Initially, police believed Caffell, a 28-year-old model known as Bambi who had recently been diagnosed with schizophrenia, had fired the shots then turned the gun on herself. But then Bamber’s relatives found a silencer in the farm that was said to contain blood belonging to Caffell. And in September 1985, Bamber’s ex-girlfriend told police he had discussed killing his family. Days later Bamber was charged with the murders. At trial, the prosecution argued that, motivated by the prospect of inheriting the £436,000 family fortune and considerable land, he had killed all five then placed the rifle in his sister’s hands to make it look like a murder-suicide. It claimed it was impossible for Caffell to have shot herself with the silencer on because her arms were not long enough to pull the trigger and that Nevill Bamber could not have called his son at 3.26am because by then he had been shot. At the end of the trial in October 1986, the jury was sent out to reach a verdict, but returned to ask the judge for clarification on the silencer and blood evidence. The judge said it contained only Caffell’s blood, and instructed the jury that the silencer “could, on its own, lead them to believe that Bamber was guilty”. The jury convicted Bamber by a 10 to two majority. He has always maintained his innocence. But the jury was not told of a letter from the head of biology at Huntingdon Forensic Science Laboratories saying the blood on the silencer could have come from Sheila Caffell or another relative, Robert Boutflour who has since died. Last year a high court judge denied Bamber access to documents that may have suggested a second silencer was found at the scene, but Mr Justice Knowles said new evidence in the case should be considered by the CCRC. Newby said the new submission contains a “plethora of evidence” from the previously withheld documents pointing to a second silencer. It also includes phone logs to show Nevill Bamber did call his son 10 minutes before Bamber called the police. “If as a result of the fresh evidence, it is accepted that there were two calls including one call from his father and one from Jeremy, then it is an impossibility for Jeremy Bamber to have been at the scene at the relevant time to have committed the offences.” Newby said. In total Newby said there were eight grounds for appeal including new evidence that the scene had been tampered with by Essex police and that police had seen signs of life inside the house while Bamber was with officers outside. Newby was first approached by Bamber’s supporters in late 2016. He said: “We would not have spent so much time pursuing this were we not convinced there is a significant evidence to suggest a miscarriage of justice.” He added: “The evidence now supports the fact that every part of the reported case appears to be untrue, and there is now a new narrative to be told which if accepted by the commission and then in turn the court of appeal should lead to Jeremy Bamber being exonerated.” The CCRC is expected to take several months to review the dossier. It has rejected two previous appeals by Bamber’s former lawyers. “This is the most substantive submission by a mile,” Newby said. The CCRC said it could not comment on the case until it had spoken to the family of the victims.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'Talking Horses: BHA welcomes news that Elliott not involved in training',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'The British Horseracing Authority has welcomed comments by Denis Egan, the chief executive of the Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board (IHRB), which “clarified … that Denise Foster is now entirely responsible for the training of horses” at Cullentra House stables during Gordon Elliott’s six-month suspension. Elliott’s licence was suspended by the IHRB’s referrals committee six days ago after a picture emerged on social media of him posing astride a dead horse on his gallops in 2019. Foster, who previously trained a small string of horses nearby in County Meath, took over responsibility for Cullentra House on Tuesday, but without any conditions attached to her licence regarding Elliott’s role, if any, in day-to-day operations.   Related: Talking Horses: Denise Foster takes reins as Galvin leaves Elliott yard   A statement on Elliott’s Twitter account on Saturday said he would be “available to assist [Foster] as she requires”. Though swiftly deleted, it led to speculation that Elliott could remain in effective charge of the 300-horse stable before the Cheltenham Festival next week, when Cullentra House will field a large team of runners. Those concerns diminished, however, when Egan told the Racing Post that Foster “is fully responsible for everything that takes place at the yard” and that “Gordon is not supposed to be involved in training”. Despite Foster’s lack of experience with such a large string – and the fact that Elliott has a house at the yard – the IHRB anticipates that her level of involvement will be similar to that of leading trainers Henry de Bromhead and Willie Mullins, who took over the training of several horses from Cullentra House shortly after the image of Elliott emerged. This would mean that Elliott is available to answer questions about specific horses, but “in relation to the day-to-day training, [Foster] is responsible for everything that goes on up there and she’s given a commitment to that effect”. While it remains unclear if the IHRB has communicated this formally to its British counterpart, a BHA spokesperson said on Thursday: “We welcome the comments from the IHRB chief executive which have clarified the position to make clear that Denise Foster is now entirely responsible for the training of horses based at Cullentra. “As the licensing authority, it is now for the IHRB to enforce the suspension in line with the outcome of last Friday’s hearing which placed the sanction clearly on Mr Elliott. Assurances have also been provided that Gordon Elliott Racing will not be promoted at Cheltenham or other courses in Great Britain whilst in the care of Denise Foster.” The IHRB, meanwhile, also published further details on Thursday of a referrals committee hearing on Wednesday into the case of Rob James, an amateur rider who steered Elliott’s Native Milan to victory at last year’s Cheltenham Festival. A video of James briefly climbing on to a horse which had died next to a gallop emerged two days after the picture of Elliott started to circulate on social media. James, who lost his riders’ licence for four months with a further eight months suspended at Wednesday’s hearing, told the panel that he was 22 at the time of the incident in August 2016 and riding work for the trainer Colin Bowe. He had been asked to assist with the removal of the horse, Three Hail Marys, which had died of a heart attack while exercising, and that a “senior member of staff” encouraged him to jump on the horse.     Being “young and naive”, James said that he “reacted to the peer pressure and did so for a couple of seconds before patting the mare as he got off her”. This, he added, “was an attempt to show some respect having immediately realised what he had done”. James also told the panel that while it was “a stupid act”, it was “not one that he would try to defend as that would only add insult to injury but he did immediately recognise his wrongdoing”. Colin Tizzard, who enjoyed the biggest success of a hugely successful career when Native River won the Cheltenham Gold Cup in 2018, said on Thursday that he expects to hand over his licence to his son, Joe, at the end of the season. “Joe will be on the licence soon,” Tizzard said. “I don’t fancy [a joint licence for] Colin and Joe. I’m 65 [and] it won’t change anything, I’ll still argue with him every morning. He deserves to go on as you don’t want to go on too late in life. “He is doing a good job and [retirement] was always going to be 65. I’ve got other things I wouldn’t mind doing. I don’t want to wake up every morning worrying about horses all the time. He should be on [the licence] by next season. It won’t change one iota as Joe is doing more and more. He deserves to have his name at the top.” Friday’s best bets Dostal Phil (2.30) and Sexy Lot (4.45) make plenty of appeal as Sandown’s Imperial Cup meeting gets underway on Friday, as both can be marked up on their latest efforts and have obvious chances on earlier form. The best bet of the day, though, may be Going Places (2.05) on the all-weather card at Lingfield, for the in-form team of Archie Watson and Hollie Doyle. Trainer and jockey have teamed up for five wins from nine so far in March, and Going Places ran well to finish third last time despite racing freely throughout. He is lightly-raced for a five-year-old and a mark of 89 could prove to be lenient if Doyle can get him to settle a little better. Cobra Commander (4.05) and Star Ascending (7.15) make most appeal at Leicester and Wolverhampton respectively.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'Covid UK: Coronavirus cases, deaths and vaccinations today',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Coronavirus has hit the UK hard, with the country recording more than 3m cases and 125,000 deaths linked to the disease. The government figures below include confirmed cases only – some people who have the disease are not tested.     Where are the UK’s current coronavirus hotspots? At the start of the pandemic, London bore the brunt of coronavirus’s impact. After that, the centre of the virus shifted northwards and to areas in Northern Ireland before rising again in London and the south-east.     Everyday life in the UK has been subject to varying degrees of restriction since March, and various national lockdowns currently apply in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. These regulations are set by the legislative body in each nation so there are local differences. Details of the English lockdown are listed here, Scottish lockdown here, Welsh here and Northern Irish here. How is the disease progressing in the UK? Cases in the UK first peaked in early April, before falling in late spring and summer. But they then increased again and passed the earlier peak in September, reaching record levels in January.     The number of people in hospital with coronavirus rose sharply after records started at the end of March, peaking in April. That figure has now been rising since September and reached a new record in January.     Deaths surpassed their first-wave peak in January, with daily deaths once again standing at over 1,000.     Since UK regulators approved the Pfizer vaccine in December, the UK’s vaccine rollout has picked up pace. Hundreds of thousands of people are now being vaccinated every day.     Is the UK rolling out the vaccine fast enough? The government plans to offer 32 million people (nearly half the population) a first dose of the vaccine by the middle of April. This means vaccinating all nine priority groups, including everyone over 50 years old, all clinically vulnerable people and frontline health and social care workers. This is after the government successfully reached their target of offering the first vaccine dose to everyone in the top four priority groups by mid-February.     How are case rates changing? Lockdown has brought down case rates for everyone. But different age groups have been affected differently. Throughout the pandemic working-age people aged between 20 and 60 years old have had the highest levels of infection. Meanwhile the over-60s have have had an overall lower case rate, largely because they are more able to self-isolate. Under-20s have also had a relatively low case rate. Scientists suggest that coronavirus is less transmissible for children, although the impact of reopening schools in England on 8 March remains to be seen.     Find coronavirus cases near you In the table below, you can find out the number of cases per 100,000 in your area, both for the last week and since the start of the pandemic.     About this data This data comes comes from Public Health England, working with devolved authorities in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. Differences in data collection and publishing schedules may lead to temporary inconsistencies. 3 and 4 October cases totals include cases from previous days published late owing to a technical fault. The government figures for deaths that are used in this tracker incorporate any deaths that have occurred within 28 days of a positive test. This means that they they are able to quickly capture those deaths occurring in hospitals and care homes, both settings where testing is widespread. The ONS, along with its counterparts in Scotland and Northern Ireland, captures deaths data differently. They count all deaths where Covid is on the death certificate. About 90% of these deaths are directly due to Covid while it is a contributory factor in the remaining deaths.  Due to the unprecedented and ongoing nature of the coronavirus outbreak, this article is being regularly updated to ensure that it reflects the current situation as well as possible.

       "  'title': 'Far-right supporters move to open source to evade censorship',\n",
       "  'full_article': \"On 8 December last year, a Frenchman called Laurent Bachelier gave away a total of 28.5 bitcoins – worth $556,000 – to 22 people. On the same day, he killed himself. In suicide notes written in French and English, he explained that the burden of illness (he suffered from a neurological pain disorder) and his loss of hope for the future had led him to despair. After railing against the decline of western civilization and attacks on free speech, he wrote that he had decided to “leave his modest wealth to certain causes and people”. Allusions to the “14 words” slogan used by white supremacists offered a clue as to the causes he favored. The beneficiaries of Bachelier’s largesse were all either prominent far-right agitators, or platforms offering them a home. The donations immediately attracted the attention of cybersecurity researchers, extremism watchers and law enforcement officers. Bachelier gave the video platform BitChute two bitcoins (in January, the price of a single bitcoin ranged between $30,000 and $40,000). The neo-Nazi website the Daily Stormer got one, the French Holocaust denier Vincent Reynouard got 1.5, and the US white nationalist celebrity Nick Fuentes, an attendee of the riots in Charlottesville and the rally that preceded the storming of the Capitol in Washington, received 13.5 – worth over $450,000. A Guardian investigation can now reveal that one of the lesser-known beneficiaries is a YouTube influencer of sorts – one with a history of promoting far-right political ideology. Luke Smith, now a Florida resident, maintains a monetized YouTube channel with 109,000 subscribers. He received at least one bitcoin from Bachelier, valued at the time of writing at just over $30,000. It’s possible that Bachelier saw in Luke Smith a like mind and a shared purpose. Beyond their common ground in far-right politics, each saw technology as a weapon in their war against liberal, tolerant societies. Like Bachelier, Smith eschews so-called proprietary software – like MacOS or Microsoft Word – and communications tools like Facebook or Twitter, built and controlled by Silicon Valley firms. Instead, Smith is an advocate for so-called “open source software” – the kind that makes it possible to use, copy, redistribute and modify software legally. And recently, he has been promoting communications platforms that might help extremists to operate beyond the reach of censorship – and even the law. What Smith preaches: a war against the modern world The man being funded by Bachelier’s donation likes to present himself as a latter-day Ted Kaczynski – the so-called Unabomber, whose infamous manifesto Smith has at times earnestly recommended to his followers. Kaczynski, a terrorist still imprisoned for a 17-year bombing campaign that killed three and injured 23, was motivated by a hatred of the modern technological world. In recent years, his apocalyptic account of an industrial civilization on the brink of collapse has resonated with rightwing extremists – including the Christchurch mosque murderer, Brenton Tarrant – who describe themselves as “eco-fascists”. In 2019, Smith said in a video he wanted to live in a “Unabomber cabin” to escape the surveillance and censorship which he believes is especially aimed at the far right. In a post on his blog in the same year – since deleted – he described the modern world as one “where your every action is watched, if you use proprietary software and communicate only via social media services”.   The fantasy of the US splintering along ethnic lines has long been entertained by white nationalists   Public records show that Smith moved to a rural property that year near Mayo, in northern Florida, whose title is held by a family member. Since then, most of his videos have been recorded in and around the property. In various videos and podcasts, Smith rehearses other ideas associated with the far right. He advocates breaking the US up – potentially into racial enclaves “maybe [by] dividing by states, maybe [by] dividing by ethnic groups”. The fantasy of the US splintering along ethnic lines has long been entertained by white nationalists, who have taken to calling themselves the “Balk Right”. This is not the only place where Smith touches on ideas associated with white nationalism. In a 2018 podcast, he offers an account of human history that relies on arguments made in The 10,000 Year Explosion, described by the Southern Poverty Law Center as a white nationalist book. Smith also directed readers to websites like radishmag, where readers are asked to “reconsider” slavery and lynching is painted in a positive light. Luke Smith did not respond to repeated requests for comment. Taken together, these beliefs come back to another far-right splinter ideology: the neoreactionary movement, which in the last decade has been enjoying an online renaissance of sorts, especially among some of Silicon Valley’s tech elite. The birth of the neoreactionary movement The neoreactionary movement traces its history to 2007, when the Silicon Valley entrepreneur Curtis Yarvin started a popular blog under the pseudonym Mencius Moldbug. He used it to attack liberalism, democracy and equality, discussed racial hierarchy in the euphemistic terms of “human biodiversity”, and counseled followers to simply detach themselves from the society ruled by the institutions of liberalism. Journalist Corey Pein wrote an account of the culture of Silicon Valley which, in part, examines the influence that Yarvin’s ideas had in the tech world. Pein says that while neoreactionary ideology is somewhat incoherent, what is consistent is the members’ commitment to extricate themselves from liberal democracy. This “exit” doctrine was influential among some Silicon Valley leaders, including the tech billionaire Peter Thiel, who once memorably said: “I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible.” Smith follows the same ideological path. His principal outlet for these ideas is his YouTube channel, where he offers tutorials on how to use austere open source software applications, encouraging viewers to detach themselves from Silicon Valley’s products. The channel is both relatively successful and lucrative, and followers rate him highly. His videos have had more than 18.7m views, meaning he could earn anywhere up to $31,100 a year from his channel on current numbers.   Smith has been pushing users in the direction of decentralized social media platforms in the so-called 'fediverse'   YouTube confirmed that Smith’s channel remained in their partner program, meaning that he continues to earn money from the channel, but that they had removed one video, featuring racial slurs, which the Guardian had asked about. Smith has lately been pushing users in the direction of decentralized, resilient social media platforms in the so-called “fediverse”, a network of independent social media sites that communicate with one another, and allow people to interact across different sites. This could allow far-right activists to operate in ways that make them very difficult to shut down. Though many prominent programmers and advocates in both the wider open source software movement and the fediverse are motivated by progressive, anti-corporate or anti-authoritarian political ideals, now the tools they have created might be used to shelter far-right extremists from the consequences of their hate speech and organizing. Manipulating the open source movement for nefarious ends The free and open source software movement has attracted many people with progressive politics, who have used it to help provide digital tools to those with few resources, to breathe new life into hardware that might otherwise have been added to a growing mountain of e-waste, or to move public institutions from Barcelona to Brasília away from dependence on expensive software. However, experts say that it is not surprising that someone like Smith would be tolerated or even welcomed by some elements of open source culture. Megan Squire is a professor of computer science at Elon University who has published research on both the far right and open source software communities. She says that “the dominant open source culture historically has been one of extreme misogyny, unfounded meritocracy, toxicity and abuse of everyone,” and that Smith is one of those resisting efforts to change that culture. In recent years, and especially since the Gamergate movement intensified scrutiny on toxicity in tech, some responded to the blatant sexism, antisemitism and racism online with codes of conduct after realizing this behavior was actually starting to hurt them (Squires says they couldn’t recruit and retain developers). The provision of safer online spaces for marginalized groups is a large part of the motivation of many of the people who have created the underlying software. On those platforms, tools for moderation and easy ways to flag sensitive content are baked in by design. But Smith is among a small group who repeatedly rail against the introduction of such codes of conduct within open source projects.   Some open source communications platforms do away with the need for servers by implementing a 'peer-to-peer' network   In a video recorded a week after the Capitol riots, when social media bans were removing rightwingers from Donald Trump down to prevent further violence, Smith said that those who wanted to bypass censorship should use the Twitter-like platform, Pleroma. Open source software like Pleroma, Mastodon and Matrix reproduce the functions of Twitter, allowing users to send out brief messages to followers. But their implementation and structure are much more decentralized, allowing anyone to set up their own platform on their own server, after which they can join up, or “federate”, with other such communities. Some open source communications platforms go a step beyond this, and do away with the need for servers altogether by implementing a “peer-to-peer” network. PeerTube, for example, allows users to browse and watch videos in a similar way to YouTube, but instead of streaming it to users from a central server, each user watching a video acts as a relay point. The technical details are perhaps less important than the practical effect: no one has authority over these platforms: no one owns them. While governments and users can place pressure on the big social media companies to ban problematic users or communities, for better or worse, no one can stop anyone creating their own servers or peer-to-peer networks. These technologies, then, are effectively uncensorable. According to a report by Emmi Bevensee, the co-founder of research consultancy Rebellious Data and the social media monitoring tool SMAT, extremists have been advocating, and even developing them, for years.   The reason I want it as a trans anti-fascist is the same reason that a Nazi wants it; we just have opposite ends  Emmi Bevensee    “Every marginalized community knows what it’s like to be systematically deplatformed”, says Bevensee, who uses non-binary pronouns, pointing to the way in which groups such as sex workers have adopted platforms like Mastodon after finding themselves unable to advertise their services. But as Bevensee’s report shows, peer-to-peer platforms are a double-edged sword. “The reason I want it as a trans anti-fascist is the same reason that a Nazi wants it; we just have opposite ends,” they explain. “You know who really doesn’t understand it? The FBI,” Bevensee adds: “we’re talking about a technology that can’t be subpoenaed. It can’t be surveiled” and, in order to carry out remote surveillance of private chats, “you would have to back door every single device in the world”. This opens the way for extremists to propagandize and organize on platforms that are beyond the reach of legal authorities and tech giants alike. After the far right-friendly social media site Gab encountered hosting problems and app store bans, it rebuilt itself on Mastodon’s software, despite determined opposition from the platform’s creators and users. Beyond Gab’s ambiguous place in the fediverse, the Guardian found dozens of servers using peer-to-peer, open source tools, which were either exclusively or disproportionately devoted either to far-right politics, or to conspiracy theories that mainstream social media services have previously cracked down on, including coronavirus denialism, “incel” culture and neo-Nazism. With the far right under pressure from mainstream social media companies and internet hosts, this may be just the beginning. But experts say that despite their recurrent complaints about Silicon Valley’s platforms, extremists will maintain their foothold in the mainstream for as long as they can. As Squire says of Smith’s internet activity: “Why is he still on YouTube? Because that’s where the eyeballs are, that’s where the money is.” • In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is at 800-273-8255 or chat for support.

       "  'title': 'Green jobs in Cumbria could far surpass posts in coalmine, report says',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'More than 9,000 green jobs could be created in Cumbria, according to a report, far more than the 500 jobs promised by a planned coalmine in the county. The report was published the day after the communities secretary reversed his original decision that the mine did not conflict with national policy and was a local matter. Robert Jenrick cited rising controversy and new climate advice as reasons for the U-turn. The government had been criticised by its own climate advisers and leading scientists for failing to block the coalmine, which would produce fuel for steel production rather than electricity generation. Critics said the pit plan seriously undermined the UK’s leadership as it prepares to host a crucial UN climate summit in November. There will now be a public inquiry but it is unclear whether the final decision will be made before the UN summit. The report said the green jobs in Cumbria would mostly result from a quadrupling of renewable energy and energy efficiency overhauls of 90% of buildings over the next 15 years. All seven councils in Cumbria have pledged to become carbon neutral and a target to be net zero by 2037 has been set by the Zero Carbon Cumbria Partnership, which is co-chaired by the county council. Creating the jobs would require many billions of pounds in investment, but the report’s backers said the government’s commitment to a green industrial revolution and to levelling up less affluent parts of the country could support this. “We have a global responsibility to do our bit,” said Karen Mitchell, the chief executive of Cumbria Action for Sustainability, the organisation that commissioned the report. “The coalmine is just looking backwards: why invest in that instead of in new technologies that have a longer-term future?” She added: “We’re in a climate emergency and Cumbria is often at the frontline of that.” The county has been hit by the worst flooding in centuries in recent years, with scientists finding the 2015 floods were made significantly more likely by global heating. Mitchell said she understood the need for jobs in the county, some parts of which are among the poorest in England. But she said green jobs bring additional benefits such as cutting people’s heating bills, reducing air pollution and boosting healthy travel such as cycling: “There are lots of co-benefits that you don’t get when you’re sending people down a deep dark hole.” Prof Rebecca Willis from the University of Lancaster said: “The Whitehaven coalmine proposals are totally at odds with UK climate legislation. Cumbria shouldn’t be chasing dirty jobs with no future, it should be working with government to bring green investment to an area that really needs it.” Cumbria council approved the mine in October. But as the backlash grew, the council said in February it would reconsider the decision in order to take into account climate advice published in December by the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), the same advice now cited by Jenrick.   Related: ‘Absolutely ridiculous’: top scientist slams UK government over coalmine   If approved, the £165m project would be the UK’s first underground mine in 30 years and produce 2.7m tonnes of coking coal a year. The government said this coal would otherwise have to be imported, but about 85% of the coal is planned for export and there is no shortage of such coal globally. West Cumbria Mining, the company behind the plan, threatened legal action against the council last week, while opponents have also threatened court action against the government. The green jobs report, funded by a philanthropic foundation, estimated that 5,800 jobs could be created in renewable energy, mostly onshore wind and solar. Another 2,000 jobs could be in retrofitting most of the 250,000 dwellings in Cumbria, and 500 jobs could be in waste management, increasing the recycling rate to 90%. A government spokesperson said: “The UK is a world leader in the fight against climate change, and we are determined to seize the economic opportunities and build back greener from the pandemic by supporting up to 2m green jobs across the country – including Cumbria – by 2030.” The government said its £12bn plan for a green industrial revolution would unlock three times as much private sector investment and support up to 250,000 green jobs by 2030. On Thursday, the government announced a £95m investment in two new offshore wind ports to be constructed in the Humber region and Teesside, creating 6,000 jobs. It plans to end coal burning in power stations by October 2024. Some northern MPs reacted angrily to Jenrick’s U-turn, with one, Mark Jenkinson, calling it a “kick in the teeth”, but Greenpeace said it was “better late than never”. Ed Miliband, the shadow business secretary, said: “After months of pressure, ministers have finally been forced to act. The government must now block the mine and focus instead on creating low-carbon jobs in Cumbria and across the country with a proper green stimulus.”\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'Road pollution affects 94% of Britain, study finds',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Pollution from roads affects virtually every part of Britain, with 94% of land having some pollution above background levels, according to research. Roads, which occupy less than 1% of the country, “form vast, pervasive and growing networks, causing negative environmental impacts”, the scientists said. The most widespread pollutants are tiny particles, mostly from fossil fuel burning, nitrogen dioxide from diesel vehicles, and noise and light. More than 70% of the country is affected by all of these, with the only land to escape road pollution being almost entirely at high altitudes. The serious impact on human health from road pollution in urban areas is well known. But the researchers said even low levels of pollution may harm wildlife including birds, mammals and insects, although research to date is limited. The findings are likely to apply to densely populated regions around the world, the scientists said, and roadless areas are expected to become increasingly scarce due to the predicted 65% expansion of the global road network by 2050. Today, there are an estimated 64m kilometres of road on Earth, a length equivalent to travelling 1,600 times around the equator. Ben Phillips, of the University of Exeter, UK, who led the research, said: “In Great Britain, we basically live on an island completely covered by roads. We found half of land is no more than 216 metres from a road. That’s a really shocking and quite depressing statistic and it seems like that would have massive environmental consequences.”  Pollution from roads extends across most of Britain  “Pollution from roads impairs small animals by disguising the scent of flowers, fertilising habitats [with nitrogen] so they become unsuitable for specialist species, and spilling light pollution that disrupts their movements and life-cycles,” said Matt Shardlow, of the conservation group Buglife. “This research exposes that the impact of roads has become omnipresent in the UK. In particular, microplastic pollution from car tyres is an emerging issue that must be addressed.” The research, published in the journal Science of the Total Environment, concludes: “The ubiquity of road pollution should be seriously considered as a potential contributor to global and regional-scale environmental issues such as insect declines.” The researchers started with maps of roads from motorways down to local access roads. “We found that 25% of land was less than 79 metres from a road, 50% of land was less than 216 metres away and 75% of land was less than 527 metres from a road,” they said. They used available data on exhaust, metal, light, and noise pollution and how it disperses to estimate the total area affected. Background levels were deemed to be 0.1% of the level on the roads for particles and chemicals and 0.001% for light and noise, which are usually measured using exponential scales. The study did not calculate the impact of other pollutants, such as de-icing salt and herbicides used on verges, or include the contamination of ponds and streams, vehicle-wildlife collisions and the habitat fragmentation caused by roads.   Related: New map reveals shattering effect of roads on nature   Previous studies of human health indicate that impacts from air pollution occur up to 500 metres from roads, and air pollution is known to harm birds, mammals and insects. Other research has shown roads can reduce populations of mammals up to 5km away. Across Europe, 98% of land is this close to a road. The researchers said the extent of the influence of roads on the environment has been “somewhat overlooked and underestimated”. Phillips said: “We’ve got global-scale environmental pressures and people always point at agriculture, because agriculture is absolutely everywhere across the country. The point we’re making is that road pollution is another thing that’s absolutely everywhere, even though it’s low level.” Shardlow said: “While roads are contributing to insect declines and extinctions, much of the harm can be eased: lighting can be reduced, electric cars will reduce chemical pollution, wildlife bridges can be built to reconnect nature, and verges are increasingly managed to boost populations of wildflowers and pollinators.” The UK government is planning a £27bn expansion of England’s road network, but the Guardian reported in February that transport secretary, Grant Shapps, had overridden official advice to review the policy on environmental grounds. Phillips said: “The environment still isn’t prioritised enough in deciding whether or not these things go ahead.”\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'Netflix weighs up crackdown on password sharing ',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Netflix has begun testing a feature that asks viewers whether they share a household with a subscriber, in a move that could lead to crackdown on the widespread practice of sharing passwords among friends and family. Some Netflix users are reported to have received a message asking them to confirm they live with the account owner by entering a code included in a text message or email sent to the subscriber. “If you don’t live with the owner of this account, you need your own account to keep watching,” the message states. So far, viewers have been given the option to delay verification and keep watching Netflix. “This test is designed to help ensure that people using Netflix accounts are authorised to do so,” a spokesperson for Netflix said.

Photograph: Ken Woroner/AP   Netflix has previously said it was comfortable with users sharing their passwords, with Reed Hastings, the company’s co-founder and co-chief executive, saying there were “no plans” to crack down on the practice. “Password sharing is something you have to learn to live with because there’s so much legitimate password sharing, like you sharing with your spouse, with your kids,” he said, speaking in 2016. “So there’s no bright line, and we’re doing fine as is.” According to the Netflix terms of service, account details should “not be shared with individuals beyond your household”. The research firm Magid has estimated that about a third of Netflix users share their password with someone else. A study by Cordcutting.com in 2019 found there were more than 40m Netflix accounts for major streaming services being “borrowed” by non-paying users globally. The world’s largest video streaming service, which in January reported it had hit 203 million global subscribers, constantly tests new features in different markets with no guarantee they will be rolled out more widely.   Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk  However, the company is facing increasing competition from rivals on a global scale, most notably Amazon’s Prime Video and the fast-growing Disney+, which puts pressure on adding new subscribers, keeping existing customers happy with the service and overall revenue growth. In the US, Netflix’s biggest and most important market, it faces even more intense competition from a new wave of entrants including AT&T’s HBO Max, Comcast’s Peacock and ViacomCBS’s Paramount+. In the UK, a monthly subscription ranges in cost from £5.99 to £13.99, depending on the package.\\n',\n",

       "  'full_article': 'The book I am currently readingI’ve been shopping my bookshelves these past few pandemic months, trying to read some of the books I’ve owned for years but hadn’t yet read, which is what led me to my current read, Boy, Snow, Bird by Helen Oyeyemi. It’s just enchanting. Funny and lyrical with something sinister lurking. The book that changed my lifeI read Song of Solomon by Toni Morrison when I was 17 and it blew away everything I thought I knew about what literature was, what literature could do. I remember thinking that I wanted to feel like this every time I read: shaken and in awe. The book I wish I’d writtenSalvage the Bones by Jesmyn Ward. Just a perfect book. Only Ward could write it, but I can dream. The book that changed my mindBefore I read Evicted: Poverty and Profit in the American City by Matthew Desmond, I didn’t know much about the eviction crisis in the US. The book clearly, devastatingly shows how eviction itself can plunge people into poverty. I have thought of it almost daily as news of the pandemic evictions pours in. It has been said, but it still bears repeating: the failure of our government to meet this crisis will have catastrophic and far reaching effects on all aspects of our lives. The last book that made me cryMemorial Drive by Natasha Trethewey. I’ve long known Trethewey for her poetry and so was eager to read her memoir. It was so beautifully written, so piercing, so tender and full of mourning. I cried and cried. The book I couldn’t finishJames Joyce’s Ulysses. The book I give as a giftThe one I’ve given most often in recent years is Her Body & Other Parties by Carmen Maria Machado. It’s such a singular book that I know that the recipient is not likely to have read anything like it. The stories are so shape-shifting that there really is something for everyone in it and I love to hear back from people after they’ve read it about what stuck with them. Usually, they’re just gobsmacked by the whole thing. My earliest reading memoryOnce, when I was really young, my parents made me write a report on the children’s book I was reading at the time. I think it was The Rainbow Fish by Marcus Pfister, but I’m not totally sure. At any rate, I wrote something to the effect of “This book is very good. If you’d like to learn more about it, read it yourself.” I’m happy to say that was the end of the book reports but not the end of my love for reading. • Transcendent Kingdom by Yaa Gyasi (Penguin, £14.99) has been longlisted for the Women’s prize for fiction.

       "  'title': \"Scientists may have solved ancient mystery of 'first computer'\",\n",
       "  'full_article': 'From the moment it was discovered more than a century ago, scholars have puzzled over the Antikythera mechanism, a remarkable and baffling astronomical calculator that survives from the ancient world. The hand-powered, 2,000-year-old device displayed the motion of the universe, predicting the movement of the five known planets, the phases of the moon and the solar and lunar eclipses. But quite how it achieved such impressive feats has proved fiendishly hard to untangle. Now researchers at UCL believe they have solved the mystery – at least in part – and have set about reconstructing the device, gearwheels and all, to test whether their proposal works. If they can build a replica with modern machinery, they aim to do the same with techniques from antiquity. “We believe that our reconstruction fits all the evidence that scientists have gleaned from the extant remains to date,” said Adam Wojcik, a materials scientist at UCL. While other scholars have made reconstructions in the past, the fact that two-thirds of the mechanism are missing has made it hard to know for sure how it worked. The mechanism, often described as the world’s first analogue computer, was found by sponge divers in 1901 amid a haul of treasures salvaged from a merchant ship that met with disaster off the Greek island of Antikythera. The ship is believed to have foundered in a storm in the first century BC as it passed between Crete and the Peloponnese en route to Rome from Asia Minor.    The Antikythera mechanism is estimated to date back to around 80 BC. Photograph: X-Tek Group/AFP   The battered fragments of corroded brass were barely noticed at first, but decades of scholarly work have revealed the object to be a masterpiece of mechanical engineering. Originally encased in a wooden box one foot tall, the mechanism was covered in inscriptions – a built-in user’s manual – and contained more than 30 bronze gearwheels connected to dials and pointers. Turn the handle and the heavens, as known to the Greeks, swung into motion. Michael Wright, a former curator of mechanical engineering at the Science Museum in London, pieced together much of how the mechanism operated and built a working replica, but researchers have never had a complete understanding of how the device functioned. Their efforts have not been helped by the remnants surviving in 82 separate fragments, making the task of rebuilding it equivalent to solving a battered 3D puzzle that has most of its pieces missing. Writing in the journal Scientific Reports, the UCL team describe how they drew on the work of Wright and others, and used inscriptions on the mechanism and a mathematical method described by the ancient Greek philosopher Parmenides, to work out new gear arrangements that would move the planets and other bodies in the correct way. The solution allows nearly all of the mechanism’s gearwheels to fit within a space only 25mm deep. According to the team, the mechanism may have displayed the movement of the sun, moon and the planets Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn on concentric rings. Because the device assumed that the sun and planets revolved around Earth, their paths were far more difficult to reproduce with gearwheels than if the sun was placed at the centre. Another change the scientists propose is a double-ended pointer they call a “Dragon Hand” that indicates when eclipses are due to happen.    Computer model of the mechanism’s gears. Photograph: UCL   The researchers believe the work brings them closer to a true understanding of how the Antikythera device displayed the heavens, but it is not clear whether the design is correct or could have been built with ancient manufacturing techniques. The concentric rings that make up the display would need to rotate on a set of nested, hollow axles, but without a lathe to shape the metal, it is unclear how the ancient Greeks would have manufactured such components. “The concentric tubes at the core of the planetarium are where my faith in Greek tech falters, and where the model might also falter,” said Wojcik. “Lathes would be the way today, but we can’t assume they had those for metal.” Whether or not the model works, more mysteries remain. It is unclear whether the Antikythera mechanism was a toy, a teaching tool or had some other purpose. And if the ancient Greeks were capable of such mechanical devices, what else did they do with the knowledge? “Although metal is precious, and so would have been recycled, it is odd that nothing remotely similar has been found or dug up,” Wojcik said. “If they had the tech to make the Antikythera mechanism, why did they not extend this tech to devising other machines, such as clocks?”\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'Out of Africa: how Netflix’s ambitions could change the continent’s cinema',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'It was the sight of donkeys carrying camera equipment that reminded Lemohang Jeremiah Mosese he was shooting in Lesotho. The director was filming This Is Not a Burial, It Is a Resurrection in a remote part of his tiny home nation, which has no cinemas and – unsurprisingly – zero film infrastructure. “It’s a bit daring to take a crew there and shoot because there’s no electricity,” Mosese says from his home in Berlin. “Especially when we go to the mountains – we had to rely on the donkeys because at some point we just couldn’t carry the equipment.” The shoot ran on petrol-powered generators. Villagers pitched in as ad-hoc crew members. Many fingers were crossed. “We had to build everything from scratch,” he says. That approach didn’t harm the film. Critically lauded, the stylish mood piece about grief, community and egregious land development has been entered in the Oscars as the country’s 2021 candidate. In truth, Mosese’s donkey experience is an outlier in the sub-Saharan African cinema world. Most films are made in hubs in Nigeria and South Africa, which have strong domestic scenes. The film industry in Nigeria is worth $600m (£430m) annually and is the continent’s market leader, while South Africa’s brings in about $35m and has a local scene led by directors such as Neill Blomkamp and Oliver Hermanus, the director of the critically acclaimed Moffie. But it is largely known for “facilitation” or hosting international film-makers who want to shoot in the country.    This Is Not a Burial, It’s a Resurrection. Photograph: PR   That approach requires government backing, something many African film-makers can’t rely on. “There were talks about how we should be set in South Africa because they have a film infrastructure. They have funds and tax rebates – they have all these beautiful things, and we don’t have any,” says Mosese of Lesotho, which has a sluggish economy and mounting debts. Although the film was ultimately shot in Lesotho, his crew mostly crossed the border from South Africa, where many had learned their trade working on domestic television shows. But for people outside those two large bubbles, things are not as accessible. Mosese and his friends who wanted to work in film had two options, he says: work domestically on films made by NGOs (invariably about the Aids crisis, which is still ravaging the country) or travel to Europe to forge a career in the diaspora. “I was always appalled by this idea that NGOs are dictating how the film should look and what the message is,” he says. “So me and some other friends of mine, we just took a different route, which is a slow one.” There are growing options for directors on the continent. Africa’s film-making ecology can roughly be divided into three categories: domestic, fuelled by scenes such as Nollywood; arthouse, such as Mosese’s work, which has a home on the European and US festival circuit; and international, the increasing number of hits such as Kenya’s Rafiki that make waves at the global box office. As well as the aesthetic battle for Africa’s image there are also more basic concerns for film-makers such as Mosese. On the whole, the continent’s film crews are localised and separated, meaning a camera operator who plies their trade on a Nollywood set is rarely seen on a Kenyan or South African shoot. Further north in Uganda that lack of crossover led Imperial Blue’s British producer, David Cecil, to search for the crew for his drug drama from the Kampala film school at which he was teaching. Cecil says the main challenge was getting access to crew and equipment, while the upsides included less red tape and more freedom to shoot. “It’s great in terms of access to locations and getting stuff done. For example, if I want a certain type of face paint I can get it, now – there’s no kind of procedure or ‘let’s have a meeting about it’,” he says.    Imperial Blue. Photograph: Publicity image   Semulema Daniel Katenda, the Ugandan co-producer on Imperial Blue, says that although film-making in Uganda is less bureaucratic, there is a “broken chain link” in the country, with directors not able to get their film shown at cinemas. “The biggest problem we have is the link between the film-maker and the audience,” he says. “We rely on our home audience to watch our films, but the distribution between the audience and the Ugandan film-maker is nonexistent right now.” Netflix claims it wants to be one of the links in that chain. Last year, ahead of the release of Queen Sono, its African spy drama, the chief content officer, Ted Sarandos, and a team of executives travelled to Lagos to map out their plans, which included investing heavily in local talent. On a continent with 54 countries and more than 1 billion people, where internet access has leapt by almost 25% in less than 10 years, the attraction is obvious. Ben Amadasun, director of Africa originals and acquisitions at Netflix, identifies a dearth of production facilities, post houses and soundstages as major hindrances to Africa becoming a major international player, plus the cost of technical equipment. The other major hurdle is funding, which is hard to secure; even when it is found, distribution can scupper plans. “There’s not always a ready market for all those titles to be sold or to get a good return on investment,” he says. Netflix is looking to buy content in all three main categories of African film. It recently acquired Mati Diop’s Atlantics, which was the first film directed by a black woman to play in competition at Cannes. It has also started to invest in remakes of classic Nollywood films, with Amadasun saying that, as it looks to build up an African audience, Netflix will be focusing on popular fare with a proven track record.    Atlantics. Photograph: Nettflix   “I would say overall there is sometimes a slant to titles that are a bit lighter, like romance, action, comedy – programming categories that appeal generally to bigger audiences, especially when you’re in the early stage of growth in the market,” he says. Whether that will work for African producers and directors such as Katenda and Mosese is debatable and Netflix still has no office on the continent, with operations being run from its Amsterdam base. Mosese is pleased with the investment, but it’s clear he sees himself as sitting outside Netflix’s orbit. “Netflix is specifically interested in films that everybody can digest. It would be rad to have a film that’s a meditation about death or about a 70-year-old widow v God,” he says. “This will be totally impossible, but I’m very hopeful that in the future they would consider films that are not ‘typically Netflix’.” Amadasun is keen to point out that Netflix is looking beyond the big two of Nigeria and South Africa. Kenya is interesting, he says, as is Ghana and the Democratic Republic of Congo, while Mozambique and Angola are on its radar. Furthermore, while Cannes and Venice are important, in the Netflix African equation so are the Zanzibar and Durban film festivals. Existential mood pieces may not be on the shopping list right now, but as Netflix expands it wants to take chances. As difficult as conditions can be, the work of a new crop of directors including Mosese, Diop, Wauri Kahiu, Apolline Traoré and Rungano Nyoni is changing the image of the continent. Diop’s Atlantics tells the migrant story but reimagines it as an otherworldly horror; Traoré’s Moi Zaphira and Frontières are bracing female-focused stories about everyday life, while Nyoni has explored witchcraft and western biases surrounding the burqa. While the work of celebrated African film-makers such as Ousmane Sembène, Djibril Diop Mambéty and Souleymane Cissé was toasted at European festivals, few of the earlier directors had the potential to reach such a wide audience.    Samantha Mugatsia in Rafiki, directed by Wanuri Kahlu. Photograph: Courtesy Big World Cinema   Alongside that, there’s the Afrofuturist, predominantly African American vision of the continent that can be seen in the grandeur of Beyoncé’s Black Is King, and in the outlandish worlds of Black Panther’s Wakanda and Coming 2 America’s Zamunda. But some are wary of that Afrofuturist fantasy of advanced tech, opulent isolationism and problematic royal bathers. Katenda says he is cautious about people from overseas creating a standardised image of the continent based on Black Is King and Black Panther. “Then everybody’s going to try to adopt Africa’s image to this,” he says. Last year, Africa produced its first animated feature, made in Nigeria and self-funded. Micro-budget projects have taken off in South Africa, as traditional funding routes become blocked off because of the pandemic. The kind of improvisation and innovation seen on Mosese’s set is a constant on a continent that is – in many regions and areas of cinema – still developing. A new scramble for Africa’s cinema has only just begun.\\n',\n",

       "  'full_article': 'Joy unconfined in Britain this week as millions of children went back to school and millions of parents were finally relieved of the need to juggle Zoom meetings with explaining the seven times table to a restless infant with ketchup on their elbow (the child’s elbow, that is, though I suppose it could be the parent’s elbow too). Much has been made of the threat the pandemic poses to the mental health of our young people. Children have been deprived of education, friendship, exercise, socialisation and purpose – a surefire way to erode mental equilibrium, even if many will also have enjoyed missing out on a few months of grey, soggy school meals. But we also wonder if in the longer term, the opposite may also be true.

       "  'full_article': 'As a peace-keeping mission, I spent last Sunday deep-cleaning the kitchen. Sharing a cooking space with a loved one is an unending test of patience, and we should all be more upfront about it on the first date. “Hello, I’m Grace,” I would say before even taking off my coat. “I always own at least six jars of stale mint sauce and I leave a trail of cumin seeds wherever I go. Oh, and just a heads-up, I don’t put the lids back on jars properly.” Charles, meanwhile, should have been more specific, before I fell in love with him, about his frankly unhinged belief that runny things – mayo, hot sauce, marmalade – have to be kept refrigerated. This means that every cubic inch of the fridge is stuffed with ketchups, jams and mustards, with no space for any actual food. This position is both berserk and untenable. “But jam doesn’t go off!” I say 10 times a month. “It’s a preserve!” “Well, it wouldn’t go off if you screwed the lid back on properly and stopped putting a buttery knife in it so it grows mould,” he invariably replies. His expression is weary, and of having lived through so much.Real kitchens are full of these endless, everyday ructions. In fact, ignoring how annoying we all are to share space with is the bread and butter of real love and friendship. Love is turning a blind eye to squashed tea bags that don’t quite make it to the bin and instead sit forlornly on the breadboard. Or tolerating the mystery teenage sandwich maker who leaves the bread out to go stale at 3am and the kitchen lights ablaze. Love is bin bags that aren’t secured properly, veg peelings on the floor and smiling sweetly at those among us who put empty milk cartons back in the fridge and never refill the pepper grinder. Love is tolerating that person who rarely, if ever, fills the dishwasher, yet holds strong feelings on exactly how it should be stacked. “Forks go upright in the fork drawer,” they’ll tell you, over your shoulder, while somehow missing the fact that you load the machine 14 times a week without their instruction.One of the chief reasons we adore cookery shows, I believe, is that they’re not filmed in real kitchens. Well, they are, but they’re not; it’s very clever. The lights are on, but there’s no one at home. On Saturday Kitchen and Sunday Brunch, each time the cameras turn off, a small army of food technicians rush in with sprays, mops and sponges. They ferry in trays of ingredients all neatly chopped for the chefs’ next work of art, then disappear, but not before neatening and dusting the rows of spices in the racks in the background. It is not a real kitchen in which anyone leaves a pile of used underwear in a shrine in front of the washing machine, having meant to begin a wash, only to realise the machine’s still full from two days back. When Simon Rimmer makes bechamel sauce, there’s no one standing behind him with the nozzle of the squirty cream in their gob. When the guests drink wine, the glasses are never gritty because someone forgot to add salt to the dishwasher, which leads to an argument over who last unblocked the filter. In these make-believe spaces, which we all love so much, all the spats and bad feeling are removed, and all that’s left is a place where the chef can be charismatic and play with a six-burner Bosch cooktop. I, too, am guilty of this make-believe: on a recent ITV programme, I made “homemade” fudge in my million-pound, state-of-the-art kitchen on gleaming quartz worktops and surrounded by playthings such as my avant-garde sous-vide machine, double-fronted, American-style fridge and automatic hot-water tap, all with the backdrop of a perfectly kept autumn garden. But this was not my life. It’s the life of a woman called Julie in Islington who rents out her home for £800 a day. It costs extra to pay the food stylists who measure out the sugar and the person who spends hours plastering on makeup to make me look as if I do this every day. We couldn’t film it in my actual kitchen – there’s no room due to my antique mint sauce collection – but I’ve watched a version of me on television, and that Grace’s kitchen – in fact, her entire life – is perfect. She wears a bra before noon. There’s not a cumin seed anywhere. She pours sugar on to scales, and returns the jar neatly to its shelf. “Why can’t I live with that woman?” Charles asks sadly. “She replaces lids.”\\n',\n",

       "  'title': \"Locked Down review – Anne Hathaway and Chiwetel Ejiofor's pandemic stinker\",\n",
       "  'full_article': 'For the handful of films and shows that were bravely, or often stupidly, marched into production during last year’s shutdown (one that continues to severely damage the industry), two key questions needed to be answered. First, can it be done safely with all precautions taken to protect the health of cast and crew? And second, is this project really worth it, worth all of the myriad difficulties attached, both financial and logistical? For talky heist romcom Locked Down, it appears as if safety was ensured and maintained (unlike many other shoots, no word emerged of on-set infections) but vitally, the small matter of “but should we?” appears to have been crucially, and tragically, overlooked. For not only would the film have been an insufferable bore without a global pandemic raging on but given the added stresses and strains and possible danger involved in making it now, its existence feels like even more of an offence, a head-smashingly redundant waste of time, talent, energy and resources, a shockingly early yet entirely convincing contender for worst film of the year.   Related: The White Tiger review – Balzac-worthy satire of submission and power   Its straight-out-of-the-gate awfulness recalls writer, and Peaky Blinders creator, Steven Knight’s similarly disastrous January stinker Serenity which kicked off 2019 as the year’s most heinous and impressively held that position through to the bitter end. But that film, a pretentious noir thriller starring Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway and a giant tuna named Justice, had a twist so hilariously stupid that by the end it became a fun two-bottles-of-wine hate-watch. This time around, however, the only fun one might have is mercifully switching it off in the first act and doing genuinely anything else instead (staring at a blank wall in total silence would be preferable).    What makes its stench that much harder to endure is that in a different universe, with a very different script, there’s something here that could have flown, especially at this moment. On paper, and in the deceptively snappy trailer, the idea of two attractive, charismatic and adept movie stars flirting and arguing their way through a pandemic-assisted Harrods diamond heist seems like a giddy way to spend yet another night stuck in front of the TV. But even an experienced director like Doug Liman, who assembled not dissimilar ingredients with a far surer hand in the slick and entertaining Mr and Mrs Smith, can’t find enough room to breathe with Knight’s ungainly, faux-intellectual dialogue suffocating every scene. As the warring soon-to-be-criminal couple, trapped in a west London house together during the pandemic, a returning Hathaway (who really should know better) and Chiwetel Ejiofor (who deserves much better), also find it hard to sell or even understand much of the sub-latter-day Woody Allen-esque waffle they’re stuck with, sentenced to lines that are both overwritten yet underdeveloped. There are also brief Zoom cameos from Ben Stiller, Mindy Kaling, Stephen Merchant and Ben Kingsley, who can all at least explain away their low-stakes involvement as the result of sheer boredom. We’ve already seen that frantically scrambling together a film during lockdown can result in unlikely greatness, as proved last summer by Rob Savage’s ingenious, micro-budget cyber-horror Host, but when scrambled together without care or time for a much-needed second, third, fourth and fifth draft of the script, the end-product can be forgettable at best and embarrassing at worst. Locked Down is both and more, a dull assemblage of half-thought-through ideas written with such utter shoddiness, it’s a miracle HBO Max ended up buying it (its swift last-minute dump implies some serious buyer’s remorse). As a heist movie it’s willfully unexciting and fully incompetent, with a barely comprehensible and bizarrely unmotivated scheme riddled with glaring plot-holes and as a romantic comedy, it’s equally dead on arrival thanks to a pair of lovers who hardly make sense as fictional characters let alone real people. Both actors work admirably hard at putting a sheen on the material, using their considerable combined charm for some painfully heavy lifting, but as the punishingly overlong two-hour film progresses (it will be a miracle if even half of its viewers make it past the midpoint), they find it impossible to do anything other than keep their heads down in shame and race to the finale, hoping to emerge unscathed.    The film is hinged on a rather regrettable gender dynamic that suggests the pair – her, an accomplished bread-winning businesswoman and him, a sober wannabe poet called Paxton who’s lost his “wild” side after being forced into a low-level driving job because he was convicted of killing a man in a noble fight years earlier (!?!?!) – would be much happier if they returned to a more traditional “Me Tarzan, You Jane” set-up. Knight’s script possesses an equally tiresome view of the lockdown, painted as an annoyance rather than a necessary safety measure (described as “idiotic” and “insane” during one of many unbearable monologues) and the film never once seems to take any notice of the damage inflicted by the virus, just how bored it makes our central duo. Their boredom is made even more exhausting when coupled with their extreme privilege, both holed up in a luxurious multi-level house in an affluent borough as the world crashes around them. There are many, many misfiring attempts at comedy (isn’t Zoom annoying lol etc) but no joke lands with quite as much of a thud as Ejiofor’s driver being forced to use the fake name of Edgar Allen Poe while being convinced that security guards would be too uneducated to know who that is. It’s a recurring gag that’s as snobby as it is dreadfully unfunny and like much of the surrounding film it leaves a sour, unpleasant taste that lingers. Rather than just providing us with a serviceable caper, Knight ambitiously aims for profundity instead, a decision that kills his limp film at birth (“Even before the fucking virus we were all locked down in our own routines” is the level of insight we’re left with). It’s a moronic script written as if it’s actually incredibly smart, leading to the worst kind of bad movie, reaching for the stars but tripping over itself before it can even stand up. My advice for surviving 2021 is simple: wear a mask, wash your hands and please, please keep your distance from Locked Down.  Locked Down is available on HBO Max in the US on 14 January with a UK date yet to be announced \\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'Europe doubles down on cycling in post-Covid recovery plans',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'When the coronavirus pandemic led to lockdowns a year ago, hundreds of cities reconfigured their streets to make walking and cycling easier to aid social distancing and reduce air pollution. Now, with an end to the lockdowns in sight, the measures have proved so successful that cities across Europe are betting on the bicycle to lead the recovery. According to the European Cyclists’ Federation (ECF), the continent’s cities spent €1bn on Covid-related cycling measures in 2020, creating at least 600 miles (1,000km) of cycle lanes, traffic-calming measures and car-free streets. What’s more, it was not just the usual suspects in Denmark and the Netherlands taking action, but places with inadequate infrastructure. The pandemic revealed a latent demand for cycling and walking infrastructure and offered a chance to “build back better”, as politicians are fond of saying. Now many cities are busy accelerating existing plans to do just that. The ECF’s Aleksander Buczyński said: “I think to a large degree the pandemic only accelerated some processes … The cities that made good provisional cycle paths were generally positively accepted by the inhabitants, if not uniformly.” In Barcelona during the pandemic, public transport use fell by 50% and private car use by just 10%. In a city where many people own cars they previously used only at weekends, this was a congestion disaster waiting to happen.   Related: Two-way street: how Barcelona is democratising public space   An initial 13 miles of pop-up cycle lanes were installed in summer 2020 to plug holes in the cycle network and encourage people avoiding public transport to cycle, and four more miles are being added. Cycle use has now risen to 10% above pre-pandemic levels. Barcelona officials are accelerating the construction of 100 miles of new or improved cycle routes, increasing the network to 190 miles by 2024. This also prepares the ground for the Superblocks programme, of which cycle routes are an essential element and part of targets to cut car use by 25% by 2024. Milan’s Strade Aperte programme was launched in April 2020 with a proposed 22 miles of new protected cycle lanes and pedestrian priority areas. The cycle route on Corso Buenos Aires is now the busiest in town, used by as many as 10,000 cyclists a day, an increase of 122% in a few months. Milan has now expanded Strade Aperte to 42 miles and is aiming for 62 miles by this summer. In Paris, streets once dominated by cars are filled with cycles. Since spring 2020, cycling is estimated to have grown by 70%, and 31 miles of temporary coronapistes installed early in the crisis are to be made permanent, with more added. The proportion of women cycling has grown, and a recent survey found 62% of residents wanted the lanes made permanent.    A bike lane in Paris in January. Photograph: Jacques Witt/Sipa/Rex/Shutterstock   After re-election last year, the mayor, Anne Hidalgo, is accelerating cycleway plans further. According to ECF, Paris has delivered 100 miles of a planned 200 miles of new routes. Lisbon is in the process of almost doubling its 65-mile cycle network to 124 miles this year, starting with pop-up lanes to create new protected routes. In common with Barcelona, this is part of longer-term plans to increase walking and cycling, tackle air pollution and reduce the impact of heatwaves, with accompanying measures to increase street shade. Expanded 30km/h zones, pedestrianised zones, cycle parking and greenery are also part of the picture. In a year, cycling has grown by 25% and the proportion of women cycling has also increased.    A Lisbon bike lane. Photograph: Hugo Amaral/Sopa Images/Rex/Shutterstock   In a survey spanning 21 European cities, 64% of respondents said they did not want to return to pre-Covid air pollution levels, which are illegally high in many cities. Three-quarters were willing to reallocate public space from cars to active travel to achieve this, while 21% said they planned to cycle more after lockdown, and 35% planned to walk more. London has installed or started work on 62 miles of cycle routes since the start of the pandemic, and Transport for London data from January shows cycling has increased by 22% in outer London since 2019. Almost half of all journeys in London were made by cycling and walking from April to June 2020, up from 29% before the pandemic. Will Norman, London’s walking and cycling commissioner, said: “It’s vital we continue to build on this positive legacy from the pandemic rather than experiencing a car-led recovery, which would risk replacing one public health crisis with another air-quality-based one.” Brussels trialled 37 miles of pop-up cycle routes in 2020, increasing “active cyclists” by 87%, and Belgium is now looking to extend its cycle highway plans between towns and cities. The Flemish government upped the ante in March 2021 by announcing a €150m cycling package, taking its per head spend to €22 (£19) a year – for comparison, the UK spends about £7 per person.  Across Europe cycle tourism boomed, not least as travel restrictions limited further outings, and as part of its recovery Italy plans to invest in 630 miles of new urban and metropolitan cycle paths for transport and leisure, and 1,000 miles of tourist cycle paths. Krakow installed a handful of cycle paths that doubled cycling levels last summer, with many people switching from public transport to bikes. The city has now developed a five-year plan to expand the cycle network further. “People say it took the Dutch or the Danish cities 30 or 50 years to build their cycle infrastructure, but we don’t have this kind of time,” said Buczyński. “We have the climate emergency, which we cannot deal with in 50 years. We need to change the transport system pretty quickly, and it will be very difficult without making cycling a viable option for everyone. “We need to do it fast, maybe not in two months but in a few years.”\\n',\n",

       "  'title': \"Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe 'in urgent need of psychiatric support'\",\n",
       "  'full_article': ' Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe “is in urgent need of psychiatric support” and has been the victim of torture, a report prepared by psychiatrists has found after examining her mental health. The detained British-Iranian dual-national’s healing “can be only provided in the UK in the presence of her family after reunification”, the report says. The 77-page report, prepared for the campaign group Redress, comes ahead of the Iranian authorities deciding on Sunday whether Zaghari-Ratcliffe should face a second set of charges. Intensive backstage diplomacy is under way to prevent the charges being laid. Redress urged the UK foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, to accept that she has been the victim of torture. The report was prepared by two doctors after extensive virtual discussions with her in October and February.     Zaghari-Ratcliffe spent nearly four years in two different prisons and spent nine months in solitary confinement, a regular feature of Iranian interrogation techniques in cases of what they describe as security prisoners. The experts note that the psychological and physical conditions that she experienced while in prison have persisted while Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been living with her parents in Iran, “where the continuing uncertainty of her fate creates a sense of permanent threat leading to constant pain and suffering”. The examination was conducted virtually by Prof Dr Michele Heisler and Dr Lilla Hardi, two members of the internationally recognised independent experts forensic group. The report finds Zaghari-Ratcliffe is suffering from “serious post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), major depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder due to her mistreatment during detention, present house arrest, and continuing legal and judicial uncertainty. In addition, Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe experiences physical pain and impairment that developed over the course of her imprisonment, including neck, shoulder and arm pain and numbness, tooth pain, possible anaemia, and breast lumps, which have not been adequately evaluated or treated.” The report also finds she needs “individual psychotherapy that will provide her with the opportunity to develop a trusting relationship with a therapist who has a specialty in the treatment of severe trauma”. The emphasis on the torture of solitary confinement in the report comes as a group of 25 civil rights activists begin a lawsuit in Tehran claiming the practice of placing detainees in prolonged solitary confinement is routinely used in Iran to isolate and weaken detainees in order to extract false “confessions”. They claim in the lawsuit, filed at the beginning of this month, that Iranian law does not recognise solitary confinement as a means of punishment. “There is no legal authority for solitary confinement and indeed Iran’s supreme administrative court ruled in 2004 that regulations allowing suspects to be held in solitary were unlawful,” the claim says. They argue in the lawsuit that “at present, solitary confinement is routinely carried out by Iran’s security agencies – both the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps’ (IRGC) Intelligence Organization, which is under the authority of Iran’s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, and the intelligence ministry, which operates under the authority of President Hassan Rouhani”.\\n',\n",

       "  'full_article': 'If there was anything guaranteed to rile the anti-woke brigade, it ought to be the news that Superman could soon be black on the big screen, just as a woman takes on the mantle of Thor. And yet, what’s that we hear rumbling through the cosmos like space tumbleweed, but the sound of (relative) silence?   Related: Coming 2 America is an unfunny disaster for representation | Kovie Biakolo   Apart from a few minor Twitter grumbles when it was announced at Comic-Con 2019 that Natalie Portman was to take on the role of Marvel’s thunder god, there has been very little in the way of backlash – certainly nothing like the horrible behaviour dished out to Kelly Marie Tran for daring to sign up to Star Wars, or to Leslie Jones for appearing in the all-female Ghostbusters remake. Nor have the trolls really begun to target reports that acclaimed essayist and novelist Ta-Nehisi Coates will pen a new film about the man of steel for Warner Bros that is expected to feature a black version of Kal-El. That movie is being produced (and possibly directed) by JJ Abrams, though there are rumours the studio might be looking for a black director, too. With publicity beginning to ramp up for next year’s Thor: Love & Thunder, there’s still time for negativity to surface, as the trolls get their teeth into Warner Bros’s film. But right now, it seems there’s only positivity flowing around both projects.    Ta-Nehisi Coates will write the script for Warner Bros’ new Superman film. Photograph: Mary Altaffer/AP   Love & Thunder will once again be directed by Taika Waititi, who did such an excellent job with Thor: Ragnarok. And the reality is that Thor has always been more interesting on the big screen when he’s been out of sorts. The best moments in Kenneth Branagh’s underrated original 2011 movie are those in which the arrogant young Thor gets cast out of Asgard by a beardy Anthony Hopkins to learn humility and the true meaning of heroism as an Earthbound mortal. He’s also brilliant as a beer-gutted drunk in Avengers: Endgame. You can imagine the Marvel bods, while trying to dream up Thor’s next adventure, seizing upon the recent comic book run in which Jane Foster becomes Thor as the perfect way to move the character on and avoid him reverting to the tedious cosmic princeling of Thor: The Dark World. It also helps when you have an actor of the calibre of Portman available. The black Superman concept – Michael B Jordan is a hot tip to star – also boasts a what’s-not-to-like quality, especially if Warner Bros hires a director of colour. Coates boasts that rare combination of intellectual clout and geeky cool, as both the recipient of a 2015 “genius” grant from the MacArthur foundation and a writer of Black Panther and Captain America comics for Marvel. The idea of a writer who specialises in examining both the African American experience and the evil legacy of white supremacy working on a superhero whose mantra is “truth, justice and the American way” almost blows the mind. How would Kal-El’s perspective on humanity shift if he found himself viewed through a racist prism of fear and suspicion by some of the very people he came all the way across the galaxy to help? At the very least, we can be sure he would spend a lot less time trying to date Lois and saving imperilled cats. The fact that movies like these are being met with enthusiasm should not signal that the dark side of the internet is dwindling. After all, we don’t have to look too far back to find a time when blatant racism was something to be brushed under the carpet, rather than publicly called out. Only this week, Harry Potter star Katie Leung revealed that she faced online abuse after her role as Cho Chang was announced over a decade ago, even stumbling upon a “hate site” directed at her. Leung told the Chinese Chippy Girl podcast she was told by publicists to deny the attacks were happening.    Leaps and bounds … Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. Photograph: Landmark Media/Alamy Stock Photo   It would be nice to think that Leung’s appearance as Potter’s romantic interest helped boost the multicultural makeup of the world’s fifth highest-grossing film franchise of all time. But it’s also worth bearing in mind that if those movies had been made a decade later, an actor of colour might easily have been cast as one of the film’s leads. That’s a cultural shift that’s already begun in superhero movies. When dealt with intelligently and creatively, shifts in the makeup of decades-old costumed crimefighters have only proved to make them more intriguing. Without the introduction of Miles Morales we would never have born witness to the Oscar-winning, psychedelic joy that was Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. Few would argue that Samuel L Jackson makes a better Nick Fury than David Hasselhoff. Will Thor: Love & Thunder and the black Superman movie end up helping to change racist and sexist attitudes? It would be nice to think so. Will they be more intriguing than the films that might otherwise have been made? Almost certainly.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': \"Friend of Christian Porter's accuser says he has 'clear recollections' of 'relevant discussions' with Porter\",\n",
       "  'full_article': \"A longtime friend of the woman who alleged she was raped by the federal attorney general, Christian Porter, as a teenager has said he had “clear recollections of relevant discussions” with Porter from at least 1992. The revelation prompted the NSW police commissioner, Mick Fuller, to say he would re-examine the case. Porter has denied the allegation as “never happening”. Macquarie Bank managing director James Hooke released a statement on Friday afternoon as someone who had known Porter’s accuser, and Porter, for the past 30 years. Hooke said the woman, who he considered to be a “very dear friend”, and he had “relevant discussions” about the event from “mid-1988 until her death”. Hooke also recollected speaking with Porter from 1992 onwards.   Related: AFP didn't pass on documents detailing allegation against Christian Porter to NSW police   Hooke said in a written statement: “I continue to be devastated by the untimely death of my very dear friend and I am enormously concerned for the privacy and dignity of [her] family. I am also concerned for the well-being of Christian Porter. I have known all of them for approximately 30 years. We all find ourselves at a very upsetting time. “Mine is a just one set of recollections and I am aware of the fallibility of human memory, however unintentional. That said, I have what I consider to be clear recollections of relevant discussions I had with [the woman] over the years from mid-1988 until her death. “I also have what I consider to be clear recollections of relevant discussions I had with Christian Porter from April 1992 and through the mid-1990s.” Fuller told a NSW budget estimates hearing on Friday he would re-examine the case in light of Hooke’s statement. Asked by state Greens upper house MP David Shoebridge whether he would look to reopen the investigation, Fuller said he was “more than happy to look into it”. “I know it’s a matter of Australian significance,” the police commissioner said. “I’m not going to say here on the record that we’re reopening the case but I’m more than happy to talk to deputy commissioner, [David] Hudson, and then through the chain of command to ensure all the information has been properly assessed in terms of [deciding] that there’s not enough admissible evidence to go forward.” But while Fuller said he was “always open to new investigations” he cautioned that although it was not impossible to prosecute a sexual assault case without the alleged victim “in reality it just wouldn’t happen”. A spokesman for Porter declined to comment on the Hooke statement, saying: “As noted at his press conference on 3 March, the attorney general is on medical leave. He does not propose to comment further.” In his press conference, where he identified himself as the cabinet minister accused of a historical rape, Porter said he was first made aware of the claims at a dinner with a friend in November 2019. While maintaining specific allegations had not been put to him, and he did not read the letter or statement sent to Morrison by the woman’s friends, Porter said he first became aware of “rumours” last November. “There was a very old friend of mine, whom I had dinner with, and she had said to me that a group of people were spreading a rumour, that I had in some way offended against the person 33 years ago,” he said.   Related: MinterEllison confirms chief executive's departure a week after sending email on Christian Porter   Porter said the suggestion was put to him “just in the vaguest terms”. He said he did not have contact with the woman who had levelled the allegation since the late 1980s. Asked whether he had sought contact with her indirectly, Porter replied: “No.”  Hooke said he had made himself known to NSW police after his friend’s death. “In relation to any criminal prosecution, Christian Porter was manifestly and appropriately entitled to the presumption of innocence – it is essential to the rule of law,” he said. “In relation to any investigation of the important non-criminal aspects of this matter, I support an inquiry, like either that conducted by three retired eminent judges after Justice Lionel Murphy was acquitted of charges, or that conducted by Dr Vivienne Thom into allegations about Justice Heydon. “I am willing to testify under oath at any appropriately convened inquiry. “While I fully support the freedom of the press, I do not believe the media is the optimal forum in which to investigate a situation of this sensitivity and significance.” Another close friend of the woman who made the allegations, who had accompanied her to make a statement with New South Wales police in early 2020, had previously told Guardian Australia that Porter had dined with the woman “in the 1990s”.   Related: It is not too late, prime minister, to seek the advice of the solicitor general | Justin Gleeson   Porter has said he knew the woman for “the briefest periods at debating competitions when we were teenagers”. The attorney general twice suggested he had not seen the alleged victim since 1988 “to the best of my recollection”. A later statement from his office said it was “not impossible” there had been “some form of contact in the early-1990s”. The spokesperson added: “But the attorney general does not recollect any specific contact since 1988 in that period over three decades ago.” The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has resisted calls to hold an inquiry, saying it would damage Australia’s “rule of law”. Business and legal experts, including the former solicitor general Justin Gleeson, have said there would be no issue holding an independent inquiry. NSW police has publicly said on numerous occasions it did not investigate the matter, as the woman died before she made a formal statement and withdrew her complaint the day before it learned of her death. The woman had told police she felt unable to continue because of personal and health reasons. • In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14.

       "  'title': \"AI reveals 1,000 'dark discharges' of untreated sewage in England\",\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Nearly 1,000 “dark discharges” of untreated sewage from two water company treatment plants in England have been detected by scientists using artificial intelligence to map spills.  The use of machine learning to shine a light on the scale of pollution from untreated effluent being spilled into rivers could be a crucial tool in efforts to improve the quality of rivers, a paper says. Prof Peter Hammond, visiting scientist at the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, who co-authored the paper published in the journal Clean Water, used artificial intelligence to analyse data from two unidentified water companies’ waste treatment works from 2009 to 2018. The AI identified 926 “dark discharges” – or previously unknown spills – from the storm overflows at the two treatment plants. Discharges of untreated sewage from storm overflows, or CSOs, are permitted only in exceptional circumstances, such as extreme rainfall, the European commission has ruled. The spills identified by the AI included many during periods of unexceptional rainfall. Of these spills of untreated sewage, 360 discharged into rivers for a whole day, often spilling for more than 10 full days in a row. The impact of a full day of untreated sewage flowing into a river is particularly harmful, the authors said, because the spills involve the maximum flow of the most concentrated sewage, which creates the greatest risk of pollution. Such spills over several days were even more harmful. “Worse still is the pollution potential caused by an unbroken series of 24-hr untreated sewage spills during which a receiving watercourse has no respite nor opportunity to recover,” the paper said. Recent data from the Water Framework Directive shows the poor state of English rivers. Only 14% of English rivers are of good ecological standard, a rating that suggests they are as close to their natural state as possible. “Depending on the characteristics of the receiving river and the weather, these [spills] might be highly impactful discharges,” the report says. “It remains to be determined whether these ‘dark’ discharges could help to explain why 80% of surface water bodies in England are assigned a bad, poor or moderate status classification within the Water Framework Directive.” Hammond said machine learning could be helpful for water companies, the Environment Agency and for scientists to help reduce pollution from sewage spills. “Our objective was to develop techniques for analysing daily flow patterns and EDM data that could detect spills of untreated ‘storm tank overflow’ discharges into watercourses. We have shown that we can retrospectively identify spills or likely spills from the flow of the sewage being treated at the works,” he said. “This can inform the water companies which of their works are not functioning properly and it could help the Environment Agency identify gaps in compliance with permits to discharge wastewater. It can also help citizen and professional scientists interested in sewage-related pollution of watercourses.” The AI programme, the authors say, could be crucial to determining the scale of untreated sewage pouring into rivers because there remain many issues with the quality of the reported data. “Despite considerable environmental regulation and environmental impact, there remain gaps in our knowledge of the frequency, volume, and polluting effects from untreated sewage spills,” the authors said. One continuous spill of 60 days detected by the machine learning approach resulted in sewage fungus, which was also reported by members of the public. Water companies self-report on sewage pollution incidents to the Environment Agency but there is acknowledged underreporting. Many pollution spills are reported by watchful members of the public. In 2018, water companies reported 62% of pollution incidents, while the public reported 38% – nearly 400 incidents.\\n',\n",

       "  'full_article': 'New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has received what may be her greatest accolade yet: a large insect named in her honour. A new species of wētā – a giant flightless cricket that is endemic to New Zealand – has been named Hemiandrus jacinda for being Labour-party red in colour and “long-limbed”. Steven Trewick, a professor in evolutionary ecology at Massey University in New Zealand and the scientist who named and formally described the insect, said it had struck him for “reflecting traits of the prime minister”. It was a “striking species”, he said, and he considered it beautiful. The prime minister’s office said Ardern was “aware of this and very honoured”. A spokesperson added: “A beetle and a lichen, along with an ant in Saudi Arabia, have also been named after her.” More than 100 different species of wētā are found in trees, caves, bush and sometimes suburban gardens. As with all members of the Hemiandrus group, jacinda makes burrows in the ground, from which it emerges to hunt at night. The newly discovered species is bigger and more brightly coloured than the 17 ground wētā already recorded, and found in native forests in Northland, Bay of Plenty, Waikato and Coromandel in the upper North Island. It was described in the Zootaxa journal for the first time on Friday as “comparatively large, long-limbed, glossy and predominantly orange-red”. Trewick said it was remarkable that jacinda had evaded recognition until now, given that it had been found close to densely populated areas and that it was “not a small, cryptic beast but a hefty insect with flamboyant colouring”. It was proof that “in a time of accelerating environmental change, loss of natural habitat and global precipitous decline of the planet’s biological diversity, the work of species discovery continues,” he said. “The wētā of New Zealand are a rich and diverse radiation of species living in all sorts of habitats – yet many remain to be recognised.” But just as jacinda had been discovered, Trewick warned it was likely to be already declining in abundance on the slide towards extinction. Wētā are threatened by introduced predators such as rats and cats, and habitat loss and modification such as farmland. A key feature of the Department of Conservation’s work to conserve wētā is to classify them, with significant variation between the species despite their genetic similarity and large gaps in the knowledge of their distribution, abundance and ecology. It highlighted yet another commonality between the big cricket and the prime minister, said Trewick: “Both matter to New Zealand a great deal.”\\n',\n",

       "  'full_article': 'Gazelle Twin is the alter ego of Elizabeth Bernholz, a composer, producer and singer who creates unsettling, terrifying and occasional hilarious electronic music. Her stage costume resembles a Morris-dancing Leigh Bowery in Adidas trainers impersonating one of the droogs from Clockwork Orange. This retro-futurist court jester garb suited her remarkable 2018 album Pastoral, a febrile journey into the heart of middle England that mixed thuggish techno, menacing folk chants and lyrics that satirised old Albion and delved into its dark, paganistic roots.    Gazelle Twin & NYX: Deep England album cover Photograph: Publicity image   The album has had something of an afterlife: it was revived at the London jazz festival in 2019 as a semi-staged choral project, featuring Bernholz and the six-piece drone choir NYX, and has now been rerecorded as Deep England. Several tracks from Pastoral are radically reworked to become drum-free, drone-filled immersive soundscapes. Better in My Day, a study in nostalgic bigotry, is made creepier by replacing the thumping beats of the original with heavy breathing and rhythmic grunts. Fire Leap is a version of that spooky playground chant from The Wicker Man, accompanied by a demented perpetual canon played on two recorders.The voices of Bernholz and the women of NYX are digitally pitch-shifted to create freakishly low bass-baritone growls, as on Deep England, where they evoke a Gregorian chant choir. Throne is a nightmarish babble of watery effects that sounds like a ritualistic sacrifice by drowning; even more terrifying is Golden Dawn, which conjures images of a medieval basso profundo singing a threnody for England in a decommissioned power station, accompanied by electronic bleeps that sound like amplified water drips, and a microtonal choir put through endless layers of reverb. Like the rest of the album, it’s like a particularly gruesome horror movie that you feel the need to watch again and again. Also out this month No Such Thing As Free Will (Hush Hush Records) by Istanbul film composer Deniz Cuylan seems to invent new languages for the guitar: nylon-strung takes on Reichian minimalism, fluttering arpeggios that recall Vini Reilly’s spidery flamenco and atmospheric pieces pitched between Glenn Branca and Bert Jansch. Clark’s Playground in a Lake, his second LP for Deutsche Grammophon after 10 for Warp, alternates between metrical and hypnotic piano-led pieces, string-heavy drones and heavily textured electro-acoustic dystopias. New York violin duo String Noise’s album Alien Stories (Infrequent Seams) features five pieces by African American composers: the standouts are Yet to Be by Jonathan Finlayson (imagine bebop fragments reassembled as Schoenburg-style serialism), and La Púyala Muntá by Anaïs Maviel, mutilating the dancing, 6/8 rhythm of a Bach-style bourrée). \\n',\n",

       "  'full_article': 'Ex-con Schillinger (Ryan Francis) has been out of the big house long enough to start up his own business as a removal man, and has just hired two more employees, also prison alumni: tough Imani (Morgan Alexandria) and her friend, soft-spoken new father Carlos (Bryce Fernelius). All three have pasts they would like to put in the rear-view mirror of the moving van. But an offer from a creepy old man (Michael Flynn) with a German accent to do a quick overnight cash job will expose each person’s dark secrets and vulnerabilities, including piquing their perfectly natural curiosity when he tells them to shift everything in the mansion but stay out, per the title, of the attic. And the basement for that matter, but presumably director Jerren Lauder and his producers agreed Stay Out of the F**king Attic and Also the Basement wasn’t such a snappy title.    Of course, the employer’s command sets the movers in motion and it all comes out: Nazi pasts, monsters, and one unfortunate mover’s eyeball in a particularly gruesome interlude. Strictly in terms of generating jumpscares and gross-out moments this is efficient enough as a cinematic machine, but the script credited to four different people including Lauder hasn’t got a lot of finesse or subtlety. Even for allowing that horror films set in spooky old houses are supposed to be full of dark shadows and blackness, this is especially gloomily lit, so viewing on laptops is not recommended. Tension relieving laughs are few and far between, except for unintended guffaws that might be generated when one character skins part of their own anatomy; but the actor does such a poor job of expressing pain it looks like they merely stubbed their toe. • Stay Out of the F**king Attic is released on 11 March on Shudder.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'Karachi Vice by Samira Shackle review – life in the shadow of violence',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'When the British journalist Samira Shackle moved to Karachi, she was advised not to ask questions. The city was in flux: riots and gang battles sometimes shut down entire streets. Bombs went off on buses and in crowded spaces. Newspapers carried daily updates of the number of casualties. Wealthier homes and cafes were protected by security guards with metal detectors and AK-47s. Shackle stayed with her aunt in a safer – more affluent – neighbourhood. She grew used, as she writes, “to experiencing Karachi from the windows of a car”. Things were once different. In the 1960s and 70s, the city was a stopover on the hippie trail to India and Nepal. Tourists sunned themselves on its spotless beaches and partied in its casinos and nightclubs. A swelling population of partition-era refugees and Pashtun migrants ensured cheap labour that fuelled a period of economic growth. “Hashish was easily available,” the Pakistani journalist Nadeem F Paracha once wrote about those years, “but people still didn’t know what heroin or a Kalashnikov was”. Shackle, too, was lured in by the contradictions enmeshed in the city’s charm and danger. By the time she arrived in 2012, political parties and public officials had for decades been running a parallel economy with crime syndicates. Replenished by American and Saudi aid during the presidency of Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, the city’s affluent classes flourished, even as newer migrants, fleeing calamities elsewhere, were trapped in a cycle of diminishing resources and ethnic violence. Power cuts were frequent. Water had to be delivered in tankers. Mangroves and villages were lost to real estate projects. In Karachi Vice, Shackle tells the stories of five residents, carefully chosen to reflect different sides of the shadow city. There is Zille, a crime reporter who courts cops and mobsters alike for his scoops. A school teacher in a violent neighbourhood can only watch as her friends and family succumb to an influential ganglord. A Pashtun ambulance driver and a mohajir (a Muslim immigrant from India) surveyor are both driven by a wish to improve their lives. Then there is Jannat, whose ancestral village is being swallowed up by a murky private township near Karachi. Shackle excels at drawing out the incisive quote. Jannat is circumspect about the possibility of having to abandon her home. “You have to do these things,” she tells Shackle. “For your children.” Safdar, the ambulance driver, struggles to process the trauma of rescuing bodies from blast sites: “I don’t dwell on my memories. Memories are a prison.” Parveen, the teacher, can’t recall the good times in her neighbourhood. She doesn’t have to explain her reasons: “They snatched all the happiness from us.” But the book’s triumph is Zille, the one character whose motives aren’t always transparent. Shackle can never quite pin him down – he lies to her three times about his age – and yet the city comes to life through his eyes. His career overlaps with the gang wars that broke out at the turn of the millennium and the 2013 “Karachi Operation” approved by a newly elected Nawaz Sharif to weed out crime in the city. When a group of Taliban gunmen stormed into the city’s airport in June 2014, Zille sneaked inside during the siege to relay live updates. He ended up on the militants’ radar. “When you are on a terrorist hit list,” he tells Shackle, “everybody knows that you’re a real journalist.” The ordeals faced by Shackle’s protagonists seem to suit the powers that be just fine: behind the cover of violence and ethnic conflict there is good money to be made. Shackle is reluctant to insert herself into the narrative, but she is surely part of Karachi’s story, since her mother was born and brought up there. How does she herself perceive the city? In recent years, the city’s position in the World Crime Index has improved. On the face of it, the Karachi Operation would seem to have succeeded. But Shackle reveals horrifying instances of young men, some of them teenagers, who have disappeared after being picked up for questioning during the crackdown. Their families hang around funeral homes, searching for unidentified corpses. The nexus of crime, politics and business at the centre of the violence is still in place. Many gangs and militias have merely moved their kingpins out of the city. Work continues apace on the private township that threatens Jannat’s village. Farmlands and settlements are being razed to build a gated banlieue with “world-class” amenities. In photographs of the area, you can spot a replica of the Eiffel Tower being built on a distant hill. • Karachi Vice is published by Granta (£14.99). To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com.

       "  'title': 'I learned the hard way that racial identity matters | Georgina Lawton',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'What constitutes your personal identity? It’s a question you might not have considered before. Perhaps it’s never bothered you. The topic of what makes us who we are, and our sense of self, has been discussed since the origins of western philosophy. The central theme in some of the world’s most famous novels, such as Charlotte Brontë’s Jane Eyre, Charles Dickens’ Great Expectations and JK Rowling’s Harry Potter is one of identity and the search for self. Yet defining who we are proves notoriously tricky. Some may think identity as being forged through seminal moments – the birth of a child; perhaps a marriage. Many people see a personal identity as correlating with their ethnicity, nationality, or racial background.  The sociologist Stuart Hall believed that cultural identities are subject to change, and belong “to the future as much as to the past”. Cultural identities originate from somewhere, they have histories, he said. But how do you identify if you are misled about your own history? Or when your view of yourself does not match up with how others see you? I examine all this in my book, Raceless, which traces my attempts to piece together the truth about my heritage. I was told by both parents that I was white, but in my early 20s discovered my biological father was black. In researching this, which also involved a podcast series, The Secrets in Us, I also discovered the stories of many others who were misled about their personal identities. After years of believing my own story to be utterly bizarre, it was oddly reassuring to draw points of reference from others around the world. There was the mixed-race girl in her 20s from Florida who, like me, was raised to believe she was the child of two white parents. Both of us confirmed our black parentage from ancestral DNA testing. There was the Welshman, also mixed-race, who was passed off as fully white by his white mother, who raised him alone. In a cruel twist of fate, just before he tracked down his black family in London, vitiligo robbed him of his phenotypical blackness and he now passes as a white man. Then there was the London-based businessman in his 40s who contacted me to share a story almost identical to my own: his blackness was ignored by his parents because, he later found out, his mother had had an affair with a black man in Paris. I interviewed the musician Shovell, of the band M People, who was always told that his white parents had adopted him. Although he identified as black, the truth later emerged that the woman who had raised him was, in fact, his biological mother. I also found there to be parallels of racial or cultural erasure between my experiences and that of some Nigerian-born children fostered by white families. Each of these stories is deeply layered and complex, yet they all centre around the control of a child’s identity to ensure the comfort of the parents. In many cases blackness was only accepted if it was overlooked: tolerated but not celebrated. Shame also played a huge role – shame around a child’s difference, shame in relation to a woman’s extramarital affair. And shame around who you are can often manifest itself in self-inflicted abuse of the body. My own teenage years were marred by an eating disorder. Loving, affectionate relationships with white caregivers can be pushed to breaking point when it emerges that the child’s cultural background or parentage has been obscured from them. The psychological impact of discovering deception of this kind is massive: people told me they felt furious at being robbed of a key part of their identity. The process of rebuilding and re-deciphering their story after a lifetime of believing it to be something else was hugely destabilising: depression, PTSD and grief were common. As Shovell told me: “I was deeply, deeply, deeply scarred. Immediately. PTSD doesn’t only happen to soldiers on a battlefield.” In hearing so many stories like this, it has become clear to me that withholding information that is fundamental to a child’s self-development is a cruel form of identity erasure, warping realities and often leaving emotional scars that take years to heal. I don’t believe that black children raised within white homes have to endure pain and suffering. A transracial home does not need to be a synonym for trauma if it is a place of openness and honest dialogue; from my experience I would say that imbuing a child with a sense of pride around all aspects of their identity is key. Ensuring they are surrounded by “racial mirrors” (successful role models who look like them) will help raise their aspirations. Discussing and celebrating difference when children start to notice it will lead to positive associations. What is absolutely the wrong approach is the colour-blind one. Accepting racial difference only by pretending not to see it keeps families separate and distant. It stilts relationships and creates a damaging silence around who the child really is. When lies are at the heart of the home, it is impossible for children to trust their caregivers, and sometimes other people too. They can grow up believing there is something unspeakably wrong with them. Love is not enough, I know this from experience. It is up to parents to ensure their children are not left to decipher race, and what it means for them, on their own.

       "  'title': \"Lucy Bronze: 'It’s taken a while for coaches to really understand the person I am'\",\n",
       "  'full_article': '“It’s funny because when I was younger I was so awkward socially,” says Lucy Bronze. “I was so lucky that I had sport and was good at sport because it’s the only way I knew how to interact with people.” The Manchester City defender has been delving into the past. On International Women’s Day she posted a video to her Instagram of a nervous looking young Bronze, on a windy pitch, turning towards the camera with knuckles held close to her face, then it cuts to her having a chance on goal. “My mum’s been pulling out a few videos and pictures recently and on these things you can just see the awkwardness on my face. It’s quite funny to see how I’ve grown. I’ve grown a lot over the years and it’s nice to see that change.”   Related: FA sorry for telling players of Olympic omission 90 minutes before game   Interestingly, in the newly announced Team GB manager Hege Riise, a former World Cup, European and Olympic champion, Bronze has found a manager who seems to understand that more reserved side. “I like Hege,” says Bronze. “Hege and [the assistant manager] Rhian [Wilkinson], they work together like Batman and Robin, it’s quite interesting how the two personalities mash together because they’re so different.” Riise and Wilkinson spent time with each player during England’s February camp, their first, to learn more about them and in Riise Bronze found a kindred spirit. “I was talking to Hege about what kind of person I am and she just laughed,” says Bronze with a grin. “I was like: ‘Oh, you know, the Covid restrictions are hard but I enjoy being by myself, I like being in a room, I like been focused, I like to train. Some of the other girls go crazy, they need to go and get their coffee, they need to socially interact with each other all day or they lose their minds.’    Lucy Bronze returned to Manchester City last summer after three years at Lyon. Photograph: Tom Flathers/The FA   “She just laughed and said: ‘No Lucy, I understand you’ and I thought: ‘Oh, this is nice. I’ve got a coach that must have been the same sort of player.’ “In the past, not with Phil [Neville] or anything, I think I’ve been misunderstood or it’s taken a while for coaches to really understand the person that I am, because I’m just a little bit different to the other girls. Straightaway, she said: ‘No, Lucy, I understand’ and I was like: ‘That is music to my ears’.” In England’s 6-0 friendly victory over Northern Ireland during that camp, Bronze looked like a player on a mission and finished the game with two assists and a goal. “Playing for England at the minute is enjoyable,” she says. “The new coaches have given me a pretty free rein, which is probably why I got two assists and a goal because they said we know what we can get from you, you go and do you.” That game was sandwiched by impressive performances for Manchester City, including the opening goal in a 3-0 derby win against United, that earned Bronze the Barclays WSL player of the month award for February. She rejoined City from European champions Lyon last summer to be closer to the England team and at City she plays with a host of her international teammates. England are benefiting and so are City.    Lucy Bronze scores England’s third against Northern Ireland in the 6-0 win at St George’s Park. Photograph: Naomi Baker - The FA/The FA/Getty Images   “It does make it a lot easier that, even though I’ve been carrying injuries, I’ve not had to focus on all the things that come with being in a new team and trying to settle in, I’ve been able to just focus a lot on my side of the game,” Bronze says. “I can feel that the decision [to come back] was right. I’ve had a bigger impact on things than probably what I did this time last year, even though we’ve had Covid, which has obviously limited a lot of things with camps or games or interactions with people.” One player benefiting from having the world’s best full-back behind her is the 23-year-old forward Chloe Kelly. Their relationship is looking increasingly instinctive. “Coming from Everton, Chloe was heavily relied on for goals, for assisting goals, making goals, scoring goals,” Bronze says. “So I think it’s been good her to come to a team where she could maybe relax a little bit more, the pressure’s not on her. She’s still so young. At the start of the season I was like: ‘Chloe, you do know you can pass to me? I can do these things, too.’ “As the season has gone on, particularly most recently, our relationship has developed and we’re starting to create movements together, create goals together and it’s not just one of us doing it on our own.”   Related: Manchester City Women thrash Fiorentina to reach quarter-finals   The mentoring role is still new to Bronze, but she is increasingly enjoying it: “A couple of years ago I probably felt a little bit like I wasn’t really a senior member of the teams that I was playing in. Over the past two years that’s kind of changed. “There’s a lot of players who come to me now and ask me questions. It took a while for it to click in my head and think that they’re asking me questions because they really look up to me or they think I’ve got the answers or I’ve got the experience. Once that clicked in my head I’ve enjoyed it. Obviously Chloe and Lauren Hemp, at City, I get on well with Lauren James, and when she was at England, she was texting me every day like: ‘Lucy can we have a chat. I want to do this, I want to do that, what should I want to do?’ The great thing is is that they’re all hungry to learn and if you want to ask questions, I’m open to helping anyone and answering because I want England and I want English players to improve and be the best in the world as well.” Is Bronze back to her best after niggles that affected her return at City? “Not yet, no,” she says. “I feel like I’m getting better, settling in better. I’m just fixing a few things with my body at the moment, but I’m definitely improving as the season goes on. The team is as well.” Lucy Bronze is the Barclays WSL player of the month for February.

       "  'title': \"Australian archives agency is allowing 'national treasures' to deteriorate, internal review finds\",\n",
       "  'full_article': \"The funding-starved National Archives of Australia is allowing documents to deteriorate, potentially against its legal obligations, and is struggling to meet its mandate to preserve government records and make them public, a damning review has found. In January 2020, ex-senior public servant David Tune handed the federal government an internal review of the function and efficiency of the National Archives of Australia. The government has sat on the report since then, and has resisted making it public, despite freedom of information requests from independent senator Rex Patrick.   Related: John Kerr's letters to the Queen's private secretary: 'A raw display of devastation'   The NAA released the review late Friday afternoon, following the Guardian asking questions about it earlier on Friday. The report made several startling findings. It found the NAA was “struggling” to meet its mandate “to secure, preserve and make public, the archival resources of the Commonwealth”. “In particular, the National Archives has struggled to fulfil its mandate and to invest in the systems it needs in the digital age to meet this mandate,” the report said. “Resources are needed to invest in contemporary technologies that will meet the volume of digital transfer, preservation, storage, declassification, and public access required under the Act.” The review noted the NAA has been defunded and starved of resources. The strain on resources has harmed its service delivery and led to redundancies. “As observed in recent independent audits, this has impacted the National Archives service delivery to both government and the Australian public.” The report identified an immediate and pressing concern: that the NAA is allowing the “deterioration of many records” that it holds. This, it found, was a potential breach of the Archives Act. “Limited capacity in the Archives means that many records (in a variety of forms) will be lost if action is not taken. As such, the National Archives could potentially be in breach of Part 5 Section 24 of the Act due to unauthorised loss of records.” The report said the NAA was also failing to respond to “requests for records within the period defined in the Act”. “Long response times were highlighted in many public submissions to this review and have also attracted media attention for some time,” the review said. “Part of this criticism relates to the time taken by the National Archives to obtain advice from other agencies (particularly for security related and other sensitive records) before it can take decisions on whether to declassify records and release them.”   Related: National archives' 90-day delay to declassify palace letters 'extremely disappointing'   The report was finally released publicly after it was provided to Patrick through FoI. The independent senator said the FoI should not have been necessary. “It is unfortunate that it was necessary to have to resort to an FoI application to secure the release of a major report on the principal institution responsible for safeguarding and making available to the public the historical records of the Australian Government,” he said. “Mr Tune’s report should have been published as soon as it was submitted to the government.” Patrick said it was “worrying” to read that the deterioration of records required immediate action. “The National Archives is charged with responsibility for safeguarding what are national treasures; documents that tell our nation’s history – from big political decisions down to the service records of individual Defence Force personnel or the immigration files of the millions of people who have come from overseas to make Australia their home,” he said. “The vast and fragile photographic collections of the National Archives are a unique and irreplaceable part of our nation’s visual history.” “It’s worrying, therefore, to read Mr Tune’s assessment that the deterioration of many records held in the Archives requires immediate action.”\\n\",\n",

       "  'title': \"Israel 'bombed a dozen ships carrying Iranian oil or weapons in past two years'\",\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Israel has bombed at least a dozen ships en route to Syria in the past two years, most of which have been carrying Iranian oil, the Wall Street Journal has reported, citing US and regional officials. The attacks, which the article said included water mines in the Red Sea and other areas of the region, would, if confirmed, suggest a new front in the semi-covert conflict between arch-foes Israel and Iran. Israel has conducted hundreds of aerial bombings against Iranian forces and their allies in neighbouring Syria, but it has not indicated if it has also been conducting strikes at sea. Officials do not usually comment on alleged military action and did not confirm or deny the Wall Street Journal claims. Some of the naval attacks blocked Iranian efforts to move weaponry in the region, the US media outlet reported. Oil shipments were targeted “out of concern that petroleum profits are funding extremism in the Middle East”. The strikes did not sink any tankers but forced at least two to return to port in Iran, it added. Iran did not immediately comment on the report. The revelations follow two recent incidents involving tankers that have raised tensions between the two countries. First was a blast on an Israeli-owned ship, the Helios Ray, in the Gulf of Oman last month. Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, blamed the explosion on Iran, saying: “Iran is the greatest enemy of Israel. I am determined to halt it. We are hitting it in the entire region.” Iran denied the claim. Second, Israel announced that a recent tar spill that ravaged its shores was caused by a tanker carrying Iranian oil bound for Syria. Beachgoers and cleanup crews have found baby turtles and fish covered in black sludge. The Israeli environmental protection minister, Gila Gamliel, went as far as to suggest the incident was intentional, calling it a form of “environmental terrorism”. However, that claim was widely rebuffed by other officials, who said it was a leak. There was no suggestion or evidence that the tanker may have been hit by one of the alleged Israeli strikes reported by the Wall Street Journal. Iranian state TV separately reported on Friday that an Iranian cargo vessel was targeted this week in a “terrorist attack” in the Mediterranean. There were no casualties in the explosion, the report said. The report quoted Ali Ghiasian, a spokesperson for the state shipping line, as saying that Wednesday’s attack damaged Shahr-e Kord, a commercial vessel travelling to Europe. Ghiasian said an “explosives device” damaged the hull of the ship and set off a small fire that was quickly extinguished. The report said the ship would continue on its path following a damage assessment, without providing more details. It did not blame anyone for the alleged attack.  Israel often coordinates its military activities with the US, or at least informs its key ally. However, the country is concerned that the new administration in Washington will take a softer approach on Iran than that of Donald Trump. Joe Biden has plans to resurrect a US-Iran nuclear deal that is opposed by Israel as it considers Iran to be an uncooperative “terrorist regime”. Meanwhile, officials in Iran have accused Israel of “military adventurism”, and Tehran alleged that its enemy assassinated its top nuclear scientist last year, a claim Israel denies. The Israeli military accused Iranian forces of firing rockets at its troops in 2018.\\n',\n",

       "  'full_article': 'The 10-tournament online $1.5m Meltwater Champions Tour resumes on Saturday at 4pm, free and live online, with the $200,000 Magnus Carlsen Invitational, and another testing day for the below par world No 1. Carlsen has missed out on first place in four successive events since his 30th birthday in November. Online, Carlsen has twice finished behind America’s Wesley So and once behind Azerbaijan’s Teimour Radjabov; while over-the-board at Tata Steel Wijk aan Zee, Carlsen trailed in sixth place, his worst placing at the “chess Wimbledon” for more than a decade, The shock Netherlands winner at Wijk, Jorden van Foreest, 21, was rewarded with a wildcard place on the Tour.   Related: Chess: Levon Aronian switches to US as new regime in Armenia cuts support   The Invitational starts with a 16-player all-play-all spread over three days, qualifying its top eight for the knock-out stage. Carlsen’s first four pairings are all awkward. The world champion begins with Van Foreest, for whom victory over the No 1 would evoke distant memories of 1935 when Max Euwe captured the world crown from Alexander Alekhine. Carlsen’s next three opponents are France’s No 1, Maxime Vachier-Lagrave, the halfway leader in the world title candidates due to resume in Ekaterinburg next month, the fast rising star Alireza Firouzja, 17, who is on the verge of breaking into the world top 10, and is widely regarded as heir apparent to Carlsen’s throne; and finally the Norwegian’s long-standing arch-rival, verbal and social media critic Anish Giri, who was within touching distance of winning Wijk in January until faltering in the last seconds of his Armageddon game with Van Foreest. The early years of world champions are always interesting to examine for clues to special factors sparking a surge in form which their later followers can try to emulate. Bobby Fischer and His World by John Donaldson (Siles Press, 644 pages, £26) and Vasily Smyslov: The Early Years 1921-1948 by Andrey Terekhov (Russell Enterprises, 556 pages, £33) are highly readable books based on impressive research, and both highlight such critical moments. Donaldson claims that Fischer’s quantum jump from age 12, when he was an also-ran in the bottom half of the US Junior and US Amateur, to age 13 when he played his famous Game of the Century, is the fastest ever improvement for a high level player. In current rating terms Fischer advanced around 700 points, from 1700 to 2400, in around 12-15 months. One secret was his concentrated high-class activity, both as a player and as a student of the game. Fischer was exceptionally elected to membership of New York’s prestigious Manhattan Club. where the normal age limit was 18. He played incessant five-minute blitz against strong opponents, and he even acquired international experience on a high board for the Log Cabin club’s visit to Cuba. At that time professional players in Britain and Western Europe were preparing openings with the aid of Chess Archives, edited by Euwe in the Netherlands, and were starting to add Soviet publications like Schachmatny Bulletin for up-to-date theory. Fischer knew them both, taught himself sufficient Russian to understand tournament bulletins from Moscow, and absorbed it all with his fast and accurate memory. By mid-1956 he had advanced from the bottom half of the US Junior to winning it with a near-maximum score, and was already finishing high up in the US Open. Donaldson analyses and chronicles both Bobby’s rise and his later fall as his anti-semitic fixation took over his life.   Related: Chess: US giants fail as Grenke Bank win first World Corporate Championship   Smyslov also had an unusual career start. He was coached by his father, a strong master who had once defeated the legendary Alexander Alekhine in a tournament, and only began play outside his family at 14. There was a lucky break at 18, when he was called up for military service in 1940 during the Soviet invasion of Finland and rejected due to poor eyesight. That may have led, decades later, to his habit of peering at the board, then making a move to a new square with an individualistic screwing motion. Smyslov had luck, too, in the mid-1940s when he had rivals in the race to become No 2 in the USSR behind Mikhail Botvinnik. Soviet officials wanted reliable team players, so were impressed when Smyslov scored 7.5/8 in the radio and over-the-board matches against the US and Britain in 1945-47, helped by a critical time pressure moment in his second game against Samuel Reshevsky, who blundered by 39 Ne4?? when 39 Nb7!

       "  'title': \"'Just give him the ball': the unsinkable Luka Dončić and the hope of audacity\",\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Deep into the third quarter of a game against Orlando Magic earlier this month, the Dallas Mavericks were defending with a 13-point lead when they snatched the ball and quickly transitioned. Four blue shirts flitted forward downcourt, outnumbering Orlando’s lone defender, until Luka Dončić collected the ball inches from the rim. The best young baller in the world had a simple lay-up before him, but passed it up for the spectacular play: attempting a backwards, no-look bounce pass to where he thought Maximillian Kleber would be arriving. Kleber, however, had stopped running and the pass found no one at all. Within 30 seconds, the lead would shrink to seven points. For some athletes, the indignity of such an elementary mistake might make them think twice before attempting the same thing again. But that is not how Luka Dončić plays basketball. In his short time in the NBA, one of his shining qualities is his audacity. He goes about his work with joy and deep conviction in his ability, which translates to him being unafraid of expressing his talent to the fullest with the most difficult, outrageous passes and shot attempts. A few minutes into the fourth quarter, he rectified his mistake with an identical pass, this time with the added difficulty of being airbound. “You’re constantly talking to players about not jumping in the air and trying to make decisions,” Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said afterwards, laughing. “I mean, this guy defies a lot of logic when it comes to conventional coaching theories.  Luka Doncic  “That’s why we give him the ball and let him go.” For the past two and a half seasons, watching Dončić take the ball and go has become one of the most exhilarating sights in sports. He is 6ft 7in with a sturdy frame, but his talents are delicate and pure. He uses his court sense and bottomless toolbox of trickery to humiliate defenders and executes passes that most cannot even see in their dreams. Despite using the ball for so many of the Mavericks’ possessions and deciding the final minutes of most games himself, he is paradoxically unselfish, constantly seeking out teammates and making their lives easier by creating space for them. Since his arrival on US soil in 2018, coaches and pundits have frequently described Dončić as playing the game at his own pace. He does, but sometimes the implication is that his guile makes up for his complete dearth of athleticism. Dončić is some distance from the optimum shape he may one day achieve, but his footwork, agility and the sheer control he has over his body as he drives into the paint to beat his man, accelerating and decelerating at will, is a supreme athletic feat in itself. The starting point for Doncic’s 2020-21 season truly came six months ago in the Disney World bubble when his vicious bullying of quality teams culminated in the masterpiece of his NBA career so far: a 43-point, 17-rebound, 13-assist eruption against the Los Angeles Clippers in Game 4 of the Western Conference quarter-finals, a manic display punctuated with a game-winning three-pointer at the buzzer. After two years of filling up the stat sheet for a team that generally draws a fraction of the attention as the NBA’s coastal goliaths, this was the moment his name burst into the stratosphere. He is now a two-time All-Star starter, a member of last year’s All-NBA first team and, on Wednesday, logged his 33rd career triple-double, landing him joint 11th on the all-time list at just 22 years old. He is also now the undeniable leader of the Mavericks. By the start of this season, he was being tabbed as an early MVP favorite. Things have not exactly gone to plan. Dončić was caught out by the decision to start the new season in November and entered it out of shape. His first step was slower, his three-pointer “couldn’t make it in the pool”, in his words. As he quickly worked back to step, the team itself collapsed. Four key players – Jalen Brunson, Josh Richardson, Kleber and Dorian Finney-Smith – were sidelined due to Covid protocols, while Kristaps Porziņģis struggled with his form and movement on his return from meniscus surgery. By the first week of February, Dallas were 14th of 15 teams in the Western Conference standings and on a six-game losing streak that dropped their record to 9-14. This was all an unfamiliar feeling for Dončić. Throughout his career, he has always been a winner. He was crowned EuroLeague MVP for Real Madrid at 19, and was a leading contributor in Slovenia’s EuroBasket victory the year before, following a youth spent mercilessly battering his contemporaries in Ljubljana. After a blowout loss to Utah Jazz at the end of January, he sounded helpless. “Terrible,” he said. “I never felt like this. We’ve got to do something, because this is not looking good. We’ve got to step up and just talk to each other and play way better than this. It’s mostly effort.”    Luka Dončić drives to the basket during the first half of a February game against the Hawks at Atlanta’s State Farm Arena. Photograph: Todd Kirkland/Getty Images   The struggles have presented Dončić in a different light on and off the court. He demonstrated how complete his game is by smartly adjusting to his reality at the beginning of the season. To make up for his slower first step, he began to take a dramatically higher volume of mid-range shots and found immediate success. His defense, often singled out as a weakness, has continued to chart improvement. As critics still questioned his form, he embarked on a personal record of 14 consecutive games with at least 25 points. Criticism will always follow success and the self-awareness with which Dončić has navigated increased scrutiny this year underlines why he has reached these heights so soon in the first place. Even in a world of vicious armchair analysts across social media, there is no harsher critic of Dončić than himself. His explanations to unconvinced reporters that he couldn’t possibly be playing well if his team is losing, even as he’s been nearly averaging a triple-double on the season, have become a common trope. And when his frequent lobbying of referees came under fire, rather than responding defensively when the subject was raised, he owned up to it and pledged to stop. He has mostly kept quiet since. Since the middle of February, the tide has slowly turned for the Mavericks as the team has shaken off Covid and all the complications it has wrought on their season. Dallas have now won 10 of their last 12 games, propelling themselves from 14th to eighth and into the thick of the playoff hunt. It’s also brought the re-emergence of Dončić’s three-pointer, which now looks as polished than ever. He is taking smarter shots and veering more to his favorite spot on the left, but remains capable of exploding from any part of the court and at any time: as the Boston Celtics learned the hard way when he drained a pair of three-pointers in the final 17 seconds to win the game. A grueling second-half slate of 38 games in 68 days will test Dončić’s fitness to its limits, but the weeks, months and years to come are squarely on his side.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': \"News Corp Australia papers labelled 'sexist' and 'toxic' by former staff photographer at media inquiry \",\n",
       "  'full_article': \"A veteran News Corp Australia photographer has given devastating evidence to a parliamentary inquiry about the way the Murdoch newspapers treated female employees and directed photographers to only take pictures of conventionally attractive young women. Anna Rogers, who was made redundant last year, told the media diversity inquiry she worked in a sexist and toxic culture at Cumberland Newspapers, the Australian, the Courier-Mail and the Cairns Post between 1991 and 2020, where men were consistently promoted over women.   Related: Kevin Rudd declares end to 'the age of male sexual entitlement'   Women were denied pay rises and flexible work hours and she believed all staff were forced to sign employment contracts which gave the company the right to “listen in” to their phone calls, she told senators. Rogers said she had been consistently told not to take pictures of “pigs in lipstick” while the appearance of male subjects was never raised. In 1994, when Paul Kelly was editor-in-chief of the Australian, she was told to take photographs of attractive women to increase female readership. “During a news conference the editor Paul Kelly indicated to the news conference staff that the Australian wanted to increase female readership,” Rogers said in her submission. “His argument was that women buy women’s magazines and that they like to look at attractive women.” In 2011, a picture editor at Queensland’s Sunday Mail ordered social photographers not to take any pictures of any “pigs in lipstick”, which was interpreted to mean any middle-aged women or those who may be overweight or not conventionally attractive. “While working on the Courier-Mail, I was encouraged to seek out attractive women to photograph to ‘get a better run’ in the Courier-Mail,” she said. “This meant the photo would run in the earlier pages of the paper if the subject was attractive.”  Former Murdoch reporters turning out in force to testify at the Senate Inquiry initiated following our #MurdochRoyalCommission petition.

She said the culture was “extremely derogatory to women” but she had to comply with directions from the editors and there was no avenue for dissent or complaint.    Rogers during her years at the Cairns Post. Photograph: Veronica Sagredo   “To keep my job, I had to apply this test which meant that women who were over 35, were overweight, were not photographed for the paper,” Rogers said. “While employed at the Cairns Post 2011 to 2020 I was encouraged to take photos of attractive young women, with instructions such as, ‘Get a photo of a yummy mummy,’ or, ‘Get a photo of a pretty tourist.’ “Again, there was the explanation that a photo of an attractive person would get a better run in the paper. “I feel that this emphasis on the appearance of women has diminished the chance of being treated equally to men in the media. There was never a direction to get a photo of a ‘handsome man’. “I believe this emphasis on women’s looks has fostered sexism in our society. As a woman working in the media, the emphasis on the appearance of women made me feel compromised and uncomfortable.” Female politicians and wives of sportsmen, or wags, were derided for what they wore while men were treated on merit, she said. In mid-2019, subscription targets were introduced, she said, and staff became very stressed about having to sign on readers or miss a target. A managing editor at the Cairns Post sent an email to all editorial staff that year saying “as you can imagine i get forensically anal-ised that’s not a spelling mistake about our subscription targets”.   Related: News Corp gives Kevin Rudd the silent treatment | The Weekly Beast   Rogers said a lack of diversity had allowed News Corp to descend from a reputable company to one where “women are considered as pigs in lipstick, with a toxic work culture where even the managing editor feels he is being forensically anal-ised”. She said: “The contract that we all had to sign gave the company the right to listen into our phone conversations. And you couldn’t get a job with News Corp without signing that.” She also said she had not been given bushfire training, she had been told to clean the company toilets during Covid, and she had not been provided with personal protective equipment except for a single mask. “I believe that the clickbait culture has created a toxic culture where staff get intimidated and bullied,” she said. Senators also heard from the Guardian Australia editor, Lenore Taylor, who said the news website was established in 2013 partly in response to the lack of media diversity in Australia. Taylor said Guardian Australia contributed to media diversity in the country but could not be seen as a counter-balance to the dominance of News Corp Australia and Nine Entertainment because it was relatively small. Guardian Australia did not have the capacity to cover state politics, courts or many specialist rounds, she said. It employed 112 full-time equivalent staff including 76 journalists. Taylor was asked about her previous experiences working at News Corp and she said she was never directed to write something while reporting for the Australian. However, she said she would occasionally get briefs from news conference in her second stint at the paper after 2007, and when she didn’t agree with the brief she would push back and editors would drop it or give it to another reporter.

Klan, a Walkley award-winning finance reporter at the Australian for 15 years, revealed he had a significant investigation spiked after lobbying from Westpac. He was called into the office of then-editor John Lehmann to discuss the story and there were several Westpac executives on speakerphone during the meeting. “I was told I was not permitted to speak, although the meeting was held over speakerphone and only Lehmann spoke from the Australian’s end,” Klan told the inquiry. “On the other line, there were up to a dozen Westpac executives and lawyers. What ensued was all aimed at preventing the story from being published.” Veteran News Corp journalist Tony Koch told the inquiry the company had taken a “huge right turn” since he first began his career more than 30 years ago. He said the organisation favoured the LNP and ignored negative stories about the conservative political party. Koch won the Walkley award five times for his work at News Corp but has become a vehement critic in recent years. Lehmann and the Australian were approached for comment.\\n\",\n",

       "  'full_article': \"The former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull has said allowing people to withdraw from their retirement savings to help buy a house is “the craziest idea I’ve heard” and lashed politicians for being patronising by denying ordinary Australians an increase in the superannuation rate. Appearing on Friday at an event organised by Industry Super Australia, Turnbull also took aim at “really poor arguments” against raising the super contribution rate from the current 9.5% that have been advanced by what he called “former colleagues of mine for whom I have respect and affection”. The Victorian backbencher Tim Wilson has campaigned for super to be cracked open so that people can buy houses under the slogan “home first, super second”, promising Australians they will have “a better life and a better retirement”.   Related: 'You might have to sell your home': industry super launches social media blitz to fight cuts   But Turnbull said Australia had a housing affordability problem and allowing money to flow out of super accounts and into the property market would make it worse. “Diverting even more savings into housing is simply just going to bid up the price of housing,” he said. “I mean, that is, honestly, that’s the worst possible argument.” The rate at which employers contribute to super is legislated to increase from 9.5% to 10% in July this year, before rising to 12% by 2025, but Wilson and other backbenchers have campaigned against the increase. They have claimed that super increases come out of wages, a claim that is supported by some economists but disputed by others and dismissed by the former prime minister Paul Keating, who introduced compulsory superannuation in 1992. “Politicians and public servants have a compulsory 15.4% super contribution that was determined, presumably a very long time ago, because it was felt that that was an appropriate level to provide sufficient savings for retirement,” Turnbull said. “So isn’t it somewhat at odds, somewhat patronising, for people who benefit from 15.4% super, to say that working people should be, should you know settle for nine and a half?” Industry Super Australia’s event marked the launch of a report the body commissioned from the economists Acil Allen on the effect of increasing the super guarantee rate as planned on the Australian economy.   Related: Government's super changes a 'gift' to for-profit sector, industry funds claim   Acil Allen said increasing the rate would increase GDP by about $12bn a year by 2040. “Contrary to much of what has been said in the public debate on the rise in the SG [superannuation guarantee] rate, apart from a very small and very short-lived effect, there is no trade-off between higher superannuation contributions and higher wages,” it said in the report. “In fact, an increase in the SG rate, because it will lead to more capital accumulation and a bigger economy, will lead to higher real wages.”\\n\",\n",

       "  'title': 'Exports to EU plunge by 40% in first month since Brexit',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'UK exports of goods to the EU plunged by 40.7% in January as the first month since Brexit and the imposition of a new Covid lockdown resulted in the biggest monthly decline in British trade for more than 20 years. In the first month since leaving the EU on terms agreed by Boris Johnson’s government, the Office for National Statistics said goods exports to the bloc fell by £5.6bn, while imports fell by 28.8%, or £6.6bn.   Related: Labour suggests ministers failed to do analysis of Brexit deal   Exports of food and live animals to the EU were the hardest hit by Brexit, collapsing by 63.6% in January. Consignments of fish and shellfish collapsed by 83% from the level a year ago to only £16m. This reflected heavier disruption and additional checks for consignments from this sector that prompted furious protests from the fishing industry. However, food and live animals account for only 7% of total UK exports.  UK exports  After stockpiling and disruption at UK borders in the run-up to the Brexit transition, the decline also came as the economy in January shrank by the largest amount since the first wave of the pandemic, with gross domestic product (GDP) falling 2.9% from December, according to the ONS. The ONS said the January performance was the worst since monthly records began in 1997, as a 1.7% rise in non-EU trade, worth £200m, failed to make up for the plunge in cross-border activity with the UK’s biggest trading partner. Overall, global UK exports and imports fell by about a fifth.   Related: UK forced to delay checks on imports from EU by six months   Although January’s GDP figure represents the biggest contraction since the first lockdown almost a year ago, analysts had forecast a bigger decline of 4.9%, suggesting that businesses and households adapted better to harsh restrictions than during the first wave of the pandemic, when GDP fell by more than 20% in April 2020. Experts said the scale of the decline in January trade was unlikely to be permanent because there was evidence companies stockpiled goods before the Brexit deadline, meaning they would not need to send as many shipments as usual in January. The decline was lower than a 68% plunge reported by road hauliers, while the ONS said there were signs trade had started to pick up at the end of the month.  UK GDP  The closure of shops during the Covid-19 lockdown reduced demand for clothing shipments, car production fell and exports were weak to EU countries as tougher coronavirus restrictions were imposed across the continent. Alongside stockpiling, Covid disruption and lockdown, the ONS also changed the way it collects export data after Brexit, which could mean it takes longer to record some UK goods shipped to the EU. The prime minister’s former chief Brexit negotiator Lord Frost said there was a “unique combination of factors” that meant it was “inevitable that we would see some unusual figures this January”. Frost, who was elevated last month to become the cabinet minister responsible for Britain’s relationship with the EU, said these effects were now “starting to unwind” and that overall freight volumes had been “back to their normal levels for over a month now”. However, one economist said Brexit played a decisive role in January and would continue to weigh on growth. “Brexit made a bad situation worse,” said Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics. “Brexit is best seen as a slow puncture, rather than a sudden blowout, with the costs gradually accumulating in the form of lower investment and immigration than otherwise would have been the case.”  UK exports  In a reflection of the Brexit impact, UK goods exports to Ireland fell 47% in January, the sharpest fall among main trading partners. While the government has admitted to “teething problems” at the start of the new relationship, business leaders have warned that lengthier delivery times and higher costs are likely to remain as an endemic feature of Brexit. Suren Thiru, the head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: “The practical difficulties faced by businesses on the ground go well beyond just teething problems and with disruption to UK-EU trade flows persisting, trade is likely to be a drag on UK economic growth in the first quarter of 2021.”   Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk  It comes as the government was forced this week to delay the introduction of further post-Brexit import checks by six months – a U-turn because a network of 30 border posts being built to process incoming goods would not have been ready on time. A government spokesman said the figures did not reflect the overall EU-UK trading relationship post Brexit. “Many businesses have adapted well, and our focus now is on making sure that any business that is still facing challenges gets the support they need to trade effectively with the EU.”\\n',\n",

       "  'full_article': \"The AFL will embrace technology in the rollout of two major concussion projects during the 2021 season in an effort to better understand head trauma and how to protect the health and safety of its players. The league on Friday wrote to clubs to encourage them to participate in the studies, which will use eye tracking technology and “smart” mouthguards to collect data. The projects, named Bio-Eye and HitIQ, are the latest attempts by the league to address the issue of long-term effects of concussion.   Related: AFL concussion rules to be examined in Shane Tuck coroner's inquiry   Bio-Eye is an eye tracking technology that provides objective data the AFL hopes can supplement the subjective data and information that is already used by medical teams. HitIQ, meanwhile, uses a mouthguard-based head impact sensor system to gather data that can be used to explore any links between head knocks and concussion. The AFL’s general counsel, Andrew Dillon, said he hoped the projects would provide the league and concussion experts with valuable data. “The health and safety of our players is of paramount concern to the AFL and we are committed to further research in this area,” Dillon said. “The two studies will complement our continued action in this space over recent years including strengthening of the match-day protocols and amendments to the laws of the game to discourage high contact. “We are also using technology that is embedded in the ARC to provide another mechanism to identify potential concussive incidents that would not have otherwise been detected. We are encouraging all clubs to be involved in these studies.” Bio-Eye’s website claims it is a “low-cost method for the detection of sports concussion at clinics and on the sidelines”. The technology is also used to detect drug impairment in commercial truck drivers and to monitor cognitive decline, the website says.   Related: AFL considering proposal for landmark multimillion-dollar concussion trust for players   The AFL said the purpose of the study was “to determine whether the Bio-Eye application provides a valuable addition to the tests commonly used to diagnose and manage concussion”. The test, which uses a mobile phone to measure changes in eye movement, will be administered by club doctors or a nominated club representative, in addition to the existing tests clubs use to diagnose and manage concussion. The AFL has been researching the use of HitIQ for the past two seasons, but intends to expand the program via a phased rollout over the next three years, with the men’s competition to employ the technology this season and the AFLW from 2022. Data from either study will not be used to diagnose concussion this season. The moves come amid an increasingly loud conversation over the long-lasting effects of head trauma in collision sports. The AFL has made recent attempts to address the issue and revealed new guidelines around head trauma in January, with players to be sidelined for at least 12 days if they suffer a concussion. Concern over concussions led the league on Friday to reportedly consider a request from some coaches to use a substitute player to replace a concussed teammate this season. The league is also understood to be considering a proposal for a landmark multimillion-dollar concussion trust for players. The AFL says it is committed to minimising the impact of head injuries, and is currently in the final stages of interviewing for a new role – a concussion lead.\\n\",\n",

       "  'title': 'Government’s ‘pitiful’ boost to welfare payments does not go far enough, opposition says',\n",
       "  'full_article': \"Labor has argued the government’s $50-a-fortnight permanent boost to welfare payments “does not do enough to support Australians facing poverty and hardship”, but the bill is still set to pass parliament next week with the opposition’s support. In a report handed down on Friday, a government-controlled Senate committee backed its passage through parliament, while the Greens senator, Rachel Siewert, said the “pitiful” increase represented a “cruel and mean-spirited” cut from current Covid-boosted benefits. In additional comments added to the report, Labor MPs reiterated that the opposition, which had flagged possible amendments earlier this week, would not “stand in the way” of a “modest increase” to welfare payments.   Related: Covid supplement end will mean being pushed further into poverty, Australia's jobless warn   It follows the opposition’s social services spokeswoman, Linda Burney, saying on Tuesday her party was “going to support the increase”, and other comments last month suggesting the party may now go to the next election without a promise to further boost welfare payments. Under the bill, revealed by the Guardian last month, the government will increase the base rate of jobseeker, student and parenting payments by $50 a fortnight, or about $3.50 a day, from April. However, the coronavirus supplement – currently paid at $150 a fortnight – will be scrapped at the same time, meaning many see the change as a cut to the incomes of about 2 million people. In their additional comments to the Senate inquiry report, Labor senators argued its only options were to back the “modest” increase or see the jobseeker payment revert back to the pre-pandemic base rate of $40 a day. They claimed they were unable to propose or support a higher boost to payments because “amendments moved by the opposition or the crossbench to increase the rate of payments, or otherwise increase expenditure, would not be considered by the House of Representatives”. The opposition is yet to determine whether it will still seek to amend other aspects of the bill, but Labor senators backed concerns about proposed changes to the income-free area. Under that change, the amount jobseekers can earn from employment before their payment is cut will reduce from $300 to $150. Before the pandemic, the threshold was $106. In a dissenting report, Siewert argued for the jobseeker payment to be increased to the Henderson poverty line of $1,115 a fortnight, or $80 a day, the same rate supported by the Australian Unemployed Workers Union. The Greens senator argued that “by keeping income support payments below the poverty line, this government is wilfully choosing to condemn Australians to living in poverty”.   Related: Forcing jobseekers to move is not just bad policy – it does nothing to address the economy's real problems | Greg Jericho   “This is going to have a devastating impact on people across Australia,” she said. The committee chair, Liberal senator Wendy Askew, said the $50-a-fortnight boost was the “largest increase to working-age support payments in more than 35 years”. “The committee notes that the permanent increase represents a cost of an additional $9bn to the social security and welfare budget across forward estimates, accounting for around a third of all government spending,” she said. Askew said the committee believed the “taxpayer-funded increase” of $50 a fortnight “balances the need to ensure payments encourage and enable workforce participation with the need for the welfare system to be fiscally sustainable for future generations”. Since the mid-1990s, the jobseeker payment has only increased above inflation once, in 1994, and since the Howard era, it has fallen behind the age pension because it is pegged to inflation, rather than wages. The government said last month it would accompany the increase to payment with a hotline for employers to report jobseekers who do not take up work, and increased auditing of the quality of welfare recipients’ job applications. However, data provided to the committee suggests large numbers of jobseekers are already being penalised under the government’s welfare compliance regime. Since mutual obligations were reintroduced on 28 September, 616,862 jobseekers across jobactive, ParentsNext and Disability Employment Services had received a payment suspension. This means their payments were stopped temporarily and may have been delayed. In the Community Development Program, often known as remote work for the dole, the figure was 19,597. Guardian Australia has previously reported that many payment suspensions – which are partly automated – are applied in cases where welfare recipients were later found to have a “reasonable excuse” for missing their mutual obligation activity.\\n\",\n",

       "  'title': \"AFP didn't pass on documents detailing allegation against Christian Porter to NSW police\",\n",
       "  'full_article': \"The Australian federal police did not pass on documents containing an allegation of historical rape against the federal attorney general to New South Wales police, instead providing officers with a “summary”. Christian Porter has denied the allegation, which dates back to 1988 and was detailed in a bundle of documents sent anonymously to the prime minister and other senior MPs in late February. On Friday, NSW police lodged a detailed summary of its dealings with the woman who made the historical rape allegation against Porter, when responding to questions in a state budget estimates hearing. The state police force revealed that after Scott Morrison sent the documents to the AFP late last month it only provided NSW police with a “summary email”.   Related: Friend of Christian Porter's accuser says he has 'clear recollections' of 'relevant discussions' with Porter   “No attachments were provided,” NSW police said in its response to the estimates questions. Morrison, as well as Labor’s Penny Wong and Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young, were sent a letter from the alleged victim’s friends and a detailed statement written by the woman. NSW police, asked separately if the letter “by the complainant’s friends” was forwarded by the AFP, replied: “No.” The revelation comes after the NSW police commissioner, Mick Fuller, told the budget estimates hearing he would re-examine the case after a longtime friend of the alleged victim released a statement saying he recalled having “relevant discussions” about the case with the attorney general from as early as 1992. The Macquarie Bank managing director James Hooke on Friday said he had “clear recollections” of a series of “relevant discussions” with both the woman – his former girlfriend – and Porter. Hooke said he had known both Porter and his accuser for 30 years. Calling the woman “a very dear friend”, he recalled having “relevant discussions” with her from “mid-1988 until her death” in 2020 when she took her own life. Hooke said he was “aware of the fallibility of human memory, however unintentional”. He said he had “what I consider to be clear recollections of relevant discussions I had with Christian Porter from April 1992 in Perth and through the mid-1990s”. Asked by the Greens upper house MP David Shoebridge on Friday whether he would look to reopen the investigation in light of Hooke’s statement, Fuller said he was “more than happy to look into it”. “I know it’s a matter of Australian significance,” the police commissioner said. “I’m not going to say here on the record that we’re reopening the case but I’m more than happy to talk to deputy commissioner [David] Hudson and then through chain of command to ensure all the information has been properly assessed in terms of [deciding] that there’s not enough admissible evidence to go forward.” But while Fuller said he was “always open to new investigations” he cautioned that although it was not impossible to prosecute a sexual assault case without the alleged victim, “in reality it just wouldn’t happen”. “You just wouldn’t be able to run a historic sexual assault [case] without a victim and a signed statement,” he said. Although the AFP did not send through all the documents received by the prime minister, the Guardian understands the head of the AFP, Reece Kershaw, had spoken to both Fuller and Grant Stevens, the commissioner of South Australia police, in the days after the story became public. While the documents were given to the AFP it was not the investigating agency. NSW police said in its written answers on Friday that officers investigating the women’s allegation had been “aware that the victim was preparing a document however the victim declined to provide it to police until it was legally reviewed and finalised”. Then, on 2 July 2020, shortly after her death, investigators “received the 88-page dossier from … a friend of the victim”. NSW police have previously released a separate detailed statement about their involvement in the case after the allegation was referred to them in February 2020.   Related: It is not too late, prime minister, to seek the advice of the solicitor general | Justin Gleeson   The woman subsequently withdrew the complaint before taking her own life the following day. On Friday, NSW police revealed officers had been in contact with the woman several times in the period between February and June 2020, including eight emails, five text messages and 11 calls or attempted calls. But the Covid-19 pandemic meant police were not able to take a formal statement from the woman. On Friday, estimates heard an application by an officer to travel to South Australia where the woman lived had been rejected in March 2020. Fuller said the request had been rejected “on the basis of rules I put in place broadly on travel outside the state of NSW and I’m 99% sure that was a state government edict in terms of travel”. The document also revealed that police had discussed the option of having officers in SA take the woman’s formal statement, or allowing her to do it remotely. Ultimately, neither option was pursued. NSW police said that on 2 April 2020 “investigators had a conversation with the victim around the possibility of having the statement taken by a South Australian detective” but she had “expressed concerns over this course of action and it was not pursued”. “On 26 April 2020, a South Australian police detective spoke to victim and she no longer wanted to supply statement to them, preferring contact with [NSW] investigators,” police said. A phone or video statement was also discussed but “due to the complexities of the statement that was required and in the interests of the mental health and wellbeing of the victim it was deemed not to be an appropriate manner in which the statement should be obtained”, police said. • In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14.

       "  'title': 'The Adventures of Wolfboy review – charm and vulnerability in magical realism fable',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Broken into arch chapter headings that are introduced with intricate, stylised illustrations like something out of a book of fairytales for Gen Z and millennial misfits, this fey, magical realism fable is an interesting mixture of winning charm, smug knowingness and vulnerability. The screenwriter (Olivia Dufault), one of the young co-stars (Sophia Grace Gianni from Transparent) and the character she plays are all transgender, and the film is at its best when it is working through issues around dysphoria through the lens of allegory. That feeling of not being at ease in your own body is at the heart of this story about a 13-year-old named Paul (Jaeden Martell, heartbreakingly expressive even under a ton of prosthetics and fake hair) who has a condition that causes him to grow lustrous golden-red fur all over his body, including his face. Teased by peers at school, and already dealing with major abandonment issues after his mother ran off when he was little, he can’t even count on his well-meaning but clueless dad (Chris Messina) to do the right thing. One day Paul runs off to find his mother in that mythical land known as Pennsylvania. Along the way, he briefly becomes a freak show attraction at a carnival run by the menacing if mesmerising Mr Silk (John Turturro, going over the top, round the outside and up from underneath with an outrageously hammy performance); and then falls in love with a beautiful singer around his own age named Aristiana (Gianni), whose dreary mother insists on calling her by her dead name “Kevin”.    First time director Martin Krejci draws lovely performances from his cast, and the whole thing looks dreamy and splendid thanks to Andrew Droz Palermo’s cinematography – but the last act could have done with some serious workshopping to smooth out the motivational kinks and deflationary resolution. Still, it might be the kind of film a kid wrestling with their identity will treasure forever, flaws and all.  • The Adventures of Wolfboy is released on 15 March on digital platforms.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': \"Oppo Find X3 Pro review: Chinese smartphone champ can't beat Samsung\",\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Chinese smartphone brand Oppo is looking to cement itself as Samsung’s big challenger – filling the vacuum left by Huawei – but as nice as the Find X3 Pro is to look at, it is just not good value. Far from a household name in the UK, Oppo is part of BKK Electronics, which is one of the largest smartphone manufacturers in the world and operates brands OnePlus, Vivo and RealMe among others. The £1,099 device leads Oppo’s top Find X3 Android phone line for 2021 but it fails to justify its price, even with a very speedy recharging time of 31 minutes and a long battery life. On looks, the Find X3 Pro doesn’t reinvent the wheel in design – a metal and glass sandwich with a full-screen front – but the back glass is moulded to encase the camera lump on the back, which is unusual.    The back is one solid piece of glass the bends around the camera lump rather than it being encased in a separate piece of material. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian   But it does feel nice. The large 6.7in QHD+ OLED screen is bright, crisp and has a 120Hz refresh rate to make scrolling super smooth matching competitors. The curved sides and glass back make it one of the smoothest-feeling smartphones available, and its 74mm width and sub-200g weight make it easy to hold for a large phone. Specifications  Main screen: 6.7in QHD+ OLED (525ppi) 120Hz Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 RAM: 12GB of RAM Storage: 256GB Operating system: ColorOS 11.2 based on Android 11 Camera: Quad rear camera: 50MP wide, 50MP ultra-wide, 13MP telephoto, 3MP macro; 32MP front-facing camera Connectivity: 5G, dual nano sim, USB-C, wifi 6, NFC, Bluetooth 5.2 and location Water resistance: IP68 Dimensions: 163.6 x 74.0 x 8.3mm Weight: 193g  Top performance and super-fast charging    Oppo’s SuperVOOC 2.0 technology will charge the phone from 1% to 100% in just 31 minutes, hitting 60% in 14 minutes with the included USB-A power adaptor. It also has 30W wireless charging and reverse wireless charging. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian   The Find X3 Pro has the latest top processor available for Android devices, the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. It performs very well indeed – the interface is snappy, apps are responsive and games fly. It also has very good battery life. With the screen set to its maximum QHD+ resolution and 120Hz frame rate, the phone lasts about 49 hours with the screen used for about 5.5 hours in various apps, meaning 7am on day one until 7am on day three. That includes two hours on 5G, the rest on wifi, an hour of Disney+ and about 20 photos shot. Sustainability Oppo rates the battery for at least 800 full charge cycles using its 65W SuperVOOC 2.0 system while maintaining at least 80% of its original capacity. Oppo has partnered with the repair firm iSmash for its product servicing in the UK. Oppo declined to say whether the battery was replaceable. The company does not operate a trade-in or recycling scheme in the UK. It declined to comment on the use of recycled materials or the publishing of environmental impact assessments.   Related: How we are changing the way we rate sustainability of consumer electronics   ColorOS 11.2    ColorOS is a fast and well-optimised version of Android, but its default colour scheme and icon design make it look a little dated compared to some competitors. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian   ColorOS 11.2 is Oppo’s heavily customised Android version, here based on Android 11. While it works more or less the same as Android versions from Google, OnePlus or Samsung, it looks a bit basic in its default colour scheme and design. If square icons and pastel green colour scheme aren’t for you, the interface is highly customisable either with dedicated themes or just manual tweaks. The speed of animations can be changed as well as lots of gestures and navigation options. There’s a “pull-out tray” for making using two apps on the screen a bit easier, plus ways to quickly launch apps using the in-screen fingerprint reader as a virtual joystick. Some oddities include the fact most notification icons do not appear in the status bar by default, and must be turned on per app and per notification type (such as for messages but not alerts). You have to tap on notifications to expand them, rather than pulling down on them. The gesture to quickly launch the camera while the phone is locked is a double-press of one of the volume buttons, which is common in China, but not in Europe or the US where it is usually a double-press of the power button. The phone also attempts to get you to sign up for an account with a firm called HeyTap, but doesn’t explain why, who HeyTap is or the function it provides (it’s a cloud services firm) or why you should trust it with your data. Oppo will only commit to supporting the Find X3 Pro with at least two years of software and security updates, including two new Android version updates, from release, which is simply not good enough. No one should be using devices that are no longer updated to keep their data safe. When most good competitors offer at least three years of updates, with Samsung offering four years and Apple at least five years for similar or lower-cost devices, two years is poor. It is a shame as ColorOS is a fast and well-optimised version of Android with little in the way of unwanted or duplicate apps. Camera    The camera app is fairly simple to use for point and shoot, but also has more advanced shooting options including a solid ‘Pro’ mode, 10-bit colour and portrait mode. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian   On the back of the phone are four cameras, including a 50MP main, 50MP ultra-wide, 13MP 2x telephoto and a 3MP “microlens”, which is a zoomed-in macro lens a bit like a microscope. The main and ultrawide 50MP cameras both have exactly the same image sensor, which is unusual, but means that you get very similar images shot by both cameras just with a different field of view. In good light, images are crisp, well balanced for colour and with good dynamic range. Low light performance is also solid, while video capture is pretty good too with interesting “film modes”, including at up to 8K at 30 frames a second, HDR and Log capture if you really want to try and shoot a bit more than a home movie. All these are things you should expect from a good main camera, but are far less common on an ultra-wide angle camera. The telephoto camera offers 2x optical or 5x hybrid. When used in good light it can shoot good photos at 2x with plenty of detail. The hybrid 5x zoom is decent, but is clearly digitally expanded when compared with competitors with real 5x optical zoom cameras. The Oppo often switches to a digital zoom on the main camera rather than use the 2x optical camera too, causing the viewfinder to jump as it switches cameras.    The macro camera has a little LED ring light around the lens that helps illuminate the subject at the super-close distances. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian   The macro camera is surprisingly fun allowing you take pictures of detail such as the individual fibres of a fabric that you can’t see with the naked eye. You have to place the phone practically resting on top of your subject, but with a bit of patience you can produce some interesting almost microscopic images. Not something I’d use much, but fun nonetheless. The 32-megapixel selfie camera can produce some good, highly detailed shots, and handles dim indoor lighting admirably. Overall, the camera on the Find X3 Pro is very good, but the lack of a really good zoom camera hurts it. Similarly priced competitors offer significantly better zooms of up to 10x optical. Observations    The in-screen optical fingerprint sensor is one of the fastest available, matching that from OnePlus and the Galaxy S21 series for speed and accuracy. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian    The phone’s haptic vibrations are generally nice and sharp, but some alerts can be a bit short and easy to miss, even with it turned up to maximum. Call quality and 5G performance on EE was excellent. The screen and back are covered in the older Gorilla Glass 5, not the latest significantly more shatter-resistant Gorilla Glass Victus  Price The Oppo Find X3 Pro will cost £1,099 in black or blue, available from 14 April. For comparison, the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra has an RRP of £1,149, the Galaxy S21+ costs £819, the OnePlus 8 Pro costs £799 and the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max costs £1,099. Verdict The Oppo Find X3 Pro is a really nice-feeling, high-performing smartphone that costs too much for what it offers and has guaranteed software support for only two years. The screen is great, the build is top-notch, it has the most powerful processor you can get in an Android phone, long battery life and incredibly fast charging. The camera is good too, but lack of a really good zoom camera hurts it when the phone costs £1,099. Samsung’s Galaxy S21 Ultra, with an RRP of just £50 more, has fantastic main and ultra-wide cameras plus a market-leading 5x and 10x optical zoom camera system and will be supported for four years. Apple’s iPhone 12 Pro Max costs £1,099 and will see in excess of five years of support. Two years of software support is simply not good enough, losing it a star on sustainability grounds.  Pros: great screen, top performance, long battery life, very fast charging, smooth build, sub-200g weight, good camera, water resistance, fast in-screen fingerprint scanner. Cons: lack of extended optical zoom for the camera, only two years of software support guaranteed, expensive.     The stereo speakers, which include the top handset speaker shown here, are pretty good for impromptu movie watching.

       "  'title': 'The fight for the Galápagos: race to expand reserve as fishing fleets circle ',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Strolling along a beach dotted with sea lion pups and their mothers barking at one another, utterly unconcerned by your presence, is a singularly magical experience. On the trail leading to the shore on tiny Seymour Island, noisily courting blue-footed boobies and frigate birds are equally unruffled by the presence of humans. Getting up close to the natural world without disturbing it seems as refreshingly easy on the Galápagos Islands today as when Charles Darwin visited on HMS Beagle in 1835. Isolated from the mainland, the archipelago’s unique endemic species – from giant tortoises to finches – helped Darwin set out his theory of evolution in On the Origin of Species.   Related: Chinese fishing armada plundered waters around Galápagos, data shows   One of the reasons the islands are such a hotbed of life is that the shallower, nutrient-rich waters around the volcanic atolls are fed by a confluence of cold and warm currents. This provides a refuge for an array of migratory ocean-going species, from scalloped hammerhead sharks to leatherback turtles. But it’s also why industrial foreign fishing fleets lurk at the edge of the Ecuadorian archipelago’s territorial waters. Nearly 250 vessels – 243 of them Chinese flagged, including vast fishing boats and refrigerated container ships – have logged an astounding 73,000 hours of fishing a month and pulled up thousands of tonnes of squid and fish. Ecuadorian tuna boats are there, too: they circle the Galápagos marine reserve – an area of 133,000 sq km (51,000 sq miles) – and float hundreds of fish aggregation devices, or FADs. Conservationists have been sounding the alarm, saying that unprecedented pressure from overfishing, and excessive bycatch of sharks and other species, now threaten marine life in the world-renowned archipelago.    Walter Borbor, a small-scale fisherman, holds his catch of scorpion fish, or brujo. He must make longer fishing trips for smaller catches as he competes with huge factory ships near the Galápagos marine reserve. Photograph: Dan Collyns   Their concerns have led to a new proposal: an expansion of the Galápagos marine reserve area, wrapping another swathe of protected ocean from the north, east and south around it like a scarf. Speaking to the Guardian, Ecuador’s president, Lenín Moreno, said the proposal was based on his “government’s strong commitment to conservation, the protection of the environment and, in particular, the Galápagos Islands”. It was the same commitment he had set out at the COP25 UN climate change conference in 2019, he said. Many conservation organisations are thrilled by the idea. “It is the first-ever smart proposal which benefits fishermen, biodiversity and reduces the impact of climate change,” said Matt Rand, director of the Pew Bertarelli Ocean Legacy project.  Map of Galápagos Islands’ marine reserve zones The Galápagos Islands’ marine reserve zones  But not everyone agrees. The plan – which Moreno has notably not yet approved – would extend the marine reserve to 445,953 sq km, more than three times the size of the existing protected area. It would also shut out Ecuador’s larger tuna fishing boats from three-quarters of the archipelago’s exclusive economic zone, extending for 200 nautical miles around the existing reserve. An exception would be made in the zone’s south-western quarter, which would be set aside for “responsible fishing”. Luigi Benincasa, executive director of Atunec, Ecuador’s tuna fishing association, said the plan amounted to punishing local fishermen. “We must understand that a third of our catch, which we get in an exclusively Ecuadorian fishing zone, we won’t have tomorrow,” he said. “How is that beneficial [for us]?”    A Galápagos penguin – the only penguin found in the tropics and the endemic to the islands Photograph: Jorge de la Quintana   Fishing on the western side of the archipelago, which is about 620 miles (1,000km) from continental Ecuador, would have an impact on profits at a time of economic hardship, said Benincasa. In the Pacific port of Manta, the tuna industry provides work for up to 200,000 people, he said. The tuna sector makes up the vast majority of the country’s $1.6bn (£1.2bn) fishing industry. “We would have to seek fishing grounds much further away with much greater fuel consumption, as well as having to compete with the international fleets,” Benincasa added. Ecuador has the largest and most productive tuna fleet in the eastern Pacific region, and the second-largest in the world, with more than 100 purse-seine net tuna fishing boats and nearly as many long-liners. When it was created in 1998, the Galápagos marine reserve was the second largest in the world. Now it is number 33, outstripped in size and ambition by other South American nations such as Chile, which created the 740,000 sq km Rapa Nui marine reserve around Easter Island and has promised to protect more than 40% of its total marine territory. Meanwhile, Ecuador’s tuna fishing fleet and the size of its catch have since more than doubled in size, says Eliecer Cruz, leader of Más Galápagos, a local initiative to expand the reserve. Research shows fishing productivity has increased by 104% in the islands’ exclusive economic zone this century. Whale sharks, great hammerhead sharks as well as leatherback turtles and waved albatross, have all become listed as critically endangered in the IUCN red list since 1998 as industrial-scale fishing has increased. They are among 14 marine migratory species found in the archipelago’s waters – including Galápagos fur seals and sea lions – whose conservation status has worsened in the past two decades. (The range of the waved albatross extends to southern Chile but it only nests on the island of Española.) But even though only small-scale fishing is allowed in the marine reserve, larger vessels get around the ban by luring the fish outside the protected zone using FADs. Known locally as plantados, they are used to target tuna, but sweep up other pelagic fish such as shark, sailfish and marlin, and attract sea lions, dolphins and turtles before drifting out of the marine park. “The plantados keep on arriving [inside the reserve],” said Cruz. “The bigger fishing boats of between 1,200 to 2,000 tonnes can cast 500 of them.” Walter Borbor, an artisanal fisherman from Santa Cruz island who line-fishes for tuna, has come across many of the floating fish traps, which are basically wooden rafts with GPS trackers attached and nets hanging down for up to 100 metres.    Galápagos land iguana, one of three species of the lizard on the archipelago. Photograph: Jorge de la Quintana   “The big boats throw them outside the reserve knowing there’s an infinity of currents that will carry them through and out again with a big shoal of smaller fish, which attract the bigger fish,” Borbor shouted over the noise of the outboard engine on his eight-metre fibreglass boat. “We’ve collected at least 30 plantados. We reuse the nets to make hammocks and chicken coops,” he said. Pulling up a thrashing yellowfin tuna, the diminutive fisherman said he must make increasingly longer fishing trips for a smaller catch. “Surrounding the islands there are many industrial boats that prevent the pelagic fish from coming in – they come here to spawn and to eat,” Borbor said. “The spillover effect shows just how successful the marine reserve has been,” said Norman Wray, president of the Galápagos governing council. “But now we need to expand it.” Robust fish populations have attracted too much pressure, Wray said, not just from the national fleet but from foreign vessels, which fish intensively on the edge of the exclusion zone. Moreno must decide whether to commit to the reserve’s expansion by signing a decree before he leaves office on 24 May. “An eventual increase in conservation measures in the Galápagos marine reserve would overlap with important areas of activity for the fishing sector, including artisanal fishing, with a possible negative impact for the national economy,” the president said when asked if he planned to expand the reserve. “For that reason, any analysis should be comprehensive, including all the environmental and socioeconomic aspects.” If Moreno does not sign the proposal into law, it could face a longer and more convoluted route, as a parliamentary committee on biodiversity and natural resources would have to decide whether it should be debated and voted on in the national assembly. Juan Cárdenas, an assembly member on the committee, said he backed the expansion proposal because of the islands’ world heritage status. “I understand the position of the fishermen but they are not the interests of our nation,” he said. However, the powerful fishing industry is expected to exert its influence on Moreno and on whoever becomes the country’s next leader. Benincasa, the tuna industry representative, argued that as a developing country Ecuador could not afford to give away more of its ocean to conservation. “We shouldn’t be so naive,” he said. Ecuador has signed up to the Global Ocean Alliance in support of the UK-led 30 by 30 initiative, an international commitment to protect at least 30% of the global ocean in protected marine areas by 2030. So far about 13% of Ecuador’s waters are safeguarded. Conservationists hope further international support for the proposal to expand the Galápagos marine reserve could sway Moreno’s decision. “It would be an incredible legacy to leave,” said Cruz.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': \"What happens if we're not interested in going to the shops when they reopen? | Andy Beckett\",\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Under capitalism, shops are one of the places where our society is supposed to feel most alive. Window displays beckon. Products are piled high. Stock changes constantly. Desires are created and never quite satisfied. For most of the past year, shops in Britain – one of the economies most driven by consumerism – have not been like that at all. Even the grandest London department stores were often eerie places during the few months they were open last summer and autumn: customers sparse, staff trying to keep busy, the same goods on the shelves for much longer than normal. In its most physical form, British consumerism has slowed down and frequently ground to a halt. Online shopping seems to have been in the opposite state: rocketing sales, rushes for supermarket delivery slots. In many residential areas, delivery vans have been virtually the only traffic – for much of the day the only activity on the streets at all. The life of a neighbourhood reduced to the highly visible consumption habits of its inhabitants: it’s a vision of modern Britain to make the most doctrinaire capitalists and Marxists feel vindicated. Meanwhile inside our homes, as lockdown efforts to self-improve have dwindled, browsing and buying on screens have become many people’s default leisure activity, even more than before Covid. Hallways have filled up with parcels, just arrived or about to be returned. The home as stockroom: another example of consumerism penetrating deeper into our lives. Yet in other ways online shopping has slowed over the past year as well. In some areas badly hit by coronavirus, such as London and the West Midlands, postal deliveries have often been sluggish and erratic, as the increased number of parcels, social distancing in sorting offices and staff infections hamper Royal Mail. And since January, Brexit has added further obstructions: shipping delays and refusals, and unpredictable, often substantial, import charges for goods from the EU. The almost omnipotent feeling that online shopping used to give Britons with money, or the means to borrow it – that most of Europe was our shopping mall – has gone. As more and more people wake up to this, the consequences for the government may be awkward. More expensive and more bureaucratic shopping, with less choice, was not what leavers voted for. Last year, during the first lockdown, some people celebrated what they saw as the retreat of consumerism in favour of less individualistic and environmentally damaging pastimes. Some thought this retreat would be lasting. Yet instead, British consumerism is in a contradictory state: dramatically less visible in our town and city centres, but more important than ever in many of our heads. In a time of terrible loss, acquiring more possessions can be a small way of pushing back against the emptiness. The escape through consumption that capitalism has always promised has become something bigger, at least for some: a rare source of pleasure in lockdown, even a way of feeling more alive again. A lot of the people currently standing in cold, socially distanced queues for coffee, something they could make at home, are really trying to buy a shot of pre-Covid normality. A month from now, “non-essential” shops will reopen in England, according to Boris Johnson’s possibly reckless timetable. The government, optimistic economists such as the Bank of England’s Andy Haldane, and many of the 10% of English employees who work or are on furlough in retail, are all hoping that money not spent during lockdown will start to be spent in shops on 12 April, and will help revive the economy as a whole. In the longer term, shops may lose their central retail role – John Lewis has just announced plans to shut stores – but this spring a lot of emotions are going to be invested in them. If customers stay away after the novelty of reopening wears off, we’ll know that the psychological recovery from the virus has barely begun. Until 12 April, most shops will remain in a state of suspended animation. In the nonessential ones at my local shopping centre in north London, the lights are still on in display cabinets, winter sale stickers are still on windows, and most of the clothes rails are still full, but dust is gathering. A shirt I was thinking of buying before the current lockdown hangs tantalisingly out of reach. During the pandemic this frozen landscape, and the way it thwarts our desires, has become so familiar you can forget how strange and unprecedented it is. It’s as if the quiet, rule-bound Sunday England that existed before the trading laws were liberalised a quarter of a century ago has returned and taken over the rest of the week as well. If you’re uneasy about consumerism, all these closed shops can be calming, even inspiring – a glimpse of a society less dominated by commerce. But if you like the bustle and freedom of towns and cities, the sight of these once busy, semi-communal spaces now deserted and out of bounds can be unsettling – a possible future for much of Britain, as our lives shift increasingly from physical to digital space. And even our online shopping economy has vulnerabilities. Last May, the respected retail analyst Richard Hyman wrote on his blog: “Retail entered this [coronavirus] crisis in bad shape. The industry was bloated with too many stores, too many websites …” After the pandemic, he continued, “We will have a materially smaller non-food sector.” Behind that jargon lurk thousands of redundancies and abandoned premises. The great British shopping crisis is not over yet.  Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnist \\n',\n",

       "  'full_article': 'The sad, shifty and inglorious business of government informants working inside radical protest groups is something that usually takes years to come out – if at all – because nobody wants to talk about it. Governments don’t want to gloat because it might mean admitting they knew all about certain events or attacks in advance but did nothing because they wanted to keep their asset in place to forestall some bigger situation. And the protest groups are angry and ashamed at the infiltration. And something desolate attaches to the long-term snitches themselves, who look horribly dysfunctional, like bigamists revealed to have a second wife and family. Sam Pollard’s documentary MLK/FBI touched briefly on the supposedly loyal insiders within Martin Luther King’s organisation who were secretly reporting to J Edgar Hoover – a subject so painful that it can still hardly be discussed.   Related: Sundance 2021: which films might break out this year?   Now there is this fiercely watchable and passionately performed drama from the director Shaka King, with barnstorming performances from Lakeith Stanfield and Daniel Kaluuya – about the Chicago Black Panther leader Fred Hampton who in 1969, at the age of 21, was cold-bloodedly shot at home during a raid by the FBI. The Bureau had been given inside information about the layout of his apartment by their snitch: Hampton’s trusted security chief William O’Neal, a former petty criminal who had been arrested and “turned” by the FBI man Roy Mitchell four years previously, and then instructed to rise up through the Black Panther ranks. O’Neal had also drugged Hampton’s drink so that he would be asleep or bleary during the raid and unable to escape.O’Neal might be nothing more than a footnote, but this drama shrewdly and fascinatingly elevates him to equal status with Hampton – a diptych of tragic irony, the Judas to Hampton’s messiah, a guy who had come up from the same streets as Hampton and might, if things had been different, had the same vocation. Daniel Kaluuya is Hampton himself, a little bulked up, and superbly conveying the muscular force of his charisma, his rhetoric and his instinctive leadership, and he brilliantly turns on the death-ray of Hampton’s basilisk stare. And Stanfield gives us a career-best performance as poor William O’Neal, wonderfully cast as the ordinary guy who gets in over his head: Stanfield’s gentle face, often breaking into a slippery but charming smile, is enough to break your heart. Dominique Fishback is surely in line for a best supporting actress Oscar, with her sensitive, sympathetic performance as Fred’s partner Deborah Johnson. Jesse Plemons is Roy Mitchell, the Bureau man “running” O’Neal and Martin Sheen has a returning cameo in heavy facial prosthetic as the creepy J Edgar himself.     But what a high-octane charge of excitement Kaluuya and Stanfield bring to the screen simply by showing up. There is something mesmeric about the way Hampton, with an almost Napoleonic confidence, faces everyone down with his searching gaze, and yet is boyishly shy with Deborah, and Fishback’s contribution is so important for giving the audience access to the drama. As for Stanfield, he makes O’Neal seem sympathetic or even romantic in his patently doomed career of treason: visibly thrilled to be taken out by Mitchell for a lavish steak-house lunch on the Bureau’s tab or invited to Mitchell’s house and allowed to drink his scotch; never in denial exactly, in fact excruciatingly aware of the danger, but never facing up to what he is doing. Yet the inevitable, terrible moment comes during a meal at Hampton’s house – the last supper.Somehow, the Judas figure seems as important, almost more important than the Messiah: I found myself thinking of the Borges story, Three Versions Of Judas, in which Judas’s destiny and significance is terrifyingly revealed to be much greater than anyone imagined. Like many biopics, this ends with a postscript – three or four stark sentences about the historical facts. It’s a cliche, but Shaka King does something very unexpected with it: he begins with Lakeith Stanfield playing the older O’Neal giving a TV interview in 1990 about his life, and ends with the real O’Neal saying the same words – but there is a vicious sting in the tail. It’s a powerful tale of human frailty.

       "  'title': 'Friday briefing: Coal hold – minister pauses Cumbria mine',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Top story: ‘Better late than never’ A controversial coalmine planned for Cumbria appears to have been put on hold with the local government secretary, Robert Jenrick, taking responsibility for the scheme away from the local authority and putting it to a public inquiry. Ministers have previously been criticised for not blocking the coalmine, particularly given that the UK is hosting Cop26, the UN climate summit, in November. A few weeks ago one of the country’s most eminent environmental scientists, Sir Robert Watson, said it was “absolutely ridiculous” the government was refusing to act. A notice from Jenrick’s ministry to Cumbria county council said he was “calling in” the planning application, citing “further developments” since he last considered the case including a report from the independent Committee on Climate Change, which advises the government on emissions targets. The council approved the mine, called Woodhouse Colliery, in October, and Jenrick refused to intervene at the time. Alok Sharma, the former business secretary put in charge of organising Cop26, was said to be furious at the decision to let it proceed. Greenpeace has hailed it as “fantastic news and definitely better late than never”. Friends of the Earth added it was a “startling, but very welcome U-turn”, and urged the government to refuse permission for the project. * * * ‘Bright and beautiful’ – Relatives of Sarah Everard have spoken of their pain after police searching for the missing 33-year-old said they had found human remains. The marketing executive’s family paid tribute to the “bright and beautiful” woman on Thursday and appealed for anyone with information about her disappearance to come forward to authorities. They described her as a “wonderful daughter and sister”, adding: “She was kind and thoughtful, caring and dependable. She always put others first and had the most amazing sense of humour.”    Sarah Everard. Photograph: Metropolitan police/AFP/Getty Images   They added: “She was strong and principled and a shining example to us all. We are very proud of her and she brought so much joy to our lives. We would like to thank our friends and family for all their support during this awful time and we would especially like to thank Sarah’s friends who are working tirelessly to help. We are so grateful to the police and would like to thank them for all they are doing. We are now pleading for additional help from the public. Please come forward and speak to the police if you have any information. No piece of information is too insignificant. Thank you.” Meanwhile Reclaim These Streets, which wants to hold a vigil on Saturday evening close to where Everard disappeared, has said it was told by police that it would be unlawful. The Met said in a statement last night that it understood “the public’s strength of feeling … We remain in discussion with the organisers about this event in light of the current Covid regulations.” The Labour MP Harriet Harman said she had written to the Met to back the event, adding: “Parliament has not specifically acted to constrain the right to demonstrate, so long as social distancing is observed this vigil will be perfectly lawful.” * * * Met faces inquiry over Everard suspect – The Metropolitan police is to face an inquiry into whether it properly investigated a claim of indecent exposure involving the suspect in the alleged murder of Sarah Everard. PC Wayne Couzens has been arrested on suspicion of the kidnap and murder of Everard. He has also been arrested on suspicion of an indecent exposure involving another woman, and this is the incident that will be investigated by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC). The alleged indecent exposure happened on 28 February at a fast food restaurant in south London. Everard disappeared after leaving a friend’s house in the south of the capital at about 9pm on 3 March to walk home. * * * Arts rescue fund slow to pay out – A government fund established to prop up the arts and heritage sectors during the coronavirus pandemic has handed over little more than half of the money it has allocated, Whitehall’s spending watchdog has discovered. The National Audit Office said the culture recovery fund had budgeted for £830m in grants and loans funding so far, but only £495m had been paid out. MPs have responded angrily to the findings, urging the government to hand over the cash while “there are still organisations left to support”. London has received 31% of total revenue grant funding, followed by the north-west and the south-east of England, which each received 12%, auditors said. * * * ‘Pass the domestic abuse bill’ – Boris Johnson has come under concerted pressure to take action to tackle male violence and misogyny and make the UK safer for women. During the annual International Women’s Day debate in the House of Commons dozens of female MPs have told moving and angry stories of harassment. The Labour MP Jess Phillips read out the names of 118 women killed by men since last year’s debate.     The Lib Dems’ Wendy Chamberlain urged the government to make misogyny a hate crime. “Pass the domestic abuse bill – it’s been in the offing for four years,” she said. There is cross-party pressure to use the crime and sentencing bill to take tougher action on crimes against women, when the wide-ranging legislation returns to the House of Commons next week. The government is yet to publish a long-promised strategy on tackling violence against women and girls. The prime minister’s spokesperson said on Thursday that ministers hoped to do so by the end of the year. * * * ‘No place for us to go’ – Residents in the Yemeni province of Marib are bracing for what could be the worst mass displacement of the war as a Houthi rebel offensive intensifies, leaving more than 2 million people trapped including many displaced by the conflict from elsewhere. The frontline is getting closer to Marib city, an oil-rich desert town 75 miles (120km) east of the capital, Sana’a, that was home to approximately 400,000 people before the war. Its population has swollen to about 2.7 million because of people fleeing fighting elsewhere in the country.    Yemeni soldiers ride on the back of a patrol truck. Photograph: Ali Owidha/Reuters   There are 138 poorly serviced displacement camps in the area – five have been abandoned and their residents relocated since February, according to the Marib Girls Foundation. Hamas al-Muslimi, a student who has lived in Marib for several years, said: “The fighting is just a few kilometres away now … but there is no other place for us to go.” Joe Biden is pushing for the resumption of UN-sponsored talks to end the conflict. Marib is the Yemeni government’s only northern stronghold: its fall would greatly weaken their negotiating position and derail diplomatic efforts to end the war. * * * World may be at ‘peak twin’ – Twin births may be more common today than at any time in history, according to the first comprehensive global survey in the field. Researchers looked at more than 100 countries and found for every 42 people born, one is a twin, which adds up to 1.6 million children a year. The global twin birthrate has risen by one-third, on average, over the past 40 years. But the world may have reached “peak twin”, the authors say, as the most recent data suggest some countries have begun to see rates plateau or fall. While the birthrate for identical twins – created when a single fertilised egg splits – has barely changed, researchers found an increase in naturally conceived, non-identical twins, as well as twins born as a result of medically assisted reproduction. Most now are born as a result of fertility treatments.

The Sun’s splash is “Sarah suspect linked to sex offence … did cops fail to act?” while the Telegraph has “Everard suspect ‘exposed himself in restaurant’”. Its picture lead is “Duke: we are very much not a racist family”, the duke in question being Prince William.

       "  'title': 'Britain advises its citizens to flee Myanmar amid fears of mounting violence  ',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'The British government has urged its citizens to flee Myanmar after one of the bloodiest days since February’s coup left at least 12 people dead amid an increasingly violent crackdown by the military regime. The UK Foreign Office released advice on Friday for British nationals to leave the troubled south-east Asian country if they could, warning that “political tension and unrest are widespread since the military takeover and levels of violence are rising”. Weeks of clashes between security forces and pro-democracy activists angry at the ousting of an elected government have plunged the country into chaos. Activists called for strikes and civil disobedience campaigns that have paralysed swathes of the economy to continue on Friday despite the brutal crackdown.    Motorcycle riders protest in Mandalay for an end to the military junta. Photograph: SH/Penta Press/REX/Shutterstock   Tensions in the country were also heightened after the civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who has been detained since 1 February, was accused by the military of taking bribes worth $1.3m in cash and gold. The release of Aung San Suu Kyi, who has been held on the relatively minor charge of possessing illegal walkie-talkies, has been one of the protesters’ main demands. But although her lawyer dismissed the accusations that she took payments from the chief minister of Yangon as a “joke”, they would carry a longer prison sentence and represent an escalation of the regime’s attempts to silence her. Amid the deteriorating situation in the country, a leading United Nations expert said the military has likely committed “crimes against humanity” in its attempt to stay in power.     Thomas Andrews, the UN’s special rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar, told the UN’s human rights council in Geneva the crimes likely included “acts of murder, enforced disappearance, persecution, torture” carried out with “the knowledge of senior leadership”, including junta leader Min Aung Hlaing. While stressing that such offences can only be determined in a court of law, he said there was clear evidence that the junta’s crimes were “widespread” and part of a “coordinated campaign”. Andrews, an American who served as a state lawmaker in Maine, lamented the “horrible truth” that every time he issues a report on the situation, “the number of murders and arbitrary detentions in Myanmar becomes outdated”. He said the count of arbitrary detentions since the coup had topped 2,000 as of Wednesday night and the deaths attributed to the security forces was rising. “As of this moment, credible reports indicate that Myanmar security forces had murdered at least 70 people,” he said. Diplomatic pressure has been building on the generals, who have tried to quell daily protests by force. But Andrews said that a UN security council statement on Wednesday expressing concern at the situation in Myanmar was “welcome, but ... wholly insufficient”. It had been drafted by Britain but was watered down after interventions by Russia and China.    A funeral is held for Chit Min Thu, 25, who was killed in clashes on Thursday in Yangon, Myanmar. Photograph: Hkun Lat/Getty Images   At least eight people were killed on Thursday in Myaing, a town in the central Magway region, according to local press reports and posts on social media. There were also fatalities in Yangon, Mandalay, Bago and Taungoo. “Six men were shot dead while eight people were wounded – with one man in a critical condition,” a rescue worker in Myaing told Agence-France Presse. A witness said five of them were shot in the head. In Bago, a city north-east of Yangon, Zaw Zaw Aung, 33, who is deaf, was shot in the head, his father Myint Lwin said. “As a father, I am deeply sad for his death,” he said. A rescue worker told AFP a 30-year-old man was killed in Mandalay, Myanmar‘s second largest city and another two people were injured. “We couldn’t pick up his dead body because rescue teams are being targeted these days as well,” he said. There was also a fatality in Yangon’s North Dagon, where Chit Min Thu, 25, died after being shot in the head. “I recently learnt that his wife is two months pregnant,” his mother Hnin Malar Aung told AFP. “No one will be in peace until this situation ends. They were so cruel with my son. I never expected my son would be shot in the head ... I’m worried about all the unarmed youth, they will be in trouble.” Agence France-Presse, Reuters and Associated Press contributed to this report.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': \" Dan O'Brien: ‘Write in terror. Your characters should fear for their lives’\",\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Writers are fond of advising: “Write as if you are dying.” The threat of death is meant to clarify. This approach sounds well and good, but I’m here to tell you that it’s difficult to do; I mean, writing this way isn’t exactly fun. It’s joyful, it’s sorrowful. What did Rilke say? “Every angel is terrifying.” Nobody truly wants to write a play for an audience of the living when one is possibly not going to be around to watch it with them. I want to hear your applause. I want to sit on the aisle in the back row or up in the balcony (or “the gods”, as they used to say) and watch my play “work” – move you and wake you to the present moment of my story, the way my story as I wrote it woke me to the present moment of my life. Writers advise you to write this way, with the skull upon your desk, if you will, because you may, in such a state, through such a frame of mind, write with your eyes open. My friend Paul Watson, a recently retired war reporter, has been telling me for years now some version of how “it bugs me to the core that people don’t notice how quickly we die. Whether we’re driving home from work, or sunbathing on a beach in Phuket, and a wave comes in and just keeps on coming …” Or this: a friend of a friend was honeymooning not long ago. It was the day after the wedding and he was driving with his new wife when a spider crawled on to his shoulder, causing him to swerve, minutely, into an oncoming bus. The bride somehow survived. One must write while awake to life, to death, in a state of barely controlled terror, but more importantly, one’s characters should be terrified, too. They should fear for their lives.    Stephen Rea as Vanya in a version by Frank McGuinness at the Tricycle theatre, London, in 1995. Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian   But life, like art, is subjective. I’m paraphrasing Chekhov when he said something like: “I want to write plays where people are sharing a civilised meal, and one person’s life is coming together while another’s is falling apart.”  “The graceful adventure of conversation” is how I remember Borges – definitely not a playwright – putting it. Terror lies in the eye of the beholder, so one must frighten oneself first, must “write toward danger”, as [the US playwright] Romulus Linney once declared, in a lecture that I happened to witness, while an epic thunderstorm raged outside the lecture hall’s windows. Because I have written mainly dramas, and documentary and memoir plays, I may sound as if I’m shilling for more of the same. But the best comedy is dangerous (I have this on authority from my professionally comedic wife) as it satirises the powerful and assails shibboleths. There’s a healing honesty in comedy, too, in telling the truth about our vulnerabilities and fears and shames. The playwright Joe Orton was rehearsing the premiere of his seminal farce Loot, in which the titular stolen goods have been stashed inside a casket that is supposed to contain a character’s dead mother; the corpse is stuffed, instead, in a cupboard. Hijinks ensue, her body’s tossed around on stage, undressed, done up as a dressmaker’s dummy. At some point, her glass eye pops loose and rolls around – in and out of hands and, if I recall, a mouth. But the play wasn’t working in rehearsal: it just wasn’t funny. So one morning Orton brought in his dead mother’s dentures and asked a cast member to hold out his hand. He placed the well-worn prosthetic teeth in the centre of the actor’s sweaty palm: “These are my dead mother’s teeth,” and the actor reacted with a queasy mixture of revulsion and anger. “That’s what’s missing from your performance,” Orton said. And by all accounts the play got better.    Risk of corpsing? Sinead Matthews, Ian Redford and Sam Frenchum with Anah Ruddin in the coffin in Loot by Joe Orton at Park theatre, London, in 2017. Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian   I have wanted to wake up for a long time. Many of my plays begin with the command, figuratively and in one instance literally – “Wake up!” It’s a cinematic commonplace: all those bedside alarms, our protagonists waking to the stories that will change their lives for ever. But my urge to see and say things as they are was counterbalanced by my fear of life, by the muddle of my anxiety and ego. My repression. I simultaneously hid and revealed myself in my plays. I gravitated at first toward historical epics, where time in its grandest sense could be stage-managed, and where the casts were large and the ideas larger. My props – I’m serious – propagated out of control. I camouflaged myself in clutter. I was drawn to ghost stories, too: for the ready metaphor of child abuse, or so I discovered with distance (and therapy), but also because my true self was present like a ghost in my plays. I used to think that all good plays were haunted, or they were hauntings at least in terms of their performance. When I was new to New York City I wanted to start a theatre company called the Dead Theatre. Partly this was a joke, as in, OK, fine, the theatre’s dead; it’s been dead a while yet we’re a theatre and here we are. But also: Let’s do what the dead do well, then. Haunt. Let’s step out of the wings of the past, out of the individual and the cultural unconscious, and remind ourselves and our audience of something unsettling and unsettled that needs to be confronted and, if possible, set right. So I liked forgotten stories. Or, better yet, unknowable stories that alluded to unspeakable truths. But I was still, myself, half-hidden. Or I was creatively somnambulistic.

       "  'title': 'Pollutionwatch: how much Sahara desert dust do we breathe?',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Saharan dust high in the skies over Europe caused some spectacular sunsets in February. Many of us found dust on our cars, and Alpine snow has been stained orange, but finding out how much Saharan dust we are breathing has always been difficult. For decades we have been measuring the amount of particle pollution in the air, but not what it is made of. However, university-run air observatories in London, Birmingham and Manchester are now making real-time chemical analysis. They showed that silicon, aluminium, calcium and iron particles from Saharan dust were the main particle pollutants in all three cities on Saturday 20 February and that the dust was breathed by Londoners for the next two days. Saharan dust events are common in Mediterranean countries. It is also carried west on Atlantic trade winds. Dust from north Africa fertilises the Amazon, but it also causes air pollution problems in Caribbean islands and the southern US. Desert dust is not like builder’s sand; it contains many biological particles and allergens. A recent study in Miami found increased hospital visits for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease during Saharan dust events. Other studies have found problems for asthmatics, too. In June 2020 authorities in Cuba asked islanders to wear face masks and urged vulnerable people to stay indoors as a massive Saharan dust cloud travelled westwards. Alerting systems are being established across Spain and Portugal but there is need for more research into the health impacts of desert dust. Saharan dust can have a major effect on weather systems, suppressing hurricane formation and, by darkening snow, bringing forward spring thaws in the Alps. It is unclear if events will increase in the future. A dryer climate in north Africa may lead to more airborne dust but changes in weather patterns may reduce its spread. However, alpine ice cores covering the past two millennia suggests that Saharan dust has increased in the past 100 years. Also notable in the ice core record are the Saharan dust events between 1315 and 1365, a time that includes the Great Famine, when about 10% of Europe’s population perished, and the Black Death. This has led to speculation that poor air quality from Saharan dust may have contributed to a decline in human health and made the population more vulnerable.\\n',\n",

Her interviewees include Tan France, Queer Eye’s confident fashion expert who – in fact – was so insecure about his skin as a child that he used lightening creams, and model Ebonee Davis, who sees wearing her natural curls as a “form of rebellion”, and wants everyone to have follicular freedom. A warm, searching and thoroughly body positive look at, in Shimada’s words, how people “feel free to be themselves.” Hannah J Davies Cautionary TalesTim Harford’s podcast returns for a second season, with ways that people didn’t learn the lessons that history tried to hammer home. From the world’s worst bank robbery to how Harold Shipman could have been prevented from murdering hundreds of patients, there’s always something to take away from the stories. And they’re told in a brilliant way, with the help of dramatisations from actors including Jeffrey Wright and Helena Bonham Carter, who makes a very convincing Florence Nightingale in the episode about how data visualisation changed ideas about public health.

Photograph: Bobby Yip/Reuters   Chosen by Courtney Yusuf This series from the UAE masters the craft of telling “stories from the Middle East and North Africa, and the spaces in between”. Now in its sixth year, its winning combination of first-person-led investigations, expert witnesses, rigorous research, and beautiful sound design have produced an exciting catalogue of stories that offer a sideways glimpse into this interconnected world. The latest series has already asked questions like “how do Black Arabs consider their own identity and their own struggle against discrimination, particularly after George Floyd’s killing?”, “how did Kuwait’s thriving Indian community experience Saddam Hussein’s invasion?”, “what is it about K-Pop that speaks to thousands of Arab megafans?” and “who can determine where Jewish-Egyptian artefacts really belong today?” This is honest storytelling led by those from the region with a real love for its richness, and, while you may end up at the end of the journey with many things being true at the same time, it is refreshing to avoid lazy tropes or the belief that any place, person, or phenomenon could ever be understood through a single lens. The latest series is currently being released but do also check out a number of great episodes from previous series – the haunting Zabelle, centred on Armenian-American singer Zabelle Panosian, is one episode in particular that I keep returning to.

       "  'title': 'As Covid turns the crisis of social care into a calamity, the government does nothing | Polly Toynbee',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'A ghoulish figure was hidden away on page 135 of the Office for Budget Responsibility’s report on budget day last week. The 125,000 deaths from Covid so far will save the Treasury £1.5bn in state pensions by 2022; savings will continue to be made during all the years those people should have lived. That shocking death toll brings in more inheritance tax revenues, too. But those deaths are another blow to social care providers. A substantial proportion of the people who have died so far lived in care homes, and they have left empty beds and an even deeper financial hole. Occupancy dropped from over 90% to around 70%, according to Martin Green of Care England, and families are now more reluctant to put relatives into homes. This week, the National Audit Office has warned that 94% of councils will have to cut spending, and social care is the biggest slice of their stricken budgets. On Wednesday, Care England called on the chancellor not to axe relief funds on 1 April: the fund pays (inadequately) towards testing, infection control and extra staff in an industry with an estimated 100,000 shortfall. The Health Foundation says restoring care even to the meagre levels of 2010 would cost £12.5bn.  In other words, a crisis is becoming a calamity. Yet the chancellor said nothing on social care in the budget. Does it matter how many protest? Simon Stevens, head of NHS England, was vehement in his evidence to the Commons health committee this week that an urgent solution to social care and its staff shortages is needed. How can the forthcoming NHS bill create integrated care systems between the two services when the NHS is free but social care is means-tested? Some say Boris Johnson never had that “clear plan we have prepared” he promised on the steps of Downing Street. Others say there was one, but political advisers blenched at this wicked issue, where every solution involves political pain: either pay more tax, make older people pay a lump sum or a lien on their home on retirement, pay compulsory insurance, make young working people pay for property-rich older people, or lose inheritances in care charges? All would be seismically shocking to voters, few of whom know how paying for care works until their family is suddenly hit by the cost of it. The chancellor disingenuously called for “cross-party” working, but Liz Kendall, the shadow care minister, says: “This has not been discussed or even raised with Labour’s frontbench team, despite our repeatedly asking the care minister about this issue.” It’s a smokescreen to blame Labour later. Why not submit his entire budget to “cross-party” agreement? That’s not how politics works. When he was health secretary, Andy Burnham put up the only good plan – drawn up in a cross-party committee – from any recent government: on retirement, everyone with the means would pay a lump sum, or place a lien on their home, and thereafter care would be free. But just before the 2010 election, David Cameron withdrew Tory support so he could blast it as a “death tax”. Cynical electioneering trumped consensus. Ever since Margaret Thatcher privatised it, social care has been a hotchpotch of companies running homes and services. Some make a fat profit, as Caroline Abrahams, head of Age UK, points out; a luxury Surrey home for private clients can cost £3,000 a week, while some big companies with highly leveraged debt and property financing put their profits in offshore tax havens. On the other hand, small operators such as Mike Padgham, who runs four St Cecilia homes in Scarborough, rely on private residents to cross-subsidise the paltry sum councils pay for those who are state-funded. At one point in the pandemic, the occupancy rate at Padgham’s homes dropped to 60%, and the chancellor’s withdrawal of Covid relief funding on 1 April is a disaster. Covid is not over. “Where is Matt Hancock’s ‘Care’ badge, when he claimed social care was equal to the NHS,” asks Padgham. “I think he only wore it once.” The government appears to have forgotten its promise to equalise the pay, training and esteem of care and NHS workforces. Don’t hold your breath for any plan, despite yet another “later this year” promise. Despite nightly TV pictures of heroic care workers, despite claps for carers, despite the deaths of many care staff, social care is a secret world. Here’s the hard political truth: social care features nowhere in the top 10 of Ipsos Mori’s regular Issues Index. The public are mostly clueless about its financing until they encounter the nasty shock of putting a relative in a home, and finding the cost falls on their inheritances. Andrew Dilnot, author of the official government report on the issue 10 years ago, says: “We know how to do this, we just need to get on and do it.” What will it take? Social care collapse is already here in worsening council finances. While nurses’ pay is political dynamite, hundreds of thousands of frail people are denied the care they would have had a decade ago, left home alone and hidden from view.

       "  'title': 'UK arts rescue fund has paid out just over half of money allocated',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'A government fund established to prop up the arts and heritage sectors during the coronavirus pandemic has handed over little more than half of the money it has allocated, Whitehall’s spending watchdog has discovered. The National Audit Office said the culture recovery fund had budgeted for £830m in grants and loans funding so far, but only £495m had been paid out. MPs have responded angrily to the findings, urging the government to hand over the cash while “there are still organisations left to support”. The Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport (DCMS) announced the £1.57bn fund to help the cultural, arts and heritage institutions survive the pandemic last summer. It has supported about 3,000 arts organisations in England so far, including venues such as the Royal Albert Hall and Southbank Centre in London, and M&S Bank Arena in Liverpool.     The fund was increased by £300m in the budget earlier this month, with the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, saying: “It’s such a relief we can look ahead now so this funding is not just about survival but for planning and preparing for the reopening of theatres, galleries and gigs.” But auditors have examined the allocation of the funds so far and found that of the £1bn that has been made available, about £830m in grants and loans has been awarded to different organisations but only £495m of that has been paid out, auditors said. The department has assumed, in the worst-case scenario, that social distancing would remain until the end of March this year, auditors pointed out, and that demand for theatre tickets and venue capacity would remain at 40% of pre-Covid-19 levels. But the current situation exceeds this worst-case scenario. Meg Hillier, the chair of the public accounts committee, urged payments to arms-length bodies to be sped up. “Many across the sector will have welcomed the funding announced last summer. But eight months later, more than half of the £1bn made available so far is still waiting in the wings. “With the sector’s shutdown already past government’s worst-case scenario, DCMS needs to get support out to organisations while there are still organisations left to support,” she said. Thursday’s report said the DCMS aimed to support the survival of 75% of the organisations in the sector at risk during 2020-21. Museums, galleries, cinemas, music venues and theatres had to close in March last year when the UK entered the first national lockdown. Some reopened partially in the summer and autumn but many have remained entirely or mostly closed for nearly a year.    The DCMS predicted that without targeted support organisations would run out of money around the end of September 2020, the report said. The department has not yet paid out any money from the second phase of funding, totalling £400m, comprised of funding not awarded in the first funding phase plus £258m that it held back as contingency. London has received 31% of total revenue grant funding, followed by the north-west and the south-east of England, which each received 12%, auditors said. Responding to the report, a DCMS spokesperson said: “It is right that we get funding out quickly with the safeguards taxpayers would expect to see in such a huge investment, and much more money has been invested into the sector since this report was compiled. “Applications are being processed for a £400m second round of grants and loans, and an additional £300m announced at the Budget will help the hardest hit reopen and recover. This brings direct support for the culture sector to almost £2bn.”\\n',\n",

       "  'title': \"Eddie Izzard: 'I'm just trying to create a space for myself'\",\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Eddie Izzard doesn’t understand what all the fuss is about. In December, it was reported that the standup comic/actor/campaigner/endurance runner had adopted the pronouns “she” and “her” and wanted to be “based in girl mode” from now on. Well, it hardly came out of the blue, she says today. Izzard had spent the past 35 years building up to it, and when she did finally make the announcement it happened by chance. A few months earlier, Izzard had been a guest on the Sky Arts series Portrait Artist Of the Year, and was asked, for the first time, which pronouns she preferred. She replied “she and her” and never gave it another thought. By the time the programme was broadcast, Izzard had forgotten about the conversation. And suddenly she was headline news. The funny thing, Izzard says, is that she had first announced she was trans in 2017 in the Hollywood Reporter and nobody had taken a blind bit of notice. But this time it was different. Within hours of the show being broadcast everything had changed – her Wikipedia entry and IMDb history were revised, and every media organisation was running stories about how he had become a she. Actually, Izzard says, she had not intended to be so definitive about it. She had always talked about being in boy mode most of the time and girl mode part of the time, and she was still hoping to keep her options open. For her first half century, boy mode had dominated, and now it was time for girl mode to take centre stage, but on occasions she would still like the freedom to be a he. She soon discovered that wasn’t an option, though.    Izzard doing standup at the Boulevard Theatre’s Raging Bull club night in the late 80s. Photograph: -   Take, for example, the new Netflix series she is currently working on in Manchester. In the adaptation of Harlan Coben’s thriller Stay Close, Izzard plays a small-town lawyer called Harry. “As I’m playing a male role, I suggested people should go back to calling me he and him for this, and what the world seems to have said to me is you can change your pronouns but you can’t use he and him as well. You’ve just got to be she and her from now on because we’ve only got so much time on our hands, thank you very much.” How does she feel about that? She beams. “Great. I’ve been promoted to she, and it’s a great honour.”   I’ve been promoted to she, and it’s a great honour   The thing is, she says, when she first came out as a transvestite in 1985, she was pretty much making the same statement she is now. For Izzard it was never just about having a thing for dresses and high heels, it was always about identifying as female. As far as she was concerned, being a transvestite simply meant being transgender without physically transitioning. She says she was four years old when she first had an inkling that she was transgender, even if she had no words for it back then. Izzard is big on self-analysis. Read her memoir Believe Me, and the two most important dates are dissected time and again – first, when Izzard was six and her beloved mother died, and second, the day she first stepped out in a frock and lippy. Both shaped her future. After her mother’s death she realised she would never again feel so lost and betrayed by the world. Everything she has done since then, she says, has been for her mother – not only to make her proud, but also in the hope of somehow bringing her back. Meanwhile, coming out at the age of 23 was the toughest thing she has done. It emboldened her as much as it terrified her – from then on she knew she could take on anything because nothing would be so scary.    Today we are Zooming to discuss her new movie – an entertaining if rickety second world war spy thriller, in which Izzard stars alongside Judi Dench. Six Minutes to Midnight is yet another first for Izzard – her debut as a screenwriter. The film is very loosely based on a remarkable true story about a tiny girls’ school in Bexhill-on-Sea (one of a number of places Izzard grew up in as the family regularly moved because of her father’s job with British Petroleum) whose students were all German, including daughters of the Nazi high command. But Izzard being Izzard, the movie is hardly the only thing on her mind. Yes, acting is her priority at the moment, but she is also planning a standup tour of Spain in Spanish. Then there is her solo performance of Dickens’s Great Expectations, which she hopes to take to the US. Oh yes, and in January she raised more than £300,000 for charity by doing 32 virtual marathons and 31 standup gigs in 31 days. Her appetite for ever more audacious challenges is as huge as her ambition to succeed. And finally there is politics. Izzard tells me she is planning to win a seat for Labour at the next general election, and if by some quirk she fails to she will stand again and again till she does win. There have been few performers with the stamina or self-belief of Eddie Izzard. I tell her I’m exhausted just listening to her itinerary. Doesn’t she get knackered? “No,” she says. Again, it goes back to the early days. From the age of seven, she was desperate to act, but she never got chosen for anything. So she insinuated herself into school plays – when the cast were rehearsing Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, she hovered by, uninvited, and when the drama teacher wanted a table moving she would move it. Her persistence paid off when she was given one line in the musical. At the age of 15 she broke into Pinewood Studios in the hope that somebody would spot her potential. Nobody did, and she was turfed out. At school she already had that hunger to achieve and impress. She was expected to do nine O-levels, but opted for 12.    ‘There was 23 years of twiddling my thumbs’ … Izzard performing in 1996. Photograph: David Corio/Getty Images   Alongside her outre persona, there has always been something rather conservative about Izzard. As a teenager she wanted to join the special forces (till she discovered she couldn’t pick and choose her wars), and believed strongly in moderation and the rule of law. One of her favourite expressions is “cool and groovy”, and never does she sound more establishment than when she says it. She studied sciences at A-level, started a degree in accounting at the University of Sheffield and left a year later to pursue a career as a street performer.   I went through such hell since ’85 that the idea that I’ve come out recently just sounds ridiculous   She honed her comedic skills by talking to (often imaginary) audiences on the streets as an escapologist. Inspired by the Goons and Monty Python, she developed her own brand of stream of consciousness riffing. Izzard’s humour is a form of mental contortionism, twisting crazy concepts one way then another before reaching even more half-baked conclusions. She never made any headway till establishing herself as a standup comic at the age of 30. And this, she says, is why nothing exhausts her now. “I was seven and I was ready to go. So there were 23 years of twiddling my thumbs waiting for things to get going. And when it did get going I thought I’m way behind, I’ve got to catch up.” She pauses. “I realise now if I go towards things slowly they tend to work.” While many transgender people suffer terrible gender dysphoria because they believe they have been born into the wrong sex, Izzard continued to seesaw between girl mode and boy mode. Perhaps because of this there has been a tendency to dismiss her as attention-seeking or whimsical. But she insists this could not be less true. In January, she told the Big Issue: “I went through such hell since ’85 that the idea that I’ve come out recently just sounds ridiculous.”    Izzard at the opening of the Bravehearts: Men in Skirts exhibition in New York City, 2003. Photograph: Sipa Press/Rex Features   Can she describe that hell? “There’s the self-analysis I did lying on the bed with the curtains closed trying to walk through my mental passageways, and my brain not letting me do it. Then there’s the coming out – the people hurling the abuse, and what do you do. And then there’s the panic attacks that happened most days, several times a day. You start sweating, and if it’s in the summer months and you’re panicking, you bucket with sweat and you think: ‘My God, I’m sweating.’ So you sweat even more.” The panic attacks only stopped a few years ago. Izzard shows me how people used to laugh in her face. She moves her face forward so she is virtually headbutting the screen. “People would stand this close, and say: ‘What the fuck is that? What the fuck is that?’ They turn you into an it.” Did it scare her? “No, it infuriated me. I want to fight everyone that says things like that.” There is another fight, though, that she thinks is utterly pointless – between some trans women and some feminists. She believes they should be allies rather than enemies. “It saddens me. How do we change that conversation? I can’t come up with a magic wand and provide an answer for everyone. I’m just trying to create a space for myself and anybody else who wants to slipstream behind that. But if you sat me down with some radical feminists I’m not sure whether we would sort everything out.” She thinks it’s a waste of political energy. “I’d like to get to the place where we don’t have to have this fight because I’m trying to deal with rightwing fascists and what they say.”    With Judi Dench in Six Minutes to Midnight. Photograph: Film PR Handout   Izzard, aged 58, is dressed soberly in a shirt and jacket, and could easily pass as a politician. In fact, she says this is how she will dress when (not if) she wins her seat. Has she talked to Labour about standing in the next election? “Yes, I’ve told everybody that I can tell that I want to stand. But still, a lot of other people want to stand, so nothing is a given.” Is she as determined about this as she has been about her standup, acting and running? “Yep. I’m not mucking about with this. I’m going in. If something goes wrong, if I stand in a byelection and I don’t get in, I’ll still go on. It doesn’t really matter because I am a relentless bastard.” She’s had to be, she says – after all, she has chosen the path of most resistance in everything she has pursued. So after climbing to the top of the standup mountain she walked back down and started again at the bottom of the acting mountain. And now, having made a respectable career for herself in acting, she is preparing to give it all up for Westminster.   If moderate people don’t go into politics then you leave it to egotistical extremists who are happy to lie   Why is it so important for her to go into politics? “If moderate people don’t go into politics then you leave it to egotistical extremists who are happy to lie. Moderates have got to go in. I’m a radical and a moderate.” In what way? “I do radical things, but my politics are moderate. I perform in French, German and Spanish as well as English when I’m a standup, so that’s slightly radical. And I’m radical because I came out as transgender. I’ve run about 130 marathons for charity. That’s slightly radical.”    ‘I do radical things but my politics are moderate’ … speaking at a Labour election rally, 2015. Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo   Why does she do all the marathons – are they an obsession? Again she returns to her early life and trans issues. “No. It’s more feeling I never did enough when I was younger.” How has running changed her? “It’s been great for my mental health. Great for reclaiming the sort of fitness I had as a kid. It’s also changed people’s attitude towards me, too – being a trans person who is an endurance runner is no bad thing.” In what way? “People don’t expect a trans woman to be able to run 130 marathons for charity and it changes their sense of what a trans woman is. I can see in their eyes they go: well, fair play.”   Relationships with me are tricky. You’ve got to be a woman who’s very self-confident about your  sexuality   In so many ways, she is bursting with self-belief. But Izzard says she has never found relationships easy. As a kid, she struggled to make an impression on girls she fancied. When she grew up, it didn’t improve much. And now as an out trans woman she reckons it may get a whole lot harder. “Relationships with me are tricky. You’ve got to be a woman who’s very self-confident about your own sexuality to go out with me.” There have been few relationships in her adult life, partly because she is so often on the road working or running, partly because she is happy with her own company. Does she prefer not being in a relationship? “I don’t think I prefer it but I’m not going to agonise over it.” I ask if it’s easier to be a trans woman now that she’s getting older. “It’s true older men and older women look quite a lot similar. There’s a middle area where it’s much trickier. Visually, there’s not so much difference between older men and older women, so it does get easier.”    Izzard running for Sport Relief, 2009. Photograph: Alfie Hitchcock / Rex Features   Is she worried that transitioning may harm her career? After all, she worked so hard to be recognised as an actor, and now casting directors may well be unsure what to do with her. “Yes, potentially, but that was there already. So yes, it is a thought, and a lot of people wouldn’t come out because they felt that was going to screw up their career.” Again, she says she has been astonished by some reactions. “Some people are going: ‘Are you serious?’ I have floated this thing up as slowly as I fucking can. Thirty-five fucking years, mate, how much warning do you need?” But she says she has had plenty of practice taking on hecklers on stage and in real life. “I was the right person to come out because if people were going to hurl abuse at me in the streets, as they have done, I would hurl it back. Sometimes it would just be us standing in the street swapping abuse or if they fight me, I’ll fight them back.” At the moment, Izzard is self-identifying as a trans woman. Does she think she will ever physically transition? “I might do. I feel that boy mode has had a good innings in this one life that we get. It would be great to get up in the morning and think I look like a woman so I’m going to throw on a tracksuit and have breakfast. It is getting better and better. I do feel I can express myself in a more feminine way, which may be the age thing.” Would she like boobs? “Yeah! I’ve had boob envy since my teens. Just when teenage girls of my age were going ‘I want boobs’, I was thinking yeah me too. But I couldn’t say it. They talk about penis envy, and I believe some women suffer penis envy. I cannot for the life of me get my head around this. But yes, I’ve always had breasts envy.” We’re coming to the end of our time. As she talks, I’m thinking how she has grown into her face over the years. Her features seems softer and more feminine these days. I ask if she is taking hormone pills. She smiles and, for once, declines to answer. “I’m very happy to transition and I feel I have been transitioning,” she says. “But I do feel I’ve told everybody everything in my life, so I’m going to keep a certain amount of privacy.” • Six Minutes to Midnight is available on Sky Cinema and Now TV from 26 March. • This article was amended on 12 March 2021 to change a reference to body dysmorphia to gender dysphoria.\\n',\n",

The app is called Wombo AI, and while the future of artificial intelligence and the ability to make fake videos of real people strikes fear into the hearts of many experts, some say that Wombo could help by raising awareness of “deepfakes”. Wombo CEO Ben-Zion Benkhin said he came up with the idea “while smoking a joint with my roommate on the roof”. The app launched in Canada in February and has since been downloaded on Apple’s App store and Google Play more than 2m times.   Related: What are deepfakes –\\xa0and how can you spot them?   There are 15 songs users can choose from, including Michael Jackson’s Thriller and the more recent Gunther’s Ding Dong Song. The app’s creators filmed a performer singing each song – and executing specific eye, facial and lip movements, Benkhin told Insider. These background videos help the AI animate any uploaded image. “I’ve been following the AI space, following the meme space, following the deepfake space, and just saw the opportunity to do something cool,” Benkhin said.  However, Wombo may avoid the potential harm posed by deepfakes, or fake videos of real people that look real. A video created by Wombo “looks realistic but doesn’t look real”, Benkhin told Insider.

However, he said the app’s videos were so clearly fake that they might teach users to mistrust future videos where world leaders, for example, were filmed doing or saying something ridiculous.

There was nothing inherently wrong with computer-generated videos, he said, and because the app was engaging, it might teach people about the existence of deep fakes and how easy it is to create them.

       "  'full_article': 'Along the footpath that leads to the Hatchmere nature reserve, there are signs of management everywhere. Plastic tree guards wrapped around saplings, a corrugated metal dam blocking a brook, three bat boxes pinned to a Scots pine. Beneath my feet, where the rich, black soil oozes with the overflow of feeder streams, logs have been buried for stability before the path finally transforms into a boardwalk. From this elevation, you get a good view of the latest construction project: a robust fence, angled to protect what’s inside. On the other side of the fence live some effective subcontractors, a pair of beavers brought in to manage the environment with their traditional tools of tooth and claw. They were reintroduced to Cheshire three months ago, and have had a wet welcome, thanks to the rainiest winter in 21 years. The county claims to have more ponds than any other in England, and a wealth of watery habitats, so it’s hoped the beavers will feel right at home. I heard that the beavers patrol their perimeter after dark, so I plan a dusk visit. In the creation of the compound, some trees have been cleared from the edges for security. They now lie in piles, conveniently providing the beavers with food and fodder. But in the fading light I struggle to recognise much from the tantalising videos released by the Cheshire Wildlife Trust, which manages the project. Clips from within the enclosure show slick trails made by beaver tummies and tails, branches gnawed to expose the white inner bark, a lodge freshly burrowed under brambles and covered with twigs, and possibly the beginnings of their first canal to link two ponds. These workers certainly haven’t been slouching through the wet weather,; hard graft is going on out of public view. I strain my senses for some evidence, and I can just hear the water trickle through the ditch between the boardwalk and the beaver fence, now accompanied by a blackbird in melodious voice. I stay long enough to hear nature’s shift change: mallards blast their calls as they commute overhead and a male tawny owl begins to woo. Following the beavers will remain a virtual experience for a little longer at least. • Country Diary is on Twitter at @gdncountrydiary\\n',\n",

       "  'full_article': \"Comfort Obinna sat in the shade of a mango tree she planted 25 years ago, above a sea of broken blocks of concrete. The rubble covers the compound that used to be her modest home on Tarkwa Bay Beach in Lagos. Now nearly everything the 73-year-old owned, including the space where she farmed her chickens and pigs, has been lost. “I planted this tree in 1996,” Obinna said, grasping the trunk and breaking into tears. “Look at where I sleep,” she added, pointing to a makeshift bed made from rags and strips of wood. “I don’t have anywhere else to go so I stay here.”   Related: 'I'm a fighter': WTO's first female, African head ready for battle   Since December 2019, Nigerian authorities have destroyed hundreds of homes and businesses in waves of violent mass evictions on the lagoons and islands that dot the waterways of the country’s largest city, leaving thousands of mostly poor people homeless. Many, like Obinna, continue to live in the rubble of their demolished compounds, with nowhere else to go. The port authority and the navy units that carry out the evictions accuse residents of either stealing oil from the pipelines that run beneath the waterways or turning a blind eye to the theft, thereby depriving the city’s coffers of revenues.    A month after the demolitions began, Lagos’s government announced its intention to build a tourist resort on Tarkwa Bay. Photograph: Emmanuel Akinwotu   But residents say the accusations are a smokescreen, and that the real reason for the evictions is to clear valuable seafront expanses for luxury commercial developments and beachfront getaways for the middle class, which have sprung up across the islands. A month after the demolitions began, Lagos’s government announced its intention to build a tourist resort on Tarkwa Bay. Across the water, on sand dredged from the sea, a handful of skyscrapers mark the site of Eko Atlantic, an enormous and controversial “private city” development off the coast of Victoria Island. According to the Justice Empowerment Initiative, a Lagos-based organisation that provides training and resources for people in poor communities, tens of thousands of people, several with roots going back generations on the islands have been displaced from Tarkwa Bay and nearby islands. Many – like Obinna – are migrants and refugees from along the west African coast.  Lagos map  Some have moved to other islands where demolitions are less frequent, others to informal settlements on the mainland, where by some estimates two-thirds of the city’s population of 15 million live. The prevalence of the informal settlements is a direct result of a lack of affordable housing: social housing is virtually nonexistent, and exorbitant private rents are beyond the means of many. The navy says all evictions take place after adequate notice is given, but this is heavily disputed by residents and campaigners who say they take place suddenly and in defiance of property rights. In January 2020, the high court ruled in a case brought by several communities against the navy and the Nigerian government that the demolitions must stop, but they continue regardless. Mohammed Zanna lived on Tarkwa Bay for 12 years in a small room attached to a home before it was demolished last year. He and many others are now fighting the evictions in court, supported by the Nigerian Slum/Informal Settlement Foundation, a grassroots organisation representing vulnerable communities.    The beach at Tarkwa Bay. Photograph: Emmanuel Akinwotu   “Forced evictions are illegal under human rights law,” he said. “Even the Nigerian constitution and law guarantees the rights to adequate shelter, housing for all. There must be due process and resettlement planning but this never happens.” On a recent morning in Tarkwa Bay navy vehicles patrolled through the sandy roads, between now demolished expanses of homes and businesses. Signs bearing the logo of the Nigerian Army Post Exchange dominated the beachfront, and army officers guarded and operated a chic white hotel and poolside lounge, where rooms cost up to $270 per night. A family evicted from their home in January of this year, who asked not to be named, said the navy ignored their pleas to be allowed to stay. Now they are squatting in a half-constructed building nearby.   Related: Nigeria cattle crisis: how drought and urbanisation led to deadly land grabs   As more upmarket entities spring up, “occupancy licences” granted to local businesses are being revoked by the Nigerian Port Authority. Locals allege that the few remaining small businesses making money on the beachfront are either run by the military or forced to pay extortionate commission fees to stay in private hands. Plastered around the bay are large posters erected by the armed forces, banning “homosexuality”, “drones” and unlicensed businesses. “They [the military] control everything on Tarkwa Bay,” said Dare, a commercial boat rider, as he ferried planks of pinewood from the beach that he had stripped from his father’s home. “We have to tear down the house because if we don’t, we know what will happen,” he said. “We thought, it’s better to take our materials rather than let them destroy it.”    The navy and army set up a convenience store and luxury hotel last year. Photograph: Emmanuel Akinwotu   Taibat Lawanson, an associate professor of urban planning at the University of Lagos, said low-income communities have paid the price of every attempt by local authorities to expand and develop the city. The problem stems in part from antiquated, unreformed land ownership laws dating from the 1970s. Land and property is sold and leased in a range of ways, Lawanson said, and many poor people do not have the proof of ownership that authorities often demand before proceeding with evictions. “Many people are unable to move from holding a receipt (for their land) to having the land officially registered with the state government,” Lawanson said. “When they do, they have to go through this process of ratification, which is essentially buying the land twice. “The challenge that low-income communities have is that they lack political capital, they don’t have influence, and their land is usually located in a place that has economic potential beyond its current use.” Obinna, who fled to Lagos from Liberia in the 1970s, recalls the moment she lost her home. “They brought a caterpillar and levelled everything just like that,” she said. “They didn’t give any notice. I told them this is my land, bought for me by my former boss, but they didn’t care.”\\n\",\n",

       "  'title': 'Yemen war: mass displacement fears as fighting intensifies in Marib',\n",
       "  'full_article': \"Residents in the Yemeni province of Marib are bracing for what could be the worst mass displacement of the war as a Houthi rebel offensive intensifies, leaving more than 2 million people trapped. Marib, which is controlled by parties loyal to the Yemeni government, has faced intermittent attacks from rebel forces over the last year as the Houthis have steadily gained ground in the area. A renewed assault since last month, however, has quickly morphed into one of the most ferocious battles of the seven-year-old war. The frontline is getting closer to Marib city – a development that threatens to exacerbate what is already the worst humanitarian crisis in the world and severely undercut the peace process.   Related: UK 'balancing books on backs of Yemen's starving people', says UN diplomat   Ballistic missiles, drones and other projectiles are hammering the town and its outskirts, while the Saudi-led coalition supporting the Yemeni government has stepped up bombing of Houthi positions across the country. Estimates vary widely but several hundred combatants and scores of civilians are believed to have been killed in the violence. Marib, an oil-rich desert town 75 miles (120km) east of the capital, Sana’a, was home to approximately 400,000 people before the war. Since local forces managed to fend off an initial Houthi attack in 2015, however, the area has been seen as a safe haven for those fleeing fighting elsewhere in the country, and its population has swollen to about 2.7 million. There are 138 poorly serviced displacement camps in the area, some of which have been hit in the recent violence. Five camps have been abandoned and their residents relocated since February, Yasmin al-Qadhi, the head of the Marib Girls Foundation, said in a media briefing on Wednesday.  Graphic    Hamas al-Muslimi, a student who has lived in Marib for several years, said: “We are worried the fighting is going to head towards another bad turn. It’s very unstable. The fighting is just a few kilometres away now … but there is no other place for us to go.” Yemen’s war broke out in 2014 after the Houthis stormed Sana’a, causing the president to flee to neighbouring Saudi Arabia in early 2015. It escalated sharply when a coalition of Arab nations led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates intervened to oust the Iran-backed rebels. The coalition, which is supported and armed by western nations including the UK, has been widely criticised for bombing campaigns that have indiscriminately targeted civilian infrastructure, and for a blockade of Yemen’s airspace, borders and ports that has helped drive half of the 29-million-strong population into hunger. The Houthis have imposed repressive pseudo-religious rules on people living in areas under their control, the latest of which involves restricting women’s access to birth control. They are routinely accused of detaining and torturing dissidents and of siphoning off aid. The escalation in Marib appears to have been triggered by the withdrawal of Saudi troops from the area last year. Most of the conflict’s other frontlines – notably in the cities of Taiz and Hodeidah – have largely been static for years. “The battles [elsewhere in Yemen] have stopped. This has affected the intensity of the assault on Marib, with all of the Houthi forces concentrated on trying to advance and make a breakthrough into Marib,” said the province’s governor, Sheikh Sultan al-Aradah, in a briefing organised by the Sana’a Center thinktank this week. “There is no doubt that coalition air power [is making a difference in Marib]. Without their support, the situation would look very different.” The fighting comes as Joe Biden is pushing for the resumption of UN-sponsored talks to end the conflict. The Houthis, however, have also stepped up attacks on Saudi soil. In Iraq, Iran-backed militias have launched a new series of rocket attacks on US installations, putting pressure on a fledgling administration seeking to re-engage Tehran in negotiations over its nuclear programme. In 2018, a UN-brokered ceasefire managed to stop a coalition assault on Yemen’s crucial port city of Hodeidah. But according to Aradah and a UN source with knowledge of the discussions, the Houthis – who have nothing to lose in the battle for Marib – are less willing to engage this time. Marib is the Yemeni government’s only northern stronghold: its fall would greatly weaken their negotiating position and derail diplomatic efforts to end the war. “If the Houthis seize Marib, all manner of conflict will manifest and transform the war into sectarian, ethnic, and regional struggles … It will take life, and with it the people, to a hell that burns everyone with its fire, directly or not,” said Qadhi.\\n\",\n",

       "  'title': \"Century-old olive trees felled as Spain's farmers try to cut costs\",\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Century-old olive trees are being chopped up to use as firewood or sold off as garden ornaments as some in Spain’s olive oil industry turn to younger, more productive trees in hope of lowering costs. In recent years the sector in Spain has been left reeling; a plunge in global olive oil prices was followed by a punishing 25% tariff levied by the US on Spanish olive oil. After prices sank to levels that left many struggling to break even, the industry has slowly recovered, though prices remain shy of 2018 levels. The volatility has left some uprooting the trees that have fuelled olive oil production for generations. “It’s a pity about these century-old olive trees,” Juan Antonio Galindo, the owner of a 40-hectare farm near Seville recently told the broadcaster RTVE. “But I have to cut them down to switch to intensive farming … the difference is huge.” He estimated the move would cut his production costs by more than 70%. While many felled olive trees end up being sold as garden ornaments, he doubted that his trees would find a buyer. Instead, they would likely be used as firewood, he said. “It’s a blow to see your trees have to go, but the wallet is also important.” Rafael Pico, who heads the Spanish association of olive oil exporters, said about 70% of Spanish olive oil producers were small-scale operations that often relied on traditional farming methods. “Inevitably – and this is my opinion – there will be a restructuring of these olive groves towards intensive and super-intensive farming,” he said, pointing to the growth of intensive olive farming in Australia and the US. “If not they could find themselves left out of the market.” Global competition is likely to intensify, after the EU and the US reached a deal to temporarily suspend the tariffs on Spanish olive oil, along with several other retaliatory tariffs brought in during Donald Trump’s presidency. While there were olive farmers switching to intensive production, these cases were far from the norm, said Cristóbal Cano of the Unión de Pequeños Agricultores y Ganaderos, which represents about 80,000 small-scale farmers in the country. “It’s not the majority that are uprooting century-old olive trees to intensively farm.” Some had instead sought to embrace the singularity of Spain’s oldest olive trees. From the Valencian municipality of Traiguera to the southern Spanish town of Casabermeja, farmers are producing olive oils that are vibrantly infused with the history of these trees. These efforts have been boosted by legal protections; lawmakers in Catalonia last year voted to strengthen protections for the region’s oldest olive trees, echoing similar legislation introduced in Valencia in 2006. “Changing from traditional to super-intensive farming isn’t the only way to achieve profitability,” said Cano, arguing that social and environmental factors must also be considered. “This triple sustainability is what you need to achieve,” he said. “I think that olive growers are increasingly conscious that our future lies in the differentiation of our olive oils and in conveying to consumers the social and environmental impacts that are at play behind each litre of olive oil.”\\n',\n",

       "  'full_article': 'Australia has been urged to seize a leadership role in promoting health security across the Indo-Pacific, with analysts highlighting efforts by China and Russia to increase their regional influence through “vaccine diplomacy”. Access to Covid-19 vaccines is likely to be one of the main items on the agenda when Scott Morrison joins a virtual meeting with the US president, Joe Biden, and the prime ministers of Japan and India on Saturday morning Australian time. It will be the first-ever meeting of leaders from the four “Quad” countries, an informal grouping that China views warily as an effort to contain its growing influence.   Related: Vaccine diplomacy: west falling behind in race for influence   On the eve of the talks, a new report by the University of Sydney’s United States Studies Centre argues the Quad “provides a key opportunity to now strengthen regional health security, which reflects long-standing shared interests by all four governments”. Adam Kamradt-Scott, an associate professor from the University of Sydney and a specialist in global health security and international relations, said Australia should launch discussions with the US, Japan and India for “a joint regional health security initiative”. Kamradt-Scott suggested the production and distribution of vaccines within the region as an immediate area for collaboration. In the longer term, he argued, the governments should work to improve disease surveillance and response capacities. “China and Russia have actively engaged in ‘vaccine diplomacy’ to expand their influence and presence in countries of strategic significance to Australia, including Indonesia and Papua New Guinea,” Kamradt-Scott wrote. The ideas are outlined in health-related sections of a US Studies Centre report provided to Guardian Australia ahead of its formal release next week. Australia has already pledged $500m towards the distribution of vaccines in the region but pooling resources would help Australia boost its engagement in the region, wrote Matilda Steward, an honorary associate at the centre. “Enhanced health cooperation with the United States in south-east Asia and the Pacific would help to ensure a stable and prosperous Indo-Pacific, a key Australian national interest,” she wrote. Steward pointed to estimates that about 35 million infants in south-east Asia have missed routine vaccinations as a result of the pandemic, while pointing to concern about malaria risks in the Pacific. She called on Australia and the US to work together to help deliver routine immunisations that have been disrupted, or to counter infectious diseases at risk of re-emergence. Steward argued Canberra’s aid program is still focused primarily on the Pacific, Timor-Leste and Indonesia, despite Morrison’s recent statements that Australia is focused on the centrality of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean). Ahead of the first Quad leader-level talks, Morrison said he could not see why China would be concerned about the elevation of the grouping. The prime minister said the grouping brought together four liberal democracies with a long-term interest in the Indo-Pacific region, and it was about “standing up for our values”. “For us, this is where we live, this is where Japan lives, this is where India lives and, of course, the United States across the Pacific has had a long-term presence,” the prime minister told reporters in Sydney on Friday. “This is about an anchor for peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific and that benefits all nations of the Indo-Pacific.” The meeting is being held just days after China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, called for “true multilateralism” and argued against exclusive groupings. “Building small circles in the name of multilateralism is in fact ‘group politics’,” Wang said on Monday.   Related: Chinese students in Australia fear reprisals at home if they speak out, inquiry hears   The White House said this week that Biden’s decision to make the Quad one of his earliest multilateral engagements “speaks to the importance we place on close cooperation with our allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific”. Biden has retracted or overturned several Trump administration policies relating to global health, including re-engaging with the World Health Organization. While some have interpreted this as the US returning to its former global leadership role, the US Studies Centre report says “the reputational damage will take longer to repair”. Kamradt-Scott said Australia should seize the opportunity “to work closely with the United States to repair the country’s standing in the global health community while simultaneously strengthening regional and global health security”. While Australian interests are best served by seeing the US re-engage with the global health community, he also said the Biden administration is likely to be focused on turning around its own domestic Covid-19 challenges. Earlier this week, international aid groups, health organisations and unions called on the Morrison government to support a World Trade Organization proposal designed to allow developing countries to make and sell cheap copies of patented vaccines.\\n',\n",

       "  'full_article': 'A dead whale carcass beached at Phillip Island, south of Melbourne, is quickly decomposing, leaving locals retching over the putrid smell and rotting blubber. The sperm whale, measuring more than 16 metres, washed up on Forrest Caves beach last Saturday. A Phillip Island local, Mat Bowtell, who founded the charity Free 3D Hands, went with his staff during their Wednesday lunch break to pay their respects to the whale. The experience reminded him of a scene from Fight Club, he said, when Brad Pitt’s character steals fat from a liposuction clinic. “They throw the fat over the fence, and the bag breaks, and it just pours all over him and he’s just gagging – it’s just like that,” Bowtell told Guardian Australia. “You are walking towards this whale – this beautiful, majestic creature – and suddenly you can feel your feet getting heavier and heavier. And you look down and it’s just curdled sand. All this fat and blubber has washed out to sea and been brought back up to the high tide mark.   Related: Inside the rescue of the pilot whales stranded in Tasmania   “It’s like you have dipped your foot in a grease tray. And the more you try and rub it off, the more it is rubbing in.” Bowtell regrets wearing his favourite shoes – a pair of blue suede Jordans – on the sand, because he was worried that they would get stolen if he left them by the stairs. “It’s funny in hindsight,” he said. “Having my shoes stolen by the stairs would have been better because you can’t give them away now.” Locals have taken to social media to describe the smell of the decaying carcass. “I expected it to maybe smell a bit like rotten fish (which is bad enough) but this was like nothing I’ve ever smelt before,” Samantha Hutchinson commented on a public Facebook post about the beached whale. “We didn’t get closer than 30 metres but all had to shower and wash hair to get rid of the smell. It stays in your nostrils and throat for hours.” Another user named David Clarke wrote: “If the wind is blowing the right way you can smell it on Phillip Island Road when you go past.” Bowtell agreed that the stench was “putrid”, and locals even 5km to 6km away were saying they could smell it. “I was wearing a mask on the beach but it doesn’t matter,” he said. “It travels through you, your body absorbs it. It felt like my entire nose and lungs were coated in this rotting flesh. “But there were no seagulls or flies near the body. They don’t even want to get close to it.” Bunurong Environment Centre’s education officer and a Phillip Island local, Mike Cleeland, told Gippsland ABC Radio that he suspected a giant squid had attacked the whaleafter noticing “sucker marks” on the side of its body. “These sperm whales dive down a kilometre or more in depth to feed on the giant squids, but if they come up to a squid and the squid tries to defend itself by wrapping itself around the sperm whale, they finish up with these sucker marks and that was apparent on this one at Forrest Caves,” Cleeland said. “There is no obvious cause of death so it may have simply have reached the end of its natural life and washed in on this nearest beach here in Phillip Island.” Despite the odour, a spokesperson for Victoria’s Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning (DELWP) said the plan was to leave the whale to break down naturally. “The process of decomposition emits a strong odour, which indicates the natural process is well under way,” the spokesperson said. “DELWP, upon discovery of the carcass, conducted assessments for a number of options for the removal of the whale from the site, however, due to the whale’s location on the beach there is no access to remove the whale. “The public are encouraged to refrain from visiting the area due to the strong odour and risk of pathogens from the decomposing whale and reminded that it is an offence for people to be within 300 metres of the whale.” The spokesperson said the department was concerned about illegal interference with the carcass that took place overnight, after parts of the whale’s jaw were missing Friday morning.\\n',\n",

In a statement released by her lawyers, Company Giles, Higgins said she accepted the apology and wanted any extra money received as part of the settlement to go to a sexual assault organisation that specialised in supporting victims. “I am pleased that the minister has now withdrawn her comments and I accept her apology to me,” Higgins said. “This has been an immensely challenging period to me and I wish to reiterate that the only reason I have chosen to come forward is to help others. “Finally, any monies I have received from the minister, as part of this settlement of my claim against her over and above my legal costs, will be paid in full to an organisation that provides counselling and support for survivors of sexual assault and abuse in the Canberra area. These funds will assist them in this important work.” Reynolds’ comment was made in her open-plan office and was overheard by staff, including those on secondment from the defence department, some of whom raised concerns about the remark.   Related: NZ politicians attack Australian minister Peter Dutton for comparing deportees to 'trash'   Last week, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said Reynolds “regretted” the comment made in a “private” setting while under pressure during a stressful week.

But, equally, there have been others who have been drawn into this. They’re human beings. They say things that sometimes they deeply regret. “I would simply ask you, given the comment was made in a private place, that you offer the same generosity to how you’d perceive something you might have said, and perhaps apply the same standard to Linda Reynolds, who at the time was under significant stress. She deeply regrets it.” Morrison acknowledged the comment was “offensive” and should never have been made. “I don’t condone [it],” he said.

But in his first prime-time address, which marked the anniversary of America’s shutdown, the president warned that restrictions could be reinstated if the nation lets down its guard against the virus. “Tonight, I’m announcing that I will direct all states, tribes and territories to make all adults – people 18 and over – eligible to be vaccinated no later than 1 May,” Biden said in the East Room of the White House. “That’s much earlier than expected.” He went on to make clear that this does not mean every person can get their shot in the arm by then but they will at least be able to join a waiting list. It signified the growing confidence of an administration that Biden said remains on “a war footing to get the job done”.   Related: Biden signs $1.9tn Covid relief ahead of first primetime address as president   The president said his target of 100m vaccine doses in his first 100 days has already been exceeded, with the US now on track to achieve that figure on his 60th day. In a 24-minute speech that carefully balanced caution and optimism, Biden also announced that the federal government will create a website before 1 May to help people find vaccination sites and schedule appointments. He promised he would “not relent” until the virus is beaten but he needs every American to “do their part”. He then offered a tangible target with emotional resonance: “If we do this together, by July the fourth there’s a good chance you, your families and friends, will be able to get together in your back yard or in your neighborhood and have a cookout or a barbecue and celebrate Independence Day.” He added: “After this long, hard year, that will make this Independence Day something truly special, where we not only mark our independence as a nation, but we begin to mark our independence from this virus.” Trump was frequently criticised last year for setting wildly optimistic dates for reopening businesses and schools. With many states already lifting restrictions again, Biden was at pains to say the fight is far from over. “Because if we don’t stay vigilant and the conditions change and we may have to reinstate restrictions to get back on track,” he warned. “Please, we don’t want to do that again. We’ve made so much progress. This is not the time to let up.” Wearing a black mask, dark suit, white shirt, striped tie and white handkerchief in his breast pocket, Biden walked up a red carpet flanked by flags to make the address – the first on live television from the East Room since Donald Trump falsely claimed election victory at 2.20am on 4 November.    Joe Biden has pledged to direct states to make all American adults eligible for coronavirus vaccines by May. Photograph: Mario Tama/Getty Images   In remarks that were rooted in empathy and appeared to include some ad libs, the president took some shots towards his predecessor’s downplaying of the virus and dithering over mask wearing – though he did not mention by Trump by name. “A year ago, we were hit with a virus that was met with silence and spread unchecked, denials for days, weeks, then months,” Biden said. “That led to more deaths, more infections, more stress and more loneliness. Photos and videos from 2019 feel like they were taken in another era. The last vacation, the last birthday with friends, the last holiday with extended family. “While it was different for everyone, we all lost something – a collective suffering, a collective sacrifice, a year filled with the loss of life and the loss of living for all of us. But in the loss, we saw how much there was to gain in appreciation, respect, and gratitude. Finding light in the darkness is a very American thing to do. In fact, it may be the most American thing we do.” Biden reached into his pocket and took out a card on which he keeps a running total of the virus death toll. He said 527,726 Americans had lost their lives to it as of Thursday night. “That’s more deaths than in world war one, world war two, the Vietnam war and 9/11 combined.” Early White House projections based on expert modeling had suggested that 100,000 to 240,000 Americans could die from the virus.   Related: $1,400 stimulus checks and vaccine funds: what the Covid relief bill contains   Biden, whose own life has been scarred by tragedy, also reflected on the impact of job losses, business closures, evictions and children going a year without attending school. “It’s the details of life that matter the most, and we miss those details, the big details and the small moments, weddings, birthdays, graduations, all of the things that needed to happen but didn’t. “The first date, the family reunions, the Sunday night rituals. It all has exacted a terrible cost on the psyche of so many of us … The things we used to do that always filled us with joy have become things we couldn’t do and broke our hearts.” The president condemned the partisanship that has hurt America’s pandemic response and led to racist violence. “Too often, we’ve turned against one another. A mask, the easiest thing to do to save lives, sometimes it divides us. States pitted against one another instead of working with each other. Vicious hate crimes against Asian Americans who have been attacked, harassed, blamed and scapegoated.” Biden did not acknowledge the previous administration’s investment in Operation Warp Speed to produce vaccines, a sore point among Trump alumni. Kayleigh McEnany, a former White House press secretary, tweeted: “Even the media acknowledges the Trump administration’s role in spearheading vaccine development and procurement … but President Biden REFUSES to say the truth.” Biden spoke hours after signing a $1.9tn coronavirus relief bill passed by Democrats in Congress with no Republican votes. Striking another positive note, he said: “After long, dark years, one whole year, there is light and hope of better days ahead if we all do our part. This country will be vaccinated soon. Our economy will be on the mend. Our kids will be back in school.”\\n',\n",

       "  'full_article': 'German police say they have solved a nine-year-old burglary case after DNA found on a half-eaten piece of sausage matched that of a man detained in France over an unrelated crime. Police in the western town of Schwelm said on Thursday the sausage belonged to the victim, and the suspect – a 30-year-old Albanian citizen – appeared to have helped himself to a bite during the break-in in Gevelsberg in March 2012. Officers from the Nordrhein-Westfalen force said in a statement the DNA pattern did not produce a direct hit at the time but that automatic comparisons with international databases led to a link later on. The connection was made after French police took a DNA sample from a man involved in a violent crime that matched the burglary sample, alerting investigators. It was not clear what type of sausage – known in Germany as wurst – the burglar had nibbled, though police said it was a hard variety. However, the statute of limitations on the burglary has expired, meaning the suspect is unlikely to be extradited to Germany. Schwelm police said the suspect remains free.

       "  'title': \"Myanmar's junta – caught out by passion of protests – unleashes terror\",\n",
       "  'full_article': 'At first, sheets of paper featuring the face of Min Aung Hlaing were fixed on to the streets with sticky tape, ready to be stamped on by angry protesters in Myanmar’s main city, Yangon. Troops promptly removed the pages, only for resourceful demonstrators to return with stencils to paint the junta leader’s image on to the concrete. The protest tactic offered some protection against charging soldiers, who were apparently forbidden from treading on an image of their commander-in-chief. It was also a chance for the public to express their deep disdain for the man who stole their democracy. The decision by Min Aung Hlaing to seize power on 1 February brought an abrupt end to Myanmar’s transition, after decades of military rule, to a more democratic system, and prompted fury across the country. It also presented the military with one of the biggest challenges in its 80-year history, as protesters poured on to the streets of cities, towns and villages while vast numbers went on strike, bringing trade, banks and transport systems to a standstill. “It was a massive strategic miscalculation on their part,” said Richard Horsey, an independent political analyst, who added that the military appeared to have severely underestimated the level of public opposition. “But I think they still believe they can win this.” Faced with opposition across society, the military has been unleashing a campaign of terror and chaos. Protesters are being detained, brutally beaten and, increasingly, shot dead. After dark, trucks of troops swarm through residential areas, firing indiscriminately and setting off stun grenades. Every night homes are raided, with officers going door to door arresting protesters and anyone deemed to be sheltering them. About 1,800 people have been taken, although this is probably an underestimate. “The level of violence and intimidation that they’re having to mete out is creating a wellspring of hatred and opposition that is unifying much of the country,” added Horsey. “They will be able to deploy the violence that’s necessary to impose their will, but then what?” The military will be left presiding over a country with deep, multiple crises, he added, with far less domestic or international support.    Protesters barricade a Yangon road with women’s longyi. Photograph: Nyein Chan Naing/EPA   Min Aung Hlaing appeared to have thought protests would be more easily suppressed, and that he could win support from people frustrated with the leadership of Aung San Suu Kyi, who came to power in the 2015 elections, the first free vote in decades. Both assumptions have so far proved wrong. “I think the state administration council [the junta] probably calculated that there would be demonstrations, but they probably underestimated how sustained and creative these would be,” said Moe Thuzar, a co-coordinator of the Myanmar studies programme at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore. They also underestimated the potential impact of the protesters’ civil disobedience movement, she added, in which huge numbers of people have walked out of their jobs, paralysing the country. Faced with such widespread opposition, the junta is resorting to the authoritarian playbook of the past. The military’s brutal use of violence means far fewer people are now protesting. Many are still refusing to go to work, however, increasingly because they are too afraid to do so when the military is out on the streets. Min Aung Hlaing took over as commander-in-chief in 2011 as Myanmar began the transition to democracy, under a constitution that granted the military significant powers. He was due to retire soon and it was widely known he aspired to be president, a position Aung San Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy (NLD) refused to grant him. In an interview with Russia Today last June, a presenter praised his leadership qualities before adding that she hoped he would “be able to perform duties with higher authorities in the interest of the country, the world and world peace”. He replied: “I always have such desires.” When the military’s proxy party was humiliatingly trounced in November’s elections, and it became clear Min Aung Hlaing’s ambitions would not be realised at the ballot box, the military accused the NLD, without evidence, of election fraud – claims it used to justify the coup.     Min Aung Hlaing’s relationship with Aung San Suu Kyi was strained, and there was reportedly almost no face-to-face communication, with both apparently fearing what their counterpart was plotting. Analysts believe there was anger over what the generals considered Aung San Suu Kyi’s arrogant refusal to consider their concerns regarding last year’s election, which only added to the military’s fear that they had become sidelined since agreeing to share power. In fact, the military had retained huge powers, including autonomy over defence, and received a greater share of the national budget than health and education combined, as well as retaining its lucrative business networks. Since the coup, some western governments have tried to target the army’s financial interests to pressure the regime to act with restraint – although the strike movement is inflicting far greater damage than potential sanctions could hope to do. Thuzar said the number of people participating varied across ministries, but in the ministry for natural resources and environment, 56% were refusing to work, according to one estimate.  “Even if only half the people in customs at a border trade post, the people who are supposed to process goods coming in, are participating, that slows things down. It affects the supply chain,” she said. One of the most brutal crackdown on protesters was against shipyard workers who had refused to work, apparently bringing trade to a standstill. “The current situation is testing the unity of the military in a way it has probably never been tested before,” Horsey said. There is no indication that the generals may turn against Min Aung Hlaing, although splits are not impossible. Most analysts agree that the military is so opaque that there is no way of knowing if there is disunity. “The only thing that is predictable is that the military does have the power to increase the violence and try to stamp this out,” said David Mathieson, an independent Myanmar analyst. “But at what cost?”\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'Scott Morrison says AstraZeneca vaccine is safe for Australians after reports of blood clots',\n",
       "  'full_article': \"Scott Morrison has sought to reassure Australians that the AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine is safe after some European countries suspended their rollouts of the jab during an investigation into cases of blood clots. The prime minister said he had discussed the reports with health department secretary, Brendan Murphy, who did not believe there was a need to change Australia’s classification of the AstraZeneca vaccine. Morrison also said Australia’s Therapeutic Goods Administration considered data from overseas rollouts as well as conducting its own testing of the vaccine batches being distributed across Australia.   Related: Australia news live: News Corp photographer condemns 'toxic' sexism at tabloids; AstraZeneca rollout won't be halted after EU concerns   Overnight, Denmark, Norway and Iceland announced they were temporarily halting all AstraZeneca vaccinations to investigate the cases, after the European Medicines Agency said 30 cases of “thromboembolic events” or blood clots had been reported among 5 million people who had received the jab in Europe so far. Italy followed Austria, Estonia, Latvia, Luxembourg and Lithuania in banning inoculations with one particular batch of 1m doses that was sent to 17 countries. Denmark’s national health agency said it was suspending AstraZeneca vaccinations for two weeks because a 60-year-old woman who was given a shot from the same batch had formed a blood clot and subsequently died. Morrison, who is acting health minister while Greg Hunt recovers from cellulitis, also attempted to quash criticism of his government’s slower than anticipated vaccine rollout after a concession from Murphy on Thursday that some Australians may only have had one dose by the October target that the government set for full vaccination. “This is not news,” Morrison said in Sydney on Friday morning, insisting that receiving just the first of two jabs could be considered vaccinating a population as it achieved the immediate protective benefits. But he acknowledged that he expected just 150,000 vaccine doses to be administered by the end of this week, and that the government had not been able to secure as much vaccine supply as it had hoped to by now. When asked if he was worried by concerns in Europe that the AstraZeneca vaccine had caused blood clots among a handful of millions of recipients, Morrison said: “I trust our Therapeutic Goods Administration and the advice that they give me. “All the data from all of the places that we have relationships with, which obviously includes Europe, is being fed into the TGA, and that data is examined and that’s what informs the decisions that we take here in Australia.   Related: Company responsible for Australian vaccine bookings previously fined for sharing patient data   “Remember, the batches that we distribute across Australia, those batches are tested here in Australia. They’re tested here by the TGA, I was watching them doing it just earlier this week, and so we have a very robust process for examining that.” Morrison said Australia had benefited from having a “front-row seat” on the vaccine rollout in countries which have had an “urgent crisis situation” and had to speed up their distribution. “The learnings from that have been taken into account as we’ve been rolling out the vaccine safely here in Australia,” Morrison said. Australia has secured about 54m doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine with 50m of them to be produced locally by CSL in Melbourne.\\n\",\n",

The Australian did however, cover Rudd’s appearance in two blog posts on the day. But here’s the thing: no Murdoch newspaper reported Rudd’s comments the next day. Crickets. Now it wasn’t an earth-shattering story, to be fair, and he did criticise the boss relentlessly, but other media including SBS, the West Australian, the Australian Financial Review, Nine, Guardian Australia, the New Daily and Ten covered it extensively. Rudd had cheekily tweeted to “get ready for fair and balanced Murdoch media coverage tomorrow”, but there was zero. A serve of biffo at lunchtime The Oz might not have published a story but the exchange between Rudd and the Australian’s Greg Brown was pretty entertaining lunchtime television. Brown hadn’t even got his question out when Rudd began to attack him as a partisan Murdoch operative, and accuse him of reading out a question dictated by his editors. The reporter kept his composure as he asked Rudd whether his behaviour as Labor leader fell short of proper workplace standards, and brought up an incident in 2009 when Rudd allegedly had made a flight attendant cry. Rudd: “You’re here in order to do a political job on me. That is what News Corporation does.

She is going out on top in the ratings after keeping Nine’s Today in second spot despite several changes of hosts, including the removal and then return of Karl Stefanovic. But Armytage’s ratings success didn’t always translate to a clear run in the media and she had some pointed words for the press.

We do know, however, that producer Rebecca Le Tourneau, formerly of 60 Minutes, approached Rudd for an interview and he not so politely declined.

Auckland moved to alert level 1 from midday on Friday, bringing it in line with the rest of the country, after the government declared the February outbreak to be contained. Hours earlier the prominent restaurateur Martin Bosley tweeted that it was “utterly ludicrous” the hospitality industry had to wait until 11.30am for a decision – prompting Ardern’s partner, Clarke Gayford, to wade in. “An inprinciple [sic] decision was decided but its [sic] all pending on final test results today,” Gayford wrote.  Martin an inprinciple decision was decided but its all pending on final test results today.— Clarke Gayford (@NZClarke) March 11, 2021  The opposition leader, Judith Collins, had also said the delay in the announcement was the “height of arrogance from a government that has shown itself devoid of understanding about the rigours of trying to operate a business” and that “Kiwis deserve more respect”. Announcing the alert level change, Ardern said a preliminary decision had been made late on Thursday afternoon but cabinet held the announcement to ensure no community cases were recorded overnight. Ardern said lifting the restrictions at midday, instead of midnight, was “unusual” for the government and reflected that it was “moving as fast as possible” after receiving up-to-date information. “What we’re being criticised for is this assumption that we made a decision and didn’t act on it. In fact what we did was try and maximise as much as possible, the ability to move early for businesses.”   Related: New Zealand orders review into handling of Covid to 'sharpen' response   Questioned by media, Ardern also denied that Gayford had information ahead of the announcement, saying he was referencing only what had been publicly stated.

But now we need to keep working hard to maintain the position that everyone have worked so hard for.” Auckland is preparing for an action-packed weekend with America’s Cup events, a Super Rugby Aotearoa match between the Blues and Highlanders at Eden Park on Sunday, and the Auckland Arts Festival under way until 21 March. • The subheading of this article was amended on 12 March 2021 to change an incorrect reference to Gayford being Ardern’s husband.\\n\",\n",

       "  'title': 'Independent review criticizes LA police for handling of George Floyd protests',\n",
       "  'full_article': \"  Sign up for the Guardian Today US newsletter  The Los Angeles police department has been criticised over its handling of the widespread protests that broke out over the summer after the death of George Floyd, with an independent review finding that poor planning led to chaos and mass arrests. The review, commissioned by the city council following nationwide demonstrations last year, was released on Thursday as the trial opens in Minneapolis for Derek Chauvin, the former police officer charged with killing Floyd on 25 May 2020. “On May 27 and 28, the protests in downtown Los Angeles were marred by an escalating level of violence and criminality. Initially, the (Los Angeles police) department treated these as isolated incidents, rather than as a manifestation of a larger expression of outrage that was spreading across the United States,” the report said. The LAPD did not immediately respond to the report. The review, headed by the criminal defense attorney Gerald Chaleff, found that LAPD commanders failed to establish a clear command structure for directing its response to the outbreak of violence, leading to a “chaos of command” that left officers unsure of who was in charge as events unfolded. “It appears the department believed that if protests arising out of George Floyd’s death occurred in Los Angeles that they all would be peaceful,” the report’s authors said. “In interviews with the review team, interviewees said they were surprised at the violence that occurred in the afternoon and evening hours at some protests.” Other mistakes cited in the analysis included poor training of officers in use of non-lethal weapons, and failing to anticipate that the protests could spread beyond the city’s downtown and lack of field jails. “Thousands of people were arrested throughout the protests without a clearly articulated plan for detentions, transportation and processing,” the report said. “Those arrested were detained at the scene of the arrests for hours, handcuffed on the pavement, detained in buses, and taken to remote locations, without water or the use of bathroom facilities.” The report also noted that the protests occurred during the pandemic, meaning that “officers and those arrested were in close proximity, not socially distancing, many without masks and thus at risk of being exposed to the Covid-19 virus.” Between 29 May and 2 June, the LAPD arrested more than 4,000 people, the report stated.   Related:  LA's top prosecutor adopted major reforms. Law enforcement is fighting to block every policy   A number of lawsuits have been filed against the city of Los Angeles and the LAPD in connection with these arrests and injuries incurred during these protests. “There are reports that people were struck in the face and head, causing significant injuries, some of which required surgery,” the report stated. “Not all people struck with less lethal munitions during the protests were engaging in criminal behavior. This appears to be in part due to the complex and rapid movement of the crowds and at times a lack of adequate training.” In all, the 101-page report had 67 findings and listed 10 recommendations that included a periodic audit that the LAPD is in compliance with all lawsuit settlements, an extensive study of less-lethal munitions, an update on use-of-force directives in large crowds and more instruction regarding the use of less-lethal munitions on crowds. The report noted that during the protests, 106 officers suffered injuries from “dangerous objects being thrown at them, lasers used to injure their eyes, and other methods used to injure the officers and incite the crowd of protesters”. In addition, 141 LAPD patrol cars were severely damaged and six were destroyed by fire and other forms of vandalism. Yet “despite the provocations, the police must be able to effectively address those who are committing criminal acts and causing disruption,” the report states. “One of the fundamental duties of policing is to protect the first amendment right to free speech, assembly and the right to petition the government for redress of grievances,” the report reads. ”\\n\",\n",

       "  'title': \"World at 'peak twin' as birth rates reach historic high, study finds\",\n",
       "  'full_article': \"Twins may be more common today than at any time in history, according to the first comprehensive survey of twin births around the world. Researchers analysed records from more than 100 countries and found a substantial rise in twin birthrates since the 1980s, with one in 42 people now born a twin, equivalent to 1.6 million children a year. According to the study, the global twin birthrate has risen by one-third, on average, over the past 40 years. Rather than seeing the trend continue, the world may have reached “peak twin”, the authors say, as the most recent data suggest some countries have begun to see twinning rates plateau or even fall from historic highs. “The trends are really quite striking,” said Christiaan Monden, a professor of sociology and demography at Oxford University. “Over the past 40 to 50 years we’ve seen a strong increase in twinning rates in rich, developed countries, and that has led to more twins in both a relative and an absolute sense than we’ve seen ever before.” Twins are born naturally when a fertilised egg spontaneously splits in half, leading to identical twins, or when the mother releases two eggs at once that are both fertilised, producing non-identical twins. Most now are born as a result of fertility treatments, such as ovarian stimulation or having more than one in vitro fertilisation (IVF) embryo transferred into the womb at the same time, a practice now discouraged in many countries on health grounds. While the birthrate for identical twins has barely changed over time, Monden and his colleagues found that naturally conceived, non-identical twins and twins born as a result of medically assisted reproduction – an umbrella term for a range of fertility treatments – had risen globally.    Five-year-old twins Syanda, left, and Andile Bhengu pose for a photograph during a celebration for the 21 pairs of twins at their primary school in Durban, South Africa. Photograph: Kim Ludbrook/EPA   The main drivers are increased access to hormone treatment, IVF and other fertility services but also the postponement of parenthood – the chances of having natural, non-identical twins increases with age and peaks at 35 to 39 years old. The researchers analysed twinning rates from 2010-15 in 165 countries covering 99% of the world’s population. For 112 of those, they examined further birth records for 1980-85, according a report in Human Reproduction. Globally, twinning rates have risen from nine to 12 per 1,000 births since the 1980s, but the picture varies substantially from country to country. The greatest rises are seen in North America (71%), Europe (60%) and Asia (32%). In the UK, twinning rates rose about 62% but are thought to have fallen since the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) launched a campaign to reduce multiple births in 2007. In the Oxford study, a decrease of more than 10% was found in only seven countries over the dates surveyed. Africa has a high rate of twins born naturally from two separate eggs, and according to the study 80% of twins are now born either in Africa or Asia. “The absolute number of twin deliveries has increased everywhere except South America,” Monden said. “In North America and Africa, the numbers have increased by more than 80%, and in Africa this increase is caused almost entirely by population growth.”    Raj Mathur, chair of the British Fertility Society: ‘I think we’ve reached a peak, in terms of twinning rates from medical interventions, certainly in the developed world.’ Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian     Related: Have you seen the price of sperm? It's time to democratise fertility treatment | Arwa Mahdawi   Raj Mathur, the chair of the British Fertility Society and a consultant gynaecologist at St Mary’s Hospital in Manchester, said: “It doesn’t surprise us that twinning rates have increased because the availability of assisted reproduction has increased and also because women are slightly older when they have their first children, and both those things will increase the twin rate. “But at same time it’s very likely that if you look at western Europe, particularly the UK and Scandinavian countries, you might find that the rates are lower than they were in 2010 and 2015. The HFEA and the UK sector have achieved a year-on-year reduction in multiple birth rates, which were once at 20% and are now around 10%. “I think we’ve reached a peak in terms of twinning rates from medical interventions, certainly in the developed world, but the spread of IVF in Africa and South America is still rather limited on a per capita basis, and there are vast numbers of sub-fertile people in Africa particularly who don’t have access to IVF. The challenge will be how to spread IVF to them without also giving them higher twin rates. “The majority of twin babies are absolutely fine, but there is no doubt that a twin pregnancy carries greater risks for the mother and the baby, so when we can avoid it we should avoid it. The principle we follow is neatly summed up by the phrase ‘one at a time’,” Mathur said.\\n\",\n",

       "  'full_article': 'Reclaim These Streets – the group planning to hold a vigil on Saturday evening close to the spot where Sarah Everard disappeared – has said it has been told by police that such action would be unlawful and could bring criminal prosecution and thousands of pounds in fines. The organisation is planning to hold the socially distanced event on Clapham Common, and at least nine others are planned in towns and cities such as Cambridge, Cardiff, Leeds, Liverpool and St Andrews.   Related: The Guardian view on violence against women: without safety, there can be no equality | Editorial   In a statement, Reclaim These Streets said: “Our plan was to hold a short gathering, centred around a minute of silence to remember Sarah Everard and all the women lost to violence.” However the group said the Metropolitan police had changed its stance, having initially been supportive. Its statement said: “The Metropolitan Police … stated that the vigil would be unlawful, that their ‘hands are tied’ by the Covid-19 regulations and that, as organisers, we could face tens of thousands of pounds in fixed penalty notices and criminal prosecution under the Serious Crimes Act.” The Met said in a statement late on Thursday: “We understand the public’s strength of feeling and are aware of the statement issued by Reclaim These Streets with regard to a planned vigil for Sarah Everard in Clapham Common this weekend. “We remain in discussion with the organisers about this event in light of the current Covid regulations.” Harriet Harman said she had written to the Met to back the event, adding: “Parliament has not specifically acted to constrain the right to demonstrate, so long as social distancing is observed this vigil will be perfectly lawful.” The Labour MP also said she planned to attend the one-hour vigil on Saturday, according to Reclaim These Streets. The organisation’s lawyers have written to the force challenging its interpretation of coronavirus legislation when taken together with the Human Rights Act. It reached its crowdfunding target of £30,000 to cover legal costs shortly before 10.30pm on Thursday, with donations continuing to pour in. In a statement, the group said: “Should the judge decide in our favour, the Clapham vigil will be allowed to go ahead. “Should the judge decide against us, we may be liable for the Metropolitan police’s costs of up to £30,000. “We will also be forced to cancel the vigil, and no women across England will be able to assemble to assert their rights. “If we win the judgment, the money raised will be donated to a women’s charity. “By forcing us to cancel the Reclaim These Streets vigil, the Metropolitan police will be silencing thousands of women like us who want to honour Sarah’s memory and stand up for our right to feel safe on our streets.”\\n',\n",

       "  'full_article': 'The O2 Arena will soon use a new breed of “vertical wind turbine” to generate its own clean electricity, after signing a deal with a startup firm that says its turbines will generate power even when the wind is not blowing. The London landmark once known as the Millennium Dome will begin by installing 10 of the 68cm (27in) vertical turbines. The breezy conditions at the site on the River Thames will help generate enough clean electricity to power 23 homes.  graphic showing how mini-turbine works  Although this is a small amount of the O2’s total energy consumption, the arena’s owner, AEG, expects to install more of the mini turbines across its stadiums worldwide. The new breed of turbine is said to be able to spin from even a gentle movement of air, or a passing car. Each unit is made from recycled plastic and weighs about 4kg (9lbs), but the design could be scaled up to help generate as much electricity as 20 sq metres of solar panels, according to its developer, Alpha 311. Lee Lacey, the facility director at the O2, said the arena had “been searching for a suitable wind-generated power source” to help cut its greenhouse gas emissions and reach its ambition to become a net zero carbon entertainment venue.  “The opportunity to provide a local on-site source of power generation is huge and we hope this trial provides the launchpad of many more installations, not only at the O2 and other AEG venues but across the Greenwich peninsula and throughout the UK,” she said. Alpha 311 turbines were originally designed to be larger, at just nearly 2 metes in length, and installed on infrastructure with a connection to the electricity grid, such as streetlights, to help to reduce costs. Installing the turbines on streetlights along motorways, for example, could generate eight times as much clean electricity as they are expected to produce at the O2 Arena. Motorways also offer the advantage of minimal installation time and no negative impact on the environment or local views, which can be a concern for traditional windfarms in some areas. Barry Thompson, the chief executive of Alpha 311, said the company was already in talks with international buyers. He said: “The Alpha 311 turbine was born in Britain with international aspirations, so it’s fitting that we’re working with the world’s most popular music, entertainment and leisure venue.”\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'Tim Berners-Lee says too many young people are excluded from web',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Too many young people around the world are excluded from accessing the web, and getting them online should be a priority for the post-Covid era, Tim Berners-Lee has said. In a letter published to mark the 32nd birthday of the web, its founder says the opportunity “to reimagine our world and create something better” in the aftermath of Covid-19 must be channelled to getting internet access to the third of people aged between 15 and 24 who are offline. “The influence of young people is felt across their communities and online networks,” Berners-Lee writes. “But today we’re seeing just a fraction of what’s possible. Because while we talk about a generation of ‘digital natives’, far too many young people remain excluded and unable to use the web to share their talents and ideas. “A third of young people have no internet access at all. Many more lack the data, devices and reliable connection they need to make the most of the web. In fact, only the top third of under-25s have a home internet connection, according to Unicef, leaving 2.2 billion young people without the stable access they need to learn online, which has helped so many others continue their education during the pandemic.” Even though young people are more likely than the typical global citizen to have internet access – roughly half the world is online, but the figure rises to 70% of people aged between 15 and 25 – Berners-Lee argues that aiming to connect every young person in the world to the web would reap dividends.  He also says doing so would be relatively cheap compared with the cost of many government programmes launched over the last 12 months. He estimates that an investment of $428bn (£307bn) over the next decade would provide everyone with a quality broadband connection. Rosemary Leith, who co-founded the Web Foundation with Berners-Lee, said access to the web should be a basic right for young people, similar to education. “If half a generation of young people are unable to use the tools to thrive in a digital world – to learn new skills, run businesses, build communities, participate in democratic debate – society as a whole will miss out on their talents, ideas and efforts,” she said. The need to bring young people online was demonstrated during the Covid pandemic, as countries around the world moved to remote learning by default. The UK government was accused of falling short on its promises to provide laptops to poorer pupils months into the national lockdown. “More than three-quarters of our year 10 pupils do not have access, regularly and consistently, to a device or the internet at home,” Steve Howell, the headteacher at the City of Birmingham school, said in June. “The most disadvantaged pupils are hardest hit with IT poverty, and the fact this has taken so long is really making things worse.”\\n',\n",

       "  'full_article': 'The media has failed to learn the lessons of Caroline Flack’s death and must take responsibility for coverage of public figures struggling with mental health problems, the presenter’s mother has said. Speaking before the release of a Channel 4 documentary that seeks to present a more nuanced portrait of her “lovely, ordinary” daughter, who took her own life in February last year, Christine Flack said she hoped the outlets that “wrote all the horrible things about Caroline” would “take away that before they print anything, at least find out if it’s true. It’s someone’s life, it’s someone’s child, it’s someone’s sister or brother.” She added: “I don’t think they’ve learned yet.”    Caroline Flack at school in the 1990s. Photograph: Flack family/Channel 4/PA   Christine said there was a risk that speaking out would “lead to a backlash”. “You are frightened to say anything, or even I shouldn’t say what I’m saying now,” she said. “But do you know, someone’s got to say something at some time and not be frightened … because of what the papers will do to you.” She pointed to her own experience when she had gone to her daughter’s home after the incident that led to Caroline’s arrest on charges of assaulting her boyfriend Lewis Burton, and before the Sun ran a front-page picture of Caroline’s bedroom on 1 January with the headline “Flack’s bedroom bloodbath”. The picture showed the result of Caroline’s self-harm rather than the incident with Burton. “They followed me and two other 70-year-olds across London one night after I cleaned up the blood in Carrie’s flat, that’s how bad they were,” Christine said. “No, they haven’t changed.”    Caroline Flack at the ITV Palooza! at the Royal Festival Hall, London in November 2019. Photograph: David Fisher/Rex/Shutterstock   She described the abrupt change in tone in some tabloids after her daughter’s death and as criticism of the media became part of the story – as well as allegations that the police and Crown Prosecution Service had mishandled the case, a claim that official reviews said were unfounded. “The same papers that wrote all the horrible things about Carrie, after she died got in contact with me to say, oh we’d love to do a lovely article about her. And you think: what? I don’t understand this.” The film, Caroline Flack: Her Life and Death, will be shown at 9pm on Wednesday 17 March. It comes a time of renewed scrutiny of how parts of the media cover mental health problems, and in particular the treatment of young women in the public eye. After the release of a US documentary exploring coverage of Britney Spears in the 2000s, the Duchess of Sussex’s comments in her interview with Oprah Winfrey prompted calls for greater care over the handling of the issue – alongside some responses casting Meghan as a liar. “You can see what’s going on now with certain people in the press,” Christine said at an event before the release of the Meghan and Harry interview. In the film, she said of her daughter: “She wasn’t perfect but she didn’t have any bad in her. I can’t imagine her writing a nasty thing about someone. And everything that was written about her hurt her. And we’d say ‘don’t read it’. But it’s so easy to say, because you do read it, don’t you?”    Christine Flack and Jody Flack in Caroline Flack: Her Life and Death’. Photograph: Bafta/Rex/Shutterstock   While Christine Flack and Caroline’s twin sister, Jody, were critical of media coverage, they also pointed to the dangers of social media for a vulnerable person in the public eye. “When I was young if you were bullied at school you could get away from it,” Christine said. “You can’t get away from it now because it follows you home, it follows you on your phone. Carrie was the worst one – she looked at her phone all the time. It took her over, what was being said. And there could be 30 nice things said, one bad thing said, and that was it.” She said of social media platforms: “They failed to protect anybody. I think we know it’s Caroline because she’s my daughter and Jo’s sister, but they don’t protect anyone. They don’t protect young girls.” She said she saw the events of Christmas 2019, and her relationship with Burton, as triggers of a wider crisis her daughter was facing prompted by low self-esteem and her high profile. “Carrie’s state of mind was such that any of those things could have done it,” she said. “She just hated the thought that people thought she was this awful person.” Jody said she “used to tell Carrie she should do a different job. But she always just proved me wrong. She was doing what she did best, and she loved it, and it was completely the wrong advice.” Her sister’s commitment to being a presenter meant her life was bound to be difficult, she said. “Life would have been a lot easier if she’d done a different job. But Carrie was never going to have an easy life. She wasn’t built to do that.” The hardest part of her death, she said, was wondering “could it have happened any differently if we’d done things differently?” She said: “It’s hard to imagine a closer bond than twins. It’s a different world now.” Anna Blue, a TV producer and close friend of Caroline’s, told the film-makers that the contradictions in her desire for fame were never reconciled. “Sometimes people ask if she wanted to be famous, which is a really good question,” she said. “And she did want to be famous, but she just wasn’t emotionally wired to deal with all the problems that came with being famous.”    Dermot O’Leary says Flack ‘didn’t have a bad bone in her’. Photograph: Bafta/Rex/Shutterstock   The presenter Dermot O’Leary, also a friend, said the feedback loop of her position in the public eye was part of the problem. “It was tough, it hurt – sadly as Caroline got more famous I think she became addicted to affirmation, and all that terrible maelstrom ended up with us on this sofa talking to you about her now,” he said. “She didn’t have a bad bone in her.” While making the documentary was painful at times, Christine said, the film-makers Charlie Russell and Dov Freedman had “made this year bearable, because it was someone we could talk to”. She said she wanted “to show Carrie in a positive light … What was shown at the end wasn’t her. She wasn’t perfect but that wasn’t her.” The version of Caroline she remembered, she said, was “this positive, nice person, and my daughter, and a sister, she never changed and she was good to us and lovely”. Anna Blue said her life had only been enriched by their relationship. “I just won’t ever forget that she made my life so much more fun than it ever would have been,” she said. “I’ve never met anyone like her. I’ll never meet anyone else like her.”  In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

       "  'full_article': 'On Friday 13 March 2020 as the Covid-19 crisis gripped, the sporting calendar collapsed. This is the story of that day, and what happened next, in the words of leading players and officials. Formula One teams gathered in Melbourne for the opening grand prix of the season. On Thursday 12 March, a member of the McLaren team tested positive for Covid-19. Lando Norris, McLaren driver: I remember heading to Australia, and at that point everything was pretty normal for us, although we were starting to see things about Covid on the news, such as Tom Hanks testing positive [in Australia]. On the Thursday we knew a member of the team had suspected symptoms and was being tested. I don’t know why, but even though we were going about our activities as normal, I did have a hunch that the race would be cancelled with things around the world getting worse, and that we wouldn’t be coming back to the track the next day. Going back to the hotel that night, I got a call from Andrea [Stella, the racing director], who gave me the news that McLaren were pulling out of the weekend because our team member had tested positive. It was the start of everything. Things went very quickly from a normal Thursday at the track to flying back home the next day.   Related: Not a sprint: endurance experts on how to make it through lockdown   Christian Horner, Red Bull team principal: On the way to Australia we knew Covid-19 was becoming a bigger global concern but we felt having left Europe we would at least get the season under way. Then very quickly things changed. None of us had experienced anything like that when the whole world came to a halt, we just wanted to get the team home safely and then things just got worse and worse as we went into the lockdown.

Photograph: Scott Barbour/AAP   On Thursday 12 March Arsenal’s head coach, Mikel Arteta, was diagnosed with coronavirus – the prelude to, and trigger for, much of the next day’s drama. Mark Gonnella, director of communications, Arsenal: We knew the implications would be far-reaching. I was aware he [Arteta] had gone home poorly and that we were awaiting the outcome of the test result. Our match at Manchester City the previous day had already been postponed and it felt as if we were at the epicentre of everything. It was late in the evening when Mikel’s diagnosis came through but we decided to make the announcement straight away, confirming too that our next game, at Brighton, would be off.

Photograph: Graham Hunt/ProSports/Rex/Shutterstock   Mark Catlin, Portsmouth chief executive: We had played Arsenal in the FA Cup fifth round the week before and I got a call out of courtesy from their CEO [Vinai Venkatesham] to say that it was going to break that Mikel Arteta had tested positive and to advise that we might want to get our players tested. And from that first round of testing we had five players return positive tests pretty soon after. It was just like a car going down a hill that you just couldn’t apply the brakes. It kicked up a momentum of its own, the picture was changing by the hour, and it was the beginning of the end in society as we knew it at the time. There was a Nottingham Forest game [against Millwall] that the Greek owner [Evangelos Marinakis] had attended in the Championship and his other club, Olympiakos, had had a few cases and then it suddenly became very real. We were due to play Accrington on the Saturday and their owner, Andy Holt, had expressed concern at how quickly the virus was spreading. We spoke to the EFL [English Football League] and said we were really nervous about the game taking place while we were waiting for results of our players being tested and over those few days it spiralled to the point where by that Saturday the whole of the EFL was suspended. It was just one of those surreal things you think is never going to happen.     The front of Guardian Sport’s print edition on 14 March 2020. Photograph: The  Guardian   Rick Parry, EFL chairman: The first thing that Friday [13 March] was an early morning call with the Premier League and FA where we agreed that we would take a common line. Then we called a board meeting, at extremely short notice, to focus on the single issue: do we play this weekend or not? The Premier League obviously had their concerns about Arteta. We had concerns about Nottingham Forest and Portsmouth in particular, and I think there was another club where positives were starting to appear. It was definitely a live issue. So although at that point the government guidance was that it was still safe, we decided it wasn’t. The decision to postpone was pretty quickly and unanimously reached. Gareth Davies, then chairman of the Welsh Rugby Union: We were at Twickenham the previous Saturday [for England v Wales]. The prime minister was there and everything was fine. At that stage people didn’t know the effect Covid-19 was going to have on us all. The first time it really registered was on the Monday. My daughter is a paediatric consultant and she said to me: “Dad, are you comfortable with the Scotland game going ahead on Saturday?” But the official advice we were receiving was that outdoor events were permitted, that even if there were mass gatherings outside you wouldn’t get infected. As a rugby board, who were we to go against that? By the Thursday, even so, I was getting twitchy. But other sporting events were still proceeding so I informed the government we were going ahead with the game. Then, on the Friday morning, I got up early to discover the Premier League had changed their minds. Apart from Cheltenham we were suddenly the last man standing. So I called another board meeting for midday, rang the first minister, Mark Drakeford, and said my recommendation would be that we pulled the game. He understood our position totally and was very understanding. Thank God we did call it off. Cheltenham have been crucified for carrying on, haven’t they?    Boris Johnson and his partner, Carrie Symonds, watch England v Wales at Twickenham on 7 March, six days before sport was halted. Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock   The Masters golf was postponed minutes before Wales v Scotland was. Ian Poulter, golfer: I had gotten off to a decent start at the Players Championship [in Florida]. I shot 70 on the Thursday and was looking forward to a good weekend. Whispers started on that Thursday evening about cancellation then we got given the news later that night. You were confused, didn’t know how serious it was and what it meant for any of us. How much time was this really going to take out? The rest of that weekend is pretty blurred. Joe Denly, England and Kent batsman: England were playing a four-day warm-up match in Sri Lanka and I remember fielding on the boundary, thinking to myself: “What am I doing here? I need to get home.” We didn’t really understand the virus at the time. As soon as you hear that people have died – and each passing hour the severity of it seemed to increase – all you can think about is getting back to your loved ones in case the worst happened. Being part of a Test tour for your country, you are living your dream. And so the fact I didn’t want to be there told me something wasn’t right. Joe Root went off the field for talks with senior officials and, when he returned to say a decision had been made, it was a relief. The way the team doctor, Gurjit Bhogal, and the entire England support staff dealt with it during the days leading up to the call was first-class.     Joe Root leads his team from the field after the tour match between Sri Lankan Cricket Board President’s XI and England was abandoned. Photograph: Gareth Copley/Getty Images   Hugh Brasher, London Marathon event director: 29 February was when it really hit me that the marathon was in trouble. I was sitting in the Tower hotel on the eve of the London Big Half when suddenly the Paris half marathon was called off at 12 hours’ notice. I remember thinking: “Woah, this is major.” It snowballed quickly after that. Within days it was clear that the London Marathon was increasingly unlikely to be held on its traditional April date because of Covid-19, and so behind the scenes we rushed to get approval from the mayor, Transport for London and the boroughs to move the race to October. Thankfully they were all incredibly understanding. On 13 March we broke the news to the world.    Participants in the Big Half in London went ahead on 1 March while the Paris half marathon was cancelled. Photograph: Laura De Meo/Rex/Shutterstock   While other sports postponed, the Cheltenham festival completed its final day, including its standout race, the Gold Cup. On Tuesday 17 March racing was suspended. Dr Jerry Hill, chief medical adviser, British Horseracing Authority: I was at the festival for a couple of days and at that time I was still working for the Football Association. On the last day of the festival, I had to go up to St George’s Park to look after an England squad there, and I remember being on the training pitch when we got the call from Uefa to say that competitions had been cancelled. I had a conversation shortly afterwards with Dr Iain McNeil, the Racecourse Association’s medical adviser, and we almost said simultaneously: “We’re going to have to advise to suspend racing.” Then there were very difficult conversations with stakeholders to get them to understand the importance of this, and what was coming over the horizon. After that, it’s been absolutely relentless for a year.    The opening race of day four of the Cheltenham Festival on Friday 13 March 2020, which went ahead as sport elsewhere ground to a halt. Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian   Gareth Davies: While we were conscious it would be a big hit financially – around £10m – our discussions weren’t based on finance. It was simply about reaching the correct decision. Everyone criticises politicians but they have to deal with things like this 365 days a year.  On 9 March, the BNP Paribas Open tennis tournament in Indian Wells became the first major professional sports event in the US to be cancelled. With the Miami Open scheduled two weeks later, some European players remained in the US before rushing to get out of the country when Donald Trump suspended travel from Europe on 12 March. Garbiñe Muguruza, tennis player: I was in shock. My whole team was in shock. We were kind of laughing because we said: “Oh man, we’re here in Indian Wells, it’s a tournament that we all love. OK, let’s take a break and let’s see each other in a couple of weeks.” And six months later, everybody was in their own country and couldn’t get to each other. “See you in a few weeks” became six months.     Johanna Konta takes on Coco Gauff in an empty Roland Garros at the French Open, which was put back until the autumn. Photograph: Christian Hartmann/Reuters   Coco Gauff, tennis player: Actually, I liked it at first just to have time home. And then I remember the last month or so I was anxious to play – practising and staying motivated was just a little bit tough because you set goals for yourself and that’s how you stay motivated. But there were no goals to look forward to so it was hard to stay motivated. Dominic Thiem, tennis player:  In the beginning, well, I thought that the tour is going to be back in two or three weeks and everything is going to be normal again. But slowly, of course, me and also everybody else realised that it’s a serious, dangerous thing going on and that there is going to be a longer break.

I think my experience of the pandemic would have been very different if I’d stayed in my sweaty hot apartment in France for the entirety of lockdown. I was injured at the time and wondering which team I was going to be at next season [Bronze moved to Manchester City in September], so there were a lot of things going through my head. My focus was all over the place at that point to be honest. I felt the stress of the situation really highly.  Christian Horner: I am proud of how we responded. Very quickly the team and F1 applied itself to the challenge of building ventilators to battle Covid. We had a group of engineers that turned around in three weeks what would usually take three years to get an up-and-running prototype ventilator in collaboration with other UK-based F1 teams.     The breathing aid developed in less than a week by mechanical engineers, doctors and the Mercedes F1 team.

It was weird, it was the longest period of time that I’d not been in a race car or doing any kind of driving on track since I was seven years old. Mentally I felt OK, as I don’t mind spending time on my own and could still do things I liked. It was more the periods of time when you were able to go outside and see your mates as things opened up a little that were more challenging for me, since I couldn’t risk anything so didn’t go out to see anyone. I felt like I was missing out on feeling “normal”, which was tough. I couldn’t see my parents or friends in person for quite a while, but it never got to a really bad point. Ian Poulter: I had the opportunity to have pure family time. That sounds extremely selfish but I enjoyed that break. I’ve been a pro for 22 years and never had that time at home simply because of my job. In some respects, it was the most wonderful five months I’ll ever have with my family. Horse racing returned in the UK on 1 June. F1 hosted its first race in Austria on 5 July. Jerry Hill: The thing that’s really got us through this is working together as a sport. I think if we’re going to take something positive out of this very, very difficult year, it’s that. Christian Horner: Once we were racing everyone dealt with the new reality incredibly well. You had to roll with the punches and take on the challenge. There was the constant testing, the occasional positive case, team members were away from home, they were locked in hotel rooms in the evenings, it was tough conditions, we did three triple headers in a row. It was a brutal schedule, but there were no complaints, everybody just got on with it for the good of the sport. The fact that we did manage to fit in 17 races effectively between lockdowns was a great achievement by the whole sport.   Sign up for the Recap.  Golf restarted in June, cricket in July, rugby and tennis in August. Joe Denly: When cricket eventually resumed in the bubble I found it tough at first. I missed the buzz from the crowds and not being a golfer, or into computer games, it wasn’t easy to switch off on days off. Not being allowed to shower in the dressing room after a long day in the field wasn’t great, either. With England we were staying on site, at least, but back at Kent it was a case of jumping in the car for a disgusting drive home!

A year of understanding so many new things; face masks, having sand sanitiser in your car, different states with different rules. Then when it means from a global golfer’s perspective. I feel like I’m still in a bit of a whirlwind because I’ve played so few events. Gareth Davies: For rugby the next few years are going to be tough. It’s going to be an ongoing challenge for every union worldwide. The only slightly disappointing thing for me is that it’s presented an opportunity to get a lot of other things together, such as a global season, and I’m not sure we’ve taken full advantage of that. Hugh Brasher: I’m proud of what we did next. Within 22 days we went from conception to delivery of the 2.6 mile challenge – on the date where the London marathon would have been held – which raised £11.5m for charity. We then had another setback when October’s mass participation race was called off, but we were able to announce an elite race behind closed doors and a “virtual” London marathon across the globe that attracted nearly 38,000 runners worldwide.

Lucy Bronze: There’s that old saying, we say it a lot in football, we always say it at England camps, that you can only control the controllables. A game might get cancelled, or my house might have been delayed or something else, but I can just control what I can control. I can imagine there are people in the world that are a lot worse off, too, and so I’ve just tried to stay as positive as possible about the situation that I’m in. I’m very fortunate to be a professional football player and to still go to work, even in these times, to do the thing that I love. Not many people can say that at the minute.

We have played 41 competitive games since mid-September and it puts an additional strain on people. Winning the FA Cup was a real boost for everyone, even if we all felt the absence of fans at Wembley and the traditional parade through Islington. It was also a special moment to welcome 2,000 of our home supporters back for two games in December. If it needed reinforcing, those nights emphasised that the fans are fundamental to everything we do.

Despite discussions with government and authorities about neutral grounds we always thought the best approach was to play on home territory. Who would know better how to keep the ground secure and sterile than the club that owned it? Others were taking different views but we stuck to our principles on that. When you live through the ultimate challenges it’s day by day. The credit has to go to the clubs. They’re the ones that made it happen, they’re the ones who rallied round.

       "  'full_article': \"1) Fulham have reasons for optimism as City visit After two wins in their first 22 games of the season it’s three in six now for Fulham, the fifth best record in the division over that period. Brighton were 10 points away after Fulham’s draw with West Ham last month; now the teams are separated only by goal difference, with Newcastle and Burnley not much more distant. After this match, seven of Fulham’s last nine games are against teams no higher than ninth; their last two home games are against Burnley and Newcastle. In short, there are plenty of reasons for optimism for Scott Parker and his side, and there’s not much Manchester City can do to change that. Fulham will do well to emerge from this game with a goal difference still superior to those of most of their relegation rivals, but are aiming higher. “United beat them, so why can’t we do it?” says Joachim Andersen. The teams’ last six meeting in all competitions add up to an entirely unpromising aggregate score of 18-0 to City. SB  Fulham v Manchester City (Saturday, 8pm, all times GMT)    Related: The unlikely story of how 'Dundee United' became an insult in Nigeria   2) Pulisic still waiting for his turn under Tuchel Since Thomas Tuchel was appointed in January, Christian Pulisic has not played more than 45 minutes in a Premier League game. That may be terribly dispiriting for a young forward who at times has been integral to this team, but it might also allow the American to approach the end of the campaign with motivation high and tiredness low. At the same stage last season he was coming to the end of a long absence through injury and lockdown, andreturned for the final nine league games, scoring four goals and creating four more, his best run of form for Chelsea. Whether Tuchel will allow him the chance at a similar burst of form is another matter. “I can say nothing but good things about him,” said Tuchel this week. “It isn’t a lack of trust or quality, it is just that he will have to be patient.” SB  Leeds United v Chelsea (Saturday, 12.30pm)     Christian Pulisic has been largely restricted to substitute appearances under Thomas Tuchel. Photograph: Dave Shopland/IPS/Shutterstock   3) Derby day will offer measure of Arsenal progress It wasn’t so long ago that Sam Allardyce took over at West Brom and declared the Baggies would be scrapping with Arsenal in a relegation dogfight. Results for Mikel Arteta’s men have been somewhat mixed since then, but good enough to vault them into the top half. Defeat Spurs and they would draw to within two points of Liverpool, who meet Wolves on Monday, and four behind Tottenham. With fixtures against West Ham and the defending champions also looming, Arteta has a perfect opportunity to demonstrate his claim that the Gunners’ league position belies the progress they are making. José Mourinho’s men have been gathering a momentum of their own just lately and if Gareth Bale’s revival continues, it would be no surprise to see Tottenham’s attacking firepower win the day. LM  Arsenal v Tottenham (Sunday, 4.30pm)      4) Phillips and Kabak offer Klopp some stability With Monday’s trip to Molineux a welcome trip away from Liverpool’s historic Anfield hoodoo, Jürgen Klopp will hope for a continuation of the improvements seen in Budapest during the “home” Champions League defeat of RB Leipzig. Nat Phillips received plaudits for his performance in the centre of defence alongside Ozan Kabak, the Schalke loanee far more comfortable against Bundesliga opposition than he has been in the Premier League. Fabinho starting in midfield for the first time in months certainly aided the youthful pair, as well as the overall balance of the team. Phillips was noticeably more decisive and assured than in that latest home defeat to Fulham last Sunday; Wednesday was perhaps the most confident Liverpool have looked defensively since Virgil van Dijk’s injury. After 20 different defensive pairings this season, against a Wolves attack struggling for goals, Klopp is likely to plump for continuity and giving the fledgling partnership a run together. JB  Wolves v Liverpool (Monday, 8pm)     Nathaniel Phillips and Ozan Kabak celebrate a win and a clean sheet against Leipzig. Photograph: Attila Kisbenedek/AFP/Getty Images   5) Three or four at the back for Ancelotti? Everton have switched between a back three and four this season with varying results, though the four has been Carlo Ancelotti’s more successful and frequent selection. But he has so far started both his games against Sean Dyche’s Burnley with three centre-backs, beginning with his first game as Everton manager in December 2019 and continuing when the teams met last December. On that occasion, however, a first-half injury to left wing-back Fabian Delph forced him to change shape, the team looked much better after their reorganisation (with Alex Iwobi as a makeshift right-back) and they did not change back again for more than two months. Recently Everton have beaten Liverpool and lost to Chelsea with three at the back, while beating Southampton and West Brom with four. It will be interesting to see which way Ancelotti goes here, though the return of Séamus Coleman should at least spare Iwobi further full-back action. SB  Everton v Burnley (Saturday, 5.30pm)  6) Moyes can walk tall again at Old Trafford Almost seven years on from his sacking by Manchester United, David Moyes travels back to Old Trafford with his West Ham team in fifth place and his reputation replenished. Moyes has not beaten United since he was Everton’s manager, on the opening weekend of the 2012-13 season. He has faced them seven times since, drawing twice with West Ham; this may be his best chance yet to get a win. In east London, Moyes has shown why he was Sir Alex Ferguson’s chosen successor by producing a hard-working team greater than the sum of their parts. He has aided Declan Rice’s development into one of the best midfielders in the country while Craig Dawson, a 30-year-old centre-back surplus to requirements at West Brom, has reminded of Moyes’ ability to polish unlikely diamonds. Those traumatic nine months at United can never be wiped away but Moyes is again showing there was always a good manager within him. JB  Manchester United v West Ham (Sunday 7.15pm)     David Moyes has West Ham bubbling under in the Champions League race. Photograph: Andy Rain/AP   7) Newcastle and Villa in Friday night flop? Newcastle will once again be without Callum Wilson, Allan Saint-Maximin and Miguel Almirón for the visit of Aston Villa. Particularly worrying given that they were able to call upon all three for their trip to Villa Park in January (though Saint-Maximin started on the bench) yet still had only one shot on target. Almirón’s effort was, according to our match report, “a piffling effort from 20 yards that barely made Martínez move enough to get warm”. Against West Brom, Steve Bruce played Joelinton and Ryan Fraser as a very distant front two, who rarely threatened in a miserable game. If their primary intention then was, perhaps understandably, to avoid defeat, Bruceneeds a significant improvement against a Villa side with their own issues up front – they have scored two in their last five games. Their creator-in-chief, Jack Grealish, remains injured and has also been battling illness this week, according to the Villa manager, Dean Smith.

Take a deep dive into their clean sheets   8) Blades offer test of Leicester’s top-four mettle While Sheffield United are playing for pride at this stage by Chris Wilder’s own admission, Leicester have plenty to fight for in the league and FA Cup. This is a campaign that could still go either way for Brendan Rodgers’ men: should they exit the Cup in their quarter-final against Manchester United a week on Sunday, soon after departing the Europa League, that would leave only a top-four finish to play for. Thomas Tuchel’s Chelsea are breathing down their necks, looking increasingly likely to finish strongly, so the next few weeks will be a test of Rodgers’ managerial skills as well as the character of his injury-hit squad. Another late-season slump in the Premier League would be dispiriting, and in view of the form being shown by Tuchel’s men, West Ham and others, the Foxes cannot realistically afford to pass up the chance of three points against the league’s bottom club. LM  Leicester v Sheffield United (Sunday 2pm)     Daniel Amartey (left) scores the winner for Leicester at Brighton, a goal that could prove pivotal for both sides. Photograph: Neil Hall/PA   9) Brighton will hope for Saints slips in derby Two south coast clubs, two teams badly out of form. Southampton followed up Saturday’s precious win at rock-bottom Sheffield United with a midweek thrashing at Manchester City. They did not play too badly but every defensive mistake was punished. Only the hapless Blades have picked up fewer points in the last five games than Brighton, and their slide down towards the bottom three owes plenty to individual mistakes. Leicester’s win at the Amex last week came after Robert Sánchez’s goalkeeping error presented Daniel Amartey with a tap-in. That Graham Potter’s team had nothing to show for what had been a decent performance has become one of the most common refrains of this season. There is little doubt that Brighton are now in danger, sitting level on points with Fulham with a game in hand. On Sunday, Potter may have to hope Southampton make more mistakes. JB  Southampton v Brighton (Sunday, 12pm)    Sign up for The Fiver.  10) Palace seek Zaha bounce against Baggies When Crystal Palace and West Brom met in December, Roy Hodgson’s side scored as many goals (five) as they have had shots on target in their last four matches combined. At the end of that game, Wilfried Zaha had scored seven goals in his nine league appearances, and 32% of his shots had gone in. “What he has added to his game this year is goalscoring,” Roy Hodgson said after the game. “If Wilf can keep that up it bodes very well for us.” He has not: there have been two goals in 11 games since, in which time just 9% of his shots have gone in. Still, he remains of fundamental importance to Palace and will surely return to their starting lineup for this game, after coming back from a thigh strain to play the second half of last weekend’s 4-1 defeat at Tottenham.

       "  'full_article': 'Football Index, the self-styled “football stock market”, appeared to be heading into administration on Thursday evening, five days after a massive crash on its market that left its customers with tens of millions of pounds trapped in its platform. If the business collapses, it will be the biggest failure of any British betting company, possibly leaving individual customers facing potential losses of £200,000 or more. A statement posted on the Football Index website on Thursday evening said that “after a difficult and challenging week” for its users, a decision had been taken “to suspend the platform”.   Related: Anger grows as Football Index issued new shares in players days before major changes   The statement continued: “We are pursuing a restructuring arrangement to be agreed with our stakeholders including, most importantly, our community. We are preparing this through an administration with insolvency practitioners Begbies Traynor, to seek the best outcome for customers with the goal of continuing the platform in a restructured form.” Football Index launched in 2015, selling what it described as “shares” in leading footballers and paying “dividends” to users according to a player’s performance on the pitch. Its model required customers to deposit and spend significant amounts of money on shares in order to receive dividends over a three-year period, and some users are believed to have made six-figure deposits on the site. At one point last year, a share in Jadon Sancho, the most popular player on the site with nearly a million shares in circulation, was priced at £15. Prior to the suspension of the platform on Thursday evening, Sancho’s “buy” price had dropped to less than £1. From its launch, there was scepticism in some areas of the gambling industry about the long-term prospects of Football Index, including comparisons with Ponzi or pyramid schemes, which depend on revenue from new customers to pay dividends owed to others further up the pyramid. When a Ponzi runs out of new users, a collapse is inevitable, leaving existing users unable to retrieve their funds.   Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors’ picks.  Many customers of Football Index will have been fearing Thursday’s news since the latest, and most spectacular, of several crashes on its market since September 2020. Football Index is a betting firm, regulated by the Gambling Commission. But its website and business model mirrored a market-making platform for derivatives trading, and one of many questions that will need to be answered if or when the platform folds is why the Gambling Commission, and not the Financial Conduct Authority, was the regulator responsible for overseeing its operation.\\n',\n",

A statement from the governing body, that also oversees the Team GB setup, said: “We apologise to the players and clubs concerned, and will also do so personally. The timing of the correspondence was an error but we take full responsibility for the upset this has caused.”   Related: Manchester City Women thrash Fiorentina to reach quarter-finals   After Everton’s 4-0 Women’s Super League victory over Birmingham at St George’s Park Carla Ward, the Birmingham manager, criticised the decision and said it had made her reconsider starting first-choice goalkeeper Hampton.

We’re wondering whether to even play her. The timing was absolutely ridiculous. We had a kid, a 20-year-old kid, in floods of tears, and you can see that it’s clearly affected her out there tonight and I think the timing of it is thoughtless.” Imagining the best-case scenario, that the governing body had innocently forgotten the match was taking place, Ward added: “You’re not going to get it happening before Champions League days or ties for a Man City, but it’s OK to deliver news to players from both sides an hour before kick-off, when it’s Everton v Birmingham.” Willie Kirk, Everton’s manager, was also critical of the timing, after two of his players were informed they were also not on the shortlist and two were told they were.

       "  'full_article': 'An unprecedented study into the wellbeing of British children is to be conducted across Manchester’s schools, as new research suggests two-thirds of parents believe it should be prioritised over academic attainment. The Greater Manchester young people’s wellbeing programme will gather data from tens of thousands of young people across 250 secondary schools in the city in an attempt to change their perception as “people who get GCSE results”, according to the programme’s creator. The first study of its kind in the country, the wellbeing programme will begin this autumn and will seek to ascertain young people’s feelings and concerns as well as their levels of physical activity. The information gathered will be used to help better target resources as children try to recover from the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. Research is to be conducted by the University of Manchester in association with the Anna Freud Centre, the Youth Sports Trust and the Greater Manchester combined authority. It is an idea conceived by the philanthropist David Gregson, who argues that the UK has neglected the wellbeing and physical health of children in favour of academic attainment, to the detriment of their development. A new YouGov survey commissioned by the Youth Sports Trust suggested parents across the country would be sympathetic to such arguments. The survey found that 65% of parents believed wellbeing was a key factor in choosing a child’s secondary school, while only 48% said the same of exam results. Meanwhile, 70% of parents with children between the ages of 11 and 16 said their children’s wellbeing had suffered during the pandemic. “I first took this idea to Greater Manchester in 2019 and all Covid has done, as the tide has gone out, is expose the pebbles we knew existed,” Gregson said. “For me, our education system has become too focused on attainment. A necessary but insufficient assessment. “We’ve got ourselves into the position where we think that attainment is the be-all and end-all and I don’t agree with that. I want to change that dialogue and I want to improve the wellbeing of young people in Greater Manchester to prove that point.” Gregson says information collated by the programme will quickly be shared with local authorities in order to recognise areas of need, specifically with regards to physical activity, which is proven to improve wellbeing. “My 10-year plan is to add a second leg to the assessment of young people in Britain that we don’t just think of them as people who get GCSE results,” Gregson said. “That we think about another equally important part of their makeup, which is their wellbeing, their sense of self-esteem, their sense of optimism. We’ll need all of that. We needed it pre-Covid and we’ll certainly need it after Covid.”\\n',\n",

       "  'full_article': \"Risk and reward sit either side of the thinnest divide. As the minutes ticked down this began to feel like another addition, perhaps the most critical one, to the case that Arsenal are not quite ready to succeed with the playing style Mikel Arteta desires. They had been superior to Olympiakos in every department bar the part of one’s brain that dictates when, and how, to weave intricate passing moves from the back. When Youssef El-Arabi finally punished them with an equaliser shortly before the hour, raising the spectre of last season’s second-leg heist, there was an obvious danger they had been too clever for their own good.   Related: Manchester United denied win against Milan by Simon Kjær's late equaliser   Every Europa League tie carries a profound sense of jeopardy for Arsenal given their domestic toils. They eventually pulled clear in this one and earned the convincing win that, repeat offences to one side, their fluent performance merited. This is a better team than the one that nosedived against the same opponents in February 2020: here they could prove it via a bravura header from Gabriel and a long-range blast from the substitute Mohamed Elneny. It should be enough to avert disaster at the Emirates next Thursday. “I’m really pleased with the result, with the goals we scored and the way we played in big moments,” Arteta said. “But as well we have to be very honest with ourselves that we gave three [chances] to our opponents and they scored one. To go to the next level we have to be more ruthless and kill games.” Arsenal had deservedly led through a 34th-minute thunderbolt by Martin Ødegaard, who had missed a presentable early chance but put his left foot through the ball from 25 yards and sent a ripping strike past José Sá. It flew straight down the middle but the home keeper was beaten by the sheer force. There was little doubt the visitors had more goals in them: Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang had already been thwarted when Sá brilliantly pawed his deflected header on to the bar and Olympiakos looked ragged under examination.    Martin Ødegaard (right) opens the scoring for Arsenal. Photograph: Thanassis Stavrakis/AP   On Saturday, Burnley had not looked much sturdier before Granit Xhaka handed them parity on a plate. Arteta wants Arsenal to play out from defence but, as he accepted in what was at times a carbon copy of the weekend’s post-match inquest, they are yet to perfect their decision making. No pennies had dropped between the two games: a loose pass from Ødegaard before his opener saw Bruma squander Olympiakos’s first opportunity with a tame shot at Bernd Leno. As half-time neared, David Luiz presented the ball to Giorgos Masouras deep inside Arsenal’s area and was fortunate to see the winger balloon horribly wide.   Related: Harry Kane doubles up to sink Dinamo Zagreb and put Spurs in driving seat   If it is careless to err twice, how does one describe the third time? Dani Ceballos had just replaced the excellent Thomas Partey when he received a short pass from Leno, who had clear options to his right but played him horribly into trouble. An alert El-Arabi pickpocketed him and, with Leno backtracking fruitlessly, curled the ball into the bottom corner from 20 yards. El-Arabi, who jabbed in the dramatic late winner last time around, would have compounded matters if Héctor Bellerín had not bravely deflected another shot just wide. Arsenal took charge again, though, and the quality of their goals was unimpeachable. Gabriel bullied the stand-in centre-back Yann M’Vila when Willian hung in a deep cross and, via a tremendous run and leap, arced in an unstoppable finish. Then Elneny, who had recently come on, took aim from distance as space opened up in midfield and found the corner via Sá’s left hand. “He’s been training so hard to improve his shooting range,” Arteta said.   The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.  Perhaps it is all part of the equation: maybe Arsenal will reach the point where conceding maddening goals becomes irrelevant as the bulk of quality at the other end holds sway. But that looks some way off and Arteta agreed people could fairly say Arsenal are their own worst enemy. “They’re not far off,” he said. “The goals and chances we have conceded are coming from ourselves. The reality is we have to stop it immediately.” They will probably get away with it in a week’s time, but their season depends on it.\\n\",\n",

The return amounts to a single League Cup. José Mourinho considers trophies as the “salt and pepper of football,” the essential seasoning, and so has Levy’s reign been bland? Hardly. Yet how everybody connected to the club craves something this season, very possibly in the Europa League.   Related: Manchester United denied win against Milan by Simon Kjær's late equaliser   Against the 21-times champions of Croatia, Spurs took another step towards the dream. It has been a gruelling campaign and this was game No 45 for Mourinho and his players but they proved too strong for Dinamo Zagreb, moving to within touching distance of the quarter-finals. Harry Kane was pictured with an ice pack on his knee after his 84th-minute substitution but it was merely precautionary. He will surely be fit for Sunday’s derby at Arsenal, according to Mourinho. Kane could reflect, instead, on a decisive two-goal contribution that drove a fifth win on the spin in all competitions for his team and prompted the Dinamo manager, Zoran Mamic, to salute him as a “master of football.” “Harry is that because he is very intelligent,” Mourinho said. “He scores goals but, as well as that, he understands every tip we give him in terms of his positioning and movement.

Dinamo, who dropped down from the Champions League qualifying rounds last September, brought form in the shape of eight straight wins in all competitions and their technique and intensity was on show at the outset. The evening could conceivably have followed a different course had Mislav Orsic, the Dinamo danger man, shot more cleanly after being inadvertently set through by Tanguy Ndombele’s loose back pass inside the first minute. Davinson Sánchez gave chase but Orsic had a good look at Hugo Lloris’s goal. The finish was weak.   Related: Filip Helander’s away goal heartens Rangers after slow start at Slavia Prague   Spurs stabilised after a sloppy start, with Erik Lamela central to asserting them as a physical force. It was not an evening when they could simply weave their patterns; Dinamo were too aggressive for that. Lamela fought fire with fire; putting his foot in, hustling. There was also skill and directness from him. He had almost teed up Kane with a ball over the top and he set up the breakthrough goal. Lamela was too strong for Lovro Majer in a 50-50 challenge and, when he spun away with the ball, his only thought was to run at the edge of the area. He swerved from left to right, moving away from Rasmus Lauritsen and throwing Kevin Theophile-Catherine before flicking a shot with the outside of his boot that came back off the inside of the post. Kane was on hand to roll the rebound into the empty net.    Harry Kane celebrates after opening the scoring for Tottenham against Dinamo Zagreb. Photograph: Alastair Grant/AP   Spurs worked a few promising openings before the interval, leading to crosses from Serge Aurier and Ben Davies only for nothing to come of them, but they were on top, with Dinamo forced back into their defensive block. The visitors’ plan was to punch on the counter; Spurs dealt with their threat with a degree of comfort.   Related: Ødegaard and Elneny set up Arsenal’s Europa League victory at Olympiakos   There was controversy early in the second half when Ndombele threw a stepover inside the area to panic Majer, who lunged at him. The Dinamo midfielder jammed his boot against Ndombele’s ankle, with no contact on the ball, before rather bundling into him. When Ndombele went down, it looked like a penalty. To Mourinho’s fury, the referee, Serdar Gozubuyuk, and his video assistant saw it differently. Spurs advertised a second goal, with Kane volleying a Son Heung-min cross towards Dele Alli only for Dinamo to clear and they got it when Theophile-Catherine miskicked an Aurier cross to Kane. Bad idea. Kane took one touch to kill the ball, another to roll it right to nick the space from Theophile-Catherine and a final one to ram home a low finish. Gareth Bale, on as a sub, almost got on to a cross from another replacement, Steven Bergwijn, while Carlos Vinícius, who replaced Kane, shot straight at the goalkeeper, Dominik Livakovic. “A third goal would have fitted the reality of the game very well,” Mourinho said. “But as it is, we did not kill the tie so it’s still open.\\n\",\n",

       "  'title': 'Max Malins handed a belated chance to shine for England in Six Nations',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Picking England’s rugby team is never an exact science and, latterly, Eddie Jones’s alchemist’s touch has deserted him. Too often he has either opted to stick with out-of-form regulars for slightly too long or not picked younger players when the opportunity has arisen. Giving a start to Max Malins at full-back should have happened at least a month ago, if not longer. With the championship already beyond their grasp it could be argued a lack of selectorial nettle-grasping, as much as anything, has been at the root of England’s winter problems. Nothing against Elliot Daly, who has enjoyed some great moments with both England and the British & Irish Lions, but why Malins did not wear the 15 jersey against Italy last month remains one of life’s minor mysteries.   Related: Max Malins makes first start for England in Six Nations clash with France   At least now, belatedly, there are signs of the spring clean that England’s starting XV has been needing for a while. Assuming, that is, that the 24-year-old Malins is given more chance to establish himself than was granted to Worcester’s Ollie Lawrence, unceremoniously dropped after barely touching the ball against Scotland and only now back involved among the replacements. Based on the form he has shown on loan at Bristol this season and the glimpses of potential off the bench, English supporters should be genuinely excited about the “Max factor” that could conceivably lend some gloss to the home backline against France. For some reason Jones took against Alex Goode when the latter was playing as well as any other full-back in the country; now he has a younger model with a similar vision for the game who has already been compared by Saracens’ director of rugby in stylistic terms to Beauden Barrett. Given Malins has grown up in the Sarries system he is also familiar with the importance of a decent kicking game and his national skipper Owen Farrell has seen enough to suspect the younger man has what it takes to prosper at the highest level: “Max is a dangerous full-back. He makes things happen, he beats people. He’s quick and strong and he’s also got a great instinct about the game which is a brilliant quality to have.” The only snag, as Northampton’s George Furbank can testify, is that making an instant impact at full-back against this fast-improving French side remains easier said than done. England did show a touch more attacking rhythm against Wales in Cardiff but so far in this tournament their pack has found it difficult to establish a consistent platform. Jamie George and Jonny Hill have paid the price on this occasion, with Luke Cowan-Dickie and Charlie Ewels promoted to add front-row energy and lineout savvy respectively. Cowan-Dickie is about to win his 30th cap for England but will be making just his fifth start; try persuading the Exeter hooker there is not much difference between wearing the No 2 or No 16 jerseys. A big day also looms for Ewels’s Bath teammate AnthonyWatson who has overcome more than his fair share of dark injury days to reach his 50th cap. “I’ve never seen a player work so hard,” noted Jones approvingly. “I think his 50th game will be his best game.”   The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.  It may have to be given some of the undoubted quality returning to France’s backline. An unbeaten Les Bleus side welcome back one of the world’s best centres in Virimi Vakatawa, with Toulouse’s Romain Ntamack also back from injury on the bench and the 30-year-old Toulon lock Romain Taofifenua deputising for the unavailable Bernard Le Roux. A 6:2 bench split would suggest a desire to prevent a physical drop-off in the final quarter and memories of their unfortunate extra-time defeat in December’s Autumn Nations Cup final have not yet entirely faded. There is also the possibility of a first grand slam in 11 years if France can conquer Twickenham in the Six Nations for the first time since 2005 before their concluding home games against Wales and Scotland. Tournament officials say the France v Scotland fixture, postponed from the championship’s middle weekend after a Covid outbreak in the French camp, will definitely be played on the evening of Friday 26 March but an official announcement has yet to be made.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'Eddie Jones trains England on reacting better to suspect refereeing decisions',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Eddie Jones has been drilling England on how to react to dodgy refereeing decisions as they seek to exorcise their discipline demons against France on Saturday. In an effort to improve his side’s ability to think on their feet and avoid the red mist against Les Bleus, Jones has been putting his players under the pump by rehearsing a number of “unfair” match scenarios – including bad calls from officials – in training. Jones, who has handed a first Test start to Max Malins with Elliot Daly dropping to the bench, has sought to address England’s high penalty count by bringing the referees Wayne Barnes and Matt Carley into training this week as he looks to avoid a third defeat in four Six Nations matches. On Thursday Jones also revealed how he has been stress-testing his players in a move that echoes Sir Clive Woodward’s “T-Cup” mantra of Thinking Correctly Under Pressure.   Related: Max Malins makes first start for England in Six Nations clash with France   England came unstuck against Wales last time out by conceding penalties in costly clusters, on top of two controversial tries, which the referee Pascal Gaüzère has since admitted he should have disallowed. For the first of those, Gaüzère instructed Owen Farrell to address his teammates about their penalty count, only for Dan Biggar to kick a penalty across the field for Josh Adams to score. Farrell was incensed but Gaüzère gave his protestations short shrift and the England captain was unable to improve his side’s discipline thereafter. Jones has admitted his players had been “trying too hard” when giving away needless penalties and wants them to improve on how they deal with their disappointment during the match. Citing France’s knack of forcing their opponents to infringe, Jones said: “We have tried to create training sessions this week particularly to replicate what might be termed as a disappointment in the game to make sure that we don’t lose our focus. Because what happens when you are not at your best is when you get those disappointing moments in the game, all other ideas start flooding into your head instead of just getting back to what is really important. “So particularly this week we have tried to create sessions that have elicited that response and again just tried to expose the players so they can practise that a bit more. [It is] game scenarios … a bad call by the referee, unfair conditions in the game … we have concentrated on a number of areas to put the players under pressure. There are going to be moments in the game when they are going to be tested like that.”   The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.  Farrell’s leadership has come under increased scrutiny throughout the tournament and his reaction to Wales’s first try only added to the suspicion his communication with referees needs improvement. Accordingly, Farrell has been picking the brains of Carley this week. “I spoke to Matt for a bit about it,” he said. “But there’s not too much you can do by way of getting that reversed. You never really change a referee’s decision. You try to have a dialogue to understand things and see how you can do things better, but we’re not really a part of the decision. I don’t think I dwell on [the scrutiny]. You soon come to realise what’s important and how you learn from things and take them going forward.” Meanwhile, France’s head coach Fabien Galthié has accepted the criticism coming his side’s way after a Covid-19 outbreak in the camp led to their last match against Scotland being postponed, but insisted “zero risk does not exist”. Following an investigation it emerged Galthié left the squad’s bubble on the opening weekend to watch his son play rugby, while players also went out to eat waffles when in Rome to play Italy, but France have been cleared of any wrongdoing. “I repeat it, all my actions, all our actions, were in compliance with the sanitary protocol, he said. The protocols protect well or even very well, but zero risk does not exist.”\\n',\n",

       "  'full_article': \"A convicted drug trafficker and former cartel leader has testified in a New York court that he bribed the Honduran president, Juan Orlando Hernández, with $250,000 in exchange for government contracts as well as protection from capture and extradition to the United States. “It was for protection so neither the military nor preventative police would arrest me or my brother in Honduras and so we would not be extradited to the United States,” Devis Leonel Rivera Maradiaga, a leader of the Honduran drug clan Los Cachiros, testified in the trial of alleged drug trafficker Geovanny Fuentes Ramírez. Rivera said the money, which was paid in 2012 when Hernández was head of Honduras’ congress, was delivered in cash to the president’s now deceased sister, Hilda. Hernández, who is listed as a co-conspirator in the indictment of Fuentes Ramírez, has repeatedly denied any involvement in drug trafficking. One of his brothers, Juan Antonio Hernández, was convicted of drug trafficking in the same court in 2019. Fuentes Ramírez pleaded not guilty on Monday. Rivera made a deal with the Drug Enforcement Administration in 2013 and turned himself in around two years later after the United States sanctioned shell companies Rivera said he owned. During that trial, the president was accused of accepting more than $1m from the Mexican drug trafficker Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán. US prosecutors have alleged that much of Hernández’s political rise was funded by drug traffickers who paid to be allowed to move drugs through Honduras without interference.   Related: 'Deeply alarming corruption': US bill would sanction Honduran president   Hernández’s government is expected to receive more cautious treatment from the administration of Joe Biden than it did from former president Donald Trump. On Wednesday, Roberta Jacobson, the former US ambassador to Mexico, who is now the White House coordinator for the southern border, said that none of the $4bn Biden wants to send for development aid in the Northern Triangle nations of Central America would go to the presidents of those three countries. Last month, Democratic senators filed a bill calling on Biden to impose sanctions on Hernández and “determine whether he is a specially designated narcotics trafficker”.\\n\",\n",

       "  'title': 'Robert Jenrick orders public inquiry into Cumbria coalmine',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'A controversial new coalmine planned for Cumbria appears to have been put on hold. The local government secretary, Robert Jenrick, had previously refused to intervene but on Thursday night he said he would take responsibility for the scheme away from the local authority. A notice from the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government sent to Cumbria county council said the cabinet minister was “calling in” the planning application. It cited “further developments” since Jenrick last considered the case, including a new report from the independent Committee on Climate Change, which advises the government on emissions targets. The letter, sent by an unnamed civil servant on Jenrick’s behalf, said that “proponents and opponents take different positions” on the committee’s recommendation of reducing demand for carbon-intensive activities and expanding low-carbon solutions, but that these should be investigated by a public inquiry. Controversy about the coalmine “has increased”, the letter also said, adding that Jenrick “considers that this application raises planning issues of more than local importance”. The inquiry will be handled by the planning inspectorate, and Cumbria county council was told to provide information on how the coalmine, planned for near Whitehaven, would be “consistent” with “meeting the challenge of climate change, flooding and coastal change”. Government sources denied that the move was a U-turn but Mark Jenkinson, the Conservative MP for nearby Workington, took to the Tory MPs’ WhatsApp group to disputethat. In messages seen by the Guardian, he called the decision “a remarkable volte-face” and “complete reversal” of the previous position, adding it was a “kick in the teeth for those ministers and MPs that repeated the secretary of state’s position on local decision-making”. Another northern Conservative backbencher agreed, and called it “another U-turn”. But Greenpeace called it “fantastic news and definitely better late than never”. And Friends of the Earth added it was a “startling, but very welcome U-turn”, and urged the government to refuse permission for the project.  Ministers have previously been criticised for not blocking the coalmine, particularly given that the UK is hosting Cop26, the UN climate summit, in November. Just weeks ago, one of the country’s most eminent environmental scientists, Sir Robert Watson, said it was “absolutely ridiculous” the government was refusing to act.   Related: Cumbrian campaigners warn minister of legal action over coalmine   James Hansen, one of the world’s foremost voices on the climate, also warned Boris Johnson that letting the mine proceed would lead to “ignominy and humiliation” for the UK. He said the plans for the mine showed a “contemptuous disregard for the future of young people”. Sir David King, a former chief scientific adviser, said Hansen “expressed it very well” and called the government’s decision a “big mistake”. Alok Sharma, the former business secretary put in charge of organising Cop26, was also said to be furious at the decision to let the project proceed. If it goes ahead, the underground mine would be the UK’s first in 30 years. Supporters of the £165m project say it would provide 500 jobs in what is among the most deprived areas in the country. Forty Conservatives MPs had written to the leader of the county council warning that stopping the mine would “represent a serious risk to Cumbria’s economic growth”. The council approved the mine, called Woodhouse Colliery, in October. Jenrick was urged to call in the application then but refused.\\n',\n",

       "  'full_article': 'Like Amazon’s profits and lucrative contracts for friends of government ministers, dog ownership has boomed during the pandemic. The Dog House (Channel 4) arrives at the perfect time to capture the national obsession with canine cuteness, but also to offer wise lessons on responsible pet ownership, and to call for greater consideration of what animals need – as opposed to what works for the humans in charge of them. This was a charming series when it first appeared a couple of years ago, and it has only grown more lovely. Set at the animal charity Wood Green, in Cambridgeshire, it follows prospective adopters as they are matched with an appropriate rescue dog, telling both human and dog’s life stories as best as they can. It is like The Repair Shop, in terms of pure-hearted good will and sentimentality, or First Dates – except one half of the potential match has four legs.Brothers Danny and Alfie are looking for a pet to welcome into the family. Their mother, Tula, explains that they would like a small dog, which usually means they’re going to be shown something only slightly smaller than a shire horse. Sure enough, they are introduced to, and fall in love with, Rocky – a soft, slobbering part-newfoundland, who is too depressed to eat after having to leave his former home. Young Danny has had some issues with anxiety around food, too, and his mother is hoping a dog will provide him with some emotional support and grounding. When Danny and Rocky click, it is a moment of utter joy. Couple Katie and Ryan arrive at the centre looking for their first dog, and want something companionable, sociable and playful. When Ryan reveals that after having a brain tumour, he can see “the joy in anything”, Katie insists that it’s true. “You’ve never heard anyone wax so lyrical about a custard cream,” she says. Never mind the biscuit: when he meets Kevin, a tiny french bulldog abandoned by his unscrupulous breeder at six weeks old, deemed too fragile to survive without expensive veterinary care, Ryan’s delight is so great that you can practically feel it radiating off the screen. The programme’s strengths lie in its compassionate eye for a human story, and how it carefully pairs that with a canine one. The adopters have to meet the dogs in a neutral environment before they are allowed to take them home, and it’s all observed on camera by the staff, who comment on how it’s going with the enthusiasm of a particularly eager sporting commentator. It sweeps you up in the drama. Rocky is massive and it looks as if he is too intimidating for Danny to even approach, but when they finally cross that barrier, and start to look like the perfect pair, it’s as if your favourite team have just scored in the 89th minute. The show also encourages responsible decision-making, without being bossy, and in the current climate of puppy-mania, this seems particularly apt. The staff explain that while they are grateful that people want to rescue dogs, it is crucial that they are there to listen to what the dog needs. It is a big responsibility to ensure that they find a person or people to suit the dog, as much as the other way around. And, while “adopt, don’t shop” is a strong slogan, rescue centres have struggled to meet demand during the pandemic. Clearly people are buying puppies, and it is worth shouting louder about the dangers and cruelties of puppy farms, too. Neither does it find the obvious happy ending every time. The formidable Maggie arrives at Wood Green with her two grandchildren, and discusses a long list of potential no-nos that would exclude a large amount of potential matches. She doesn’t want a dog that’s too old, nor one too young; she doesn’t want one that’s too big or too small, and she isn’t keen on flat-nosed breeds. “What do you want?” ask the staff, but she isn’t quite sure. She meets Leo, “a laid-back gentleman” whose owner has died, and who takes to Maggie’s lap with ease. But ultimately, she recognises that at 11, he is too old for her. She takes the time to find the perfect match, and does so off-camera, settling for a beautiful lurcher who loves to curl up in an armchair. “Dogs bring out the best in people,” says one member of staff. The Dog House is irresistible because it shows that it cuts both ways.\\n',\n",

       "  'full_article': 'Two internet providers are tracking and collecting the websites visited by their customers as part of a secretive Home Office trial, designed to work out if a national bulk surveillance system would be useful for national security and law enforcement. Details about the data collection experiment are limited, emerging via an obscure regulatory disclosure and a report in Wired, prompting campaigners to warn of a lack of transparency over data being “hoovered up into a surveillance net”. Under the two trials, the Home Office is working with the National Crime Agency to harvest “internet connection records (ICRs)” – information about which websites a customer visited, when they did so and how much data they downloaded.   Related: DWP uses excessive surveillance on suspected fraudsters, report finds   The metadata, as it is known, does not detail the specific pages visited on a given website, such as theguardian.com. But it can nevertheless point to a lot of personal information about an individual. That could include health or financial information, revealed because a browser visits a certain site or category of site frequently. The Open Rights Group, a digital campaign group, complained that details about the Home Office trial were insufficient. “This is a fairly staggering lack of transparency around mass data collection and retention,” said policy manager Heather Burns. “We should have the right to not have every single click of what we do online hoovered up into a surveillance net on the assumption that there might be criminal activity taking place,” she added. Home Office sources indicated that it was taking advantage of abilities in the Investigatory Powers Act 2016, to test what data can be acquired, how useful it is in practice, and how it might be used in investigations. The act was described as giving the UK government “the most extreme surveillance in the history of western democracy” by whistleblower Edward Snowden when it passed into law nearly five years ago. It aimed to legalise a range of tools for snooping and hacking by the security services unmatched at the time by any other country in western Europe or even the US, following Snowden’s revelations which showed the amount of mass surveillance that UK and US intelligence agencies already undertook. The first trial began in July 2019 after the Home Office “retention notice” request was approved by the Investigatory Powers Commissioner’s Office (Ipco) and related to an unnamed internet provider. A second trial relating to another phone company began in October of the same year, according to the regulator’s annual report.     A spokeswoman for Ipco said the trial was continuing, and part of its purpose was to ensure that the collection of metadata was “necessary and proportionate”. She added: “Once a full assessment of the trial has been carried out, a decision will be made on whether there is a case for national rollout.” The National Crime Agency confirmed it was working with the government on the trial. “We are supporting the Home Office-sponsored trial of internet connection record capability to determine the technical, operational, legal and policy considerations associated with delivery of this capability,” the police agency said.\\n',\n",

       "  'full_article': 'Boris Johnson came under concerted pressure to take action to tackle male violence and misogyny and make the UK safer for women, as the discovery of human remains in the search for Sarah Everard caused an outpouring of anger. The inquiry into the disappearance of the 33-year-old marketing executive added poignancy to the annual International Women’s Day debate in the House of Commons as dozens of female MPs told moving and angry stories of the harassment they had been subjected to. They also called for tougher action from the government when the police, crime, sentencing and courts bill returns to the House of Commons next week. Labour MP Jess Phillips read out the names of 118 women killed by men since last year’s debate. The government is yet to publish a long-promised strategy on tackling violence against women and girls. The prime minister’s spokesperson said on Thursday that ministers hoped to do so by the end of the year. The home secretary, Priti Patel, responding to the many women who have shared personal experiences in the wake of Everard’s disappearance, said she could relate to their stories. The home secretary said: “These are so powerful because each and every woman can relate. Every woman should feel safe to walk on our streets without fear of harassment or violence.” The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, speaking at a campaign event, underlined the scale of the problem – and urged men to call out abusive behaviour. “If we are to really confront this the first thing we need to do is to recognise the scale of violence against women and girls. And I’m not sure everybody appreciates just how prevalent and pervasive it is,” he said. “We all need to tackle this at root; we all need to recognise the issue and challenge behaviours,” Starmer added. “I think there’s a particular issue for men. It’s very important for men to speak out on this issue.” A recent survey by UN Women UK found that 97% of women aged 18-24 had been sexually harassed, while 80% of women of all ages said they had experienced sexual harassment in public spaces. The government will face cross-party pressure to use the crime and sentencing bill to take tougher action on crimes against women, when the wide-ranging legislation returns to the House of Commons next week. The Guardian understands Labour’s Harriet Harman will urge the government to enshrine the victim’s right not to have their previous sexual history cross-examined in court, an amendment that has widespread cross-party support. The government was also challenged by the Lib Dems’ Wendy Chamberlain to make misogyny a hate crime as part of the domestic abuse bill. A cross-party amendment supported by a string of charities, including the Fawcett Society and the Jo Cox Foundation, would make all police forces in England and Wales record misogynistic crimes as hate crime, a campaign started by the Labour MP Stella Creasy. The amendment will be voted on in the House of Lords next Monday. “The challenge to the government is – pass the domestic abuse bill – it’s been in the offing for four years. Legislate to make misogyny a hate crime. Make sure that those occupying positions of trust are people we really can trust,” Chamberlain said. Speaking in the debate, Phillips said it was abhorrent that the government still did not collect detailed data on the numbers of women killed each year and the circumstances of their deaths. “In this place we count what we care about, we count the vaccines done, we count the number of people on benefits, we rule or oppose based on a count and we obsessively track that data,” she said. “However, we don’t currently count dead women … Dead women is this thing we’ve all just accepted as part of our daily lives. Dead women is just one of those things. Killed women are not vanishingly rare – killed women are common.” Phillips, who has made it a tradition to read the names at each year’s IWD debate, said she was indebted to the work of Karen Ingala Smith and the Counting Dead Women project who compiled the list. Harman, who is mother of the house as the longest serving female MP, criticised the words of the Met police commissioner, Cressida Dick, who said abductions of women on the street were rare – though acknowledged the fear many women would be feeling. The former Tory cabinet minister Maria Miller said Everard’s disappearance had “sent shockwaves around the UK” because many women could relate her last movements to their own regular routine. “For many women this news story will bring back memories of threatening situations they found themselves in, through no fault of their own, being sexually harassed on the streets walking home from meeting friends, anonymous threats of physical violence on social media, sexually assaulted in plain sight in rush hour and public transport on the way to work,” she said. The former Conservative cabinet minister Andrea Leadsom, said the strength of feeling merited cross-party action. “I feel angry that women walking home in the dark have to be scared of the person walking closely behind them and sad because for far too many women even getting home safely doesn’t mean they’re safe from harm. So I say to all colleagues right across the house, let’s never let party politics get in the way of protecting women and girls.” Labour’s Rosie Duffield, who spoke last year of her own experience of domestic abuse, said there had been an “outpouring of collective rage over the last 24 hours” and compared the anger to the Black Lives Matter protests. “Sarah Everard has reignited a fire within us, much like George Floyd did. Enough is enough. We must take a long hard look at society, at social media, at misogyny, at ourselves. And let’s hope that next year’s list is virtually non existent,” she said. Marsha de Cordova MP, the shadow women and equalities secretary, criticised the minister for women and equalities, Liz Truss, for not attending the debate, leaving Maria Caulfield to give the government’s response. De Cordova described the debate as, “the first time since the beginning of this pandemic that ministers have put aside time to talk specifically about women”, and called it “unacceptable” that Truss had not attended. A spokesperson for the Government Equalities Office said Truss had an immovable diary commitment, but had contributed heavily to Caulfield’s speech.

When Anthony Martial’s hip injury is factored in – the striker needs a scan to determine its seriousness – this was a particularly difficult night for Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s side. Martial joins Marcus Rashford as a doubt for West Ham’s visit this Sunday, with a third forward, Edinson Cavani, also ruled out, according to the manager.   Related: Filip Helander's away goal heartens Rangers after slow start at Slavia Prague   While Solskjær is hopeful Rashford, at least, could return for Thursday’s second leg at the San Siro, Milan were certainly worthy of their vital away goal. Stefano Pioli’s side were always positive and, for large swathes, the dominant force. It means United are now underdogs to progress to the quarter-finals. Solskjær is always keen to defend his team but was unable to regarding Kjær’s late intervention. “It’s a header from six yards – he can save it, of course,” the Norwegian said of Henderson. “I have seen him save them but it’s the structure [overall] we lose. We dropped too deep and get blocked off and he [Kjaer] makes a good run and gets a good header on it. We should have attacked the ball with the men we had there. “I am very disappointed to concede like that with the header. It makes it harder of course, but it was always going to be going down to the second game.” Of Martial’s injury, Solskjær said: “Ant has a whack on hip – it’s another forward we need to scan and look at. Definitely hope he’s back for Thursday but I’m not sure for Sunday, we’ll need him. Don’t think Edinson will be ready for Sunday. Marcus will be ready for next Thursday. I am not sure if he will be ready for the weekend – fingers crossed. And Cavani maybe, as well, for the Milan game.”    Amad Diallo scored his first goal for Manchester United in his third appearance for the English side. Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty Images   Milan arrived in the mood to force the issue, and their pressing inside United’s half caused problems. What Solskjær’s side did not need to do was switch off, which they did when Davide Calabria’s throw-in was allowed to reach Franck Kessié. His 20-yard strike gave Henderson no chance but, after a delay, VAR ruled the midfielder had handballed to control. United remained in slumbering mode when Rade Krunic swept in a long free-kick that no red shirt wanted to claim aerially. Milan were caught offside but what United required were smelling salts to jolt themselves awake. There was zero pattern to their play. Instead, the visitors tapped the ball around in a manner that had the feeling of a schooling for United. When Bruno Fernandes could finally look ahead in possession, his intended pass was too short and the attack fizzled out. Instead, Calabria could thrust from right-back into United’s area to cause havoc, and the home side escaped again in what was becoming a Harry Houdini-act of a half. Their next close shave came when Martial jumped out of a challenge near Milan’s area. Suddenly, Brahim Díaz broke fast, Alexis Saelemaekers took over and cut inside from the right. Henderson’s fingers were warmed by his fierce effort. At that point, Harry Maguire shouted to his teammates to stop giving the ball away. The captain might also have implored his team to get out of backward gear, fast. But they did start to brighten and soon went close to an unlikely opener. Alex Telles swung in a corner from the right which Fernandes flicked on. He looped the ball over Gianluigi Donnarumma, who managed a faint touch, before Maguire hit the post from inches. The ball went across goal but somehow stayed out, and the score remained goalless. “I won’t make any excuses for that,” the centre-back said. “I should put it in the net.” At the break, Solskjær replaced the injured Martial with Amad Diallo, who was about to have a dream impact. Fernandes earned a free-kick in a central area and passed to Nemanja Matic, who gave the ball back to him. The Portuguese looked up, spied Diallo’s clever inside-right run and expertly chipped it over. The youngster’s flick past Donnarumma oozed class. It was a fine way to open his United account, and Milan were stunned. Their response was to bombard Henderson’s goal, with Pioli’s team feeling they should have had a penalty when Aaron Wan-Bissaka reached over Díaz to head clear and the latter went down. As a spectacle, the contest continued to improve. Calabria zipped over a cross which Krunic flung his head at, connecting with the ball but unable to keep it down. Then United offered a rare counterpunch when Greenwood combined with Diallo, before finding Dan James in space. The winger was under no pressure, but his control faltered.

It dazed United, who have much work to do next week: more regulation errors and they may be out of Europe.\\n\",\n",

       "  'title': 'Sarah Everard suspect: Met faces inquiry over indecent exposure claim',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'The Metropolitan police are to face an inquiry into whether the force properly investigated a claim of indecent exposure involving the suspect in the alleged murder of Sarah Everard, just days before the marketing executive disappeared. PC Wayne Couzens has been arrested on suspicion of the kidnap and murder of Everard. He has also been arrested on suspicion of an indecent exposure involving another woman, and this is the incident that will be investigated by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC). The alleged indecent exposure happened on 28 February, at a fast food restaurant in south London. Everard disappeared after leaving a friend’s house in the south of the capital at about 9pm on 3 March and beginning a 50-minute walk home.  The IOPC said in a statement: “The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) has started an independent investigation into whether Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) officers responded appropriately to a report of indecent exposure. “The IOPC’s investigation follows a conduct referral from the MPS in relation to two officers, received last night, which is linked to four other referrals. They are all connected to the arrest of a serving MPS officer on suspicion of kidnap, murder and a separate allegation of indecent exposure. “Our investigation will look at the actions of the MPS after police received a report on 28 February (2021) that a man had exposed himself at a fast food restaurant in south London.” The IOPC will investigate the claims about the indecent exposure allegation independently. The Met, Britain’s biggest police force, was stunned by the news that the suspect was one of their own serving officers. The inquiry into Everard’s disappearance was continuing on Thursday night, with searches continuing in Ashford, Kent at a site where police believe they have found human remains, which are yet to be formally identified. Sarah’s family on Thursday spoke of their pain and painted a vivid picture of the joy she had brought to their lives. In a statement, they described the marketing executive as a “bright and beautiful” woman.  They described her as a “wonderful daughter and sister”, adding: “She was kind and thoughtful, caring and dependable. She always put others first and had the most amazing sense of humour.” They added: “She was strong and principled and a shining example to us all. We are very proud of her and she brought so much joy to our lives. “We would like to thank our friends and family for all their support during this awful time and we would especially like to thank Sarah’s friends who are working tirelessly to help.” The statement, which was issued before the one from the police watchdog, added: “We are so grateful to the police and would like to thank them for all they are doing. We are now pleading for additional help from the public. Please come forward and speak to the police if you have any information. No piece of information is too insignificant. Thank you.” It is understood the detectives believe whoever took Everard came across her at random, and did not know her previously. Couzens, who served in the parliamentary and diplomatic protection unit, remains in custody at a London police station after an application to extend his detention was granted at Wimbledon magistrates court, Scotland Yard said. He was initially arrested at his home in Deal, in Kent, on Tuesday on suspicion of kidnapping Everard, while a woman in her 30s was held on suspicion of assisting an offender. She has been released on bail to return to a police station on a date in mid-April. On Wednesday evening, the Met commissioner, Dame Cressida Dick, said the human remains, which have not yet been formally identified, had been found in an area of woodland about 20 miles west of Couzens’ home and the suspect was further arrested on suspicion of murder. On Thursday, it emerged Couzens had been taken to hospital after suffering head injuries while in police custody. Scotland Yard said he was discharged back to his cell but refused to release any further details. The Met has referred the incident to the IOPC which says it will “determine what further action may be required”. A vigil titled Reclaim These Streets is due to take place on Clapham Common on Saturday, near where Everard was last seen as she made her way home to Brixton and many people have shared stories of the measures they feel forced to take when walking Britain’s streets. However, on Thursday night organisers claimed that they had been threatened with fines and prosecutions if the vigil went ahead. In statement, Reclaim These Streets said: “The Metropolitan Police … stated that the vigil would be unlawful, that their ‘hands are tied’ by the Covid-19 regulations and that, as organisers, we could face tens of thousands of pounds in fixed penalty notices and criminal prosecution under the Serious Crimes Act.” They added: “We have decided to seek an urgent order from the high court confirming that the Metropolitan Police’s understanding of the law is wrong.” Organisers raised around £30,000 in a matter of hours to cover legal fees. The Met said it “remained in discussions with organisers”. The prime minister, Boris Johnson, said he was “shocked and deeply saddened” by the disappearance of Everard, adding: “We must work fast to find all the answers to this horrifying crime.” And the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, acknowledged that the capital’s streets are not safe for women or girls, telling LBC: “It’s really important that people of my gender understand that. “If you’re a woman or a girl, your experiences of our city, in any public space, whether it’s in the workplace on the streets, on public transport is very different to if you are a man or a boy, and it’s really important that people like me in positions of power and influence understand that and take steps to address that.”\\n',\n",

       "  'title': \"Hawaii: flooding forces evacuations as officials warn 'this is climate change' \",\n",
       "  'full_article': '  Sign up for the Guardian Today US newsletter  Heavy rains triggered flooding on multiple Hawaiian islands this week, destroying homes and bridges and setting off mass evacuations. The downpour, officials and climate scientists say, is an example of the more intense rainstorms that are occurring more frequently as the planet warms. The rainstorms this week first affected Maui, moved northward up the island chain to Oahu and Kauai, then circled around and hit the southernmost part of the Big Island. On Oahu, flooding covered roads and yards in towns on the eastern coast. Rising waters in the Opaelua stream, which carries waters from the mountains down to the ocean, set off an evacuation order for the small town of Haleiwa, a mecca for big-wave surfers. Honolulu firefighters rescued a 27-year-old man after his truck was swept down a stream, and suspended the search for an individual a witness saw in a stream in Pearl City.   Related: Hawaii governor declares emergency after floods and landslides   Meteorologists on Wednesday extended a flash flood watch for the entire state through Friday because of the potential for more rain and because the ground was already saturated. “This is really an example of climate change in the present day,” Suzanne Case, the head of the department of land and natural resources, said in a statement. “We have a flood emergency because of the heavy rain bomb. And we’re seeing these more and more across the island chain – more frequent and more extreme events.” The warming climate is affecting rainfall patterns in the state. A 2010 report from the University of Hawaii’s Sea Grant College Program said rainfall declined 15% over the prior 20 years. Yet the same report found between 1958 and 2007, rain events with the heaviest downpours increased 12%, underscoring that more intense rainstorms are growing in number. Pao-Shin Chu, a University of Hawaii professor and the state’s climatologist, said theoretical studies suggest that for every one-degree Celsius increase in sea surface temperatures, there is likely to be a 7% increase in atmospheric moisture. Hawaii is experiencing some of this increased moisture already. In 2018, Kauai set a national record for the amount of rain recorded in a 24-hour period when 49.69in (1.26 meters) fell from 14 April to 15 April. The same storm set off landslides and blocked the only highway connecting small Kauai north shore towns to the rest of the island. The frequency of intense rains like that one and this week’s are an indication people should be prepared for such events more often, Chu said. “Don’t think that this is like a once-in-a-hundred-years event that you’ll only see once in your lifetime. It is changing,” Chu said. Less time is lapsing between them, he added. “So it could be once every 30 years. Who knows?” To better prepare for future disasters, he said it will be important for scientists to understand how weather was interacting with a warming climate to cause so much rain to fall in such a short period. The Honolulu mayor, Rick Blangiardi, said the city will need to work with state partners to keep waterways clear of debris to help prevent flooding. “We need to get used to climate events like this,” Blangiardi said. “A tremendous concentration of rain in a small amount of time in focused areas is going to result in flooding anywhere. If we have situations like that, then we need to really approach and attack.”\\n',\n",

       "  'title': \"There's no justification for Waitrose keeping its Covid rate relief cash | Nils Pratley\",\n",
       "  'full_article': 'On the face of it, you might think the John Lewis Partnership is entitled to every penny of government support it can lay its hands on. It’s just reported a thumping annual loss of £517m as it took a £648m hit against the value of its department stores, eight of which closed for good last July. If pandemic support was designed to help businesses in crisis and minimise job losses, what’s the problem? It’s the fact that the picture was very different at Waitrose, recipient of £85m of the partnership’s overall tally of £190m of government support. The supermarket chain’s sales were up 10% and top-line profits improved by £82m to £1.1bn.   Related:  John Lewis to close more stores as Covid crisis wipes out profits   To be scrupulously fair, the latter figure is a trading number, and so ignores central costs, some of which will have been inflated by the boom in online deliveries. Even so, the broad picture is correct: in financial terms, Waitrose did OK. So why can’t the chain follow Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Morrison’s and Asda and return its relief from business rates? None of the pleas from the boardroom are persuasive. The partnership may think of itself as a single entity, but the relevant consideration with a property-based tax is surely whether the stores were open. The department stores were closed for 20 weeks, so, fine, keep that pot of money. But £85m of relief for Waitrose can’t be justified. Dame Sharon White, the chair, has overseen a decent crisis-fighting exercise at the department stores. Even if more stores may be lost as the pandemic compounds the effects of past overexpansion, the trading figures were better than feared. But on the Waitrose rates relief money, she made the wrong call.    A Royce Trent XWB engine on the assembly line at Rolls-Royce’s factory in Derby. Photograph: Paul Ellis/AFP/Getty Images   Rolls-Royce throttles back “The worst is now well behind us,” said the Rolls-Royce chief executive, Warren East, after a year in which the engine-maker clocked up a colossal loss of £4bn. The bigger question, though, is how long recovery takes. The best that can be said is that Rolls’ predictions, made at the time of its £2bn rights issue last October, have proved roughly accurate so far. One critical measure is engine flying hours, since it dictates the revenues received under maintenance contracts with big airlines. Rolls had assumed 2020 would see a fall to 45% of 2019’s level – in the event it got 43%, which is near enough. For this year it thinks 55%, then 80% in 2022. The latter is a downgrade from 90% since the last finger-in-air exercise, which is not an immaterial difference since the rule of thumb says each percentage point equates to £30m of receipts. But East is sticking to his critical forecast that Rolls will generate £750m of cash in 2022, which is the point at which the enormous restructuring exercise, involving 9,000 job losses, can be said to have worked. While it waits, Rolls would benefit from good news elsewhere in its business. The government has put a few quid behind the development of small modular reactors that look a smarter and lower-cost nuclear option than more Hinkley Point-style mega-constructions. The Rolls-led consortium could do with an actual order.    The HSBC logo on one of its bank branches in the City of London. Photograph: Facundo Arrizabalaga/EPA   HSBC lumps it on coal The juiciest scrap during the upcoming season of corporate annual meetings was meant to be at HSBC, where a group of 15 fund management houses had filed a resolution calling on the bank to curtail its financing of fossil fuels. The resolution would probably have struggled to achieve the necessary 75% supermajority, but the potential for embarrassment for HSBC was high. Amundi, Europe’s largest fund manager, was in the rebels’ camp. BlackRock, the world’s biggest, was under pressure to join, and thereby back the chief executive Larry Fink’s high-minded climate words with hard votes. Thursday, however, brought news of a peace deal. HSBC will volunteer its own resolution to phase out the financing of coal and set targets to align its lending with the Paris agreement. In return, the shareholders will drop their proposal. Investors still have to back the board-led resolution and HSBC still has to live up to its commitments. But it is the first time that ShareAction, the charity that led the negotiations with HSBC, has withdrawn a shareholder resolution, so it’s a landmark event of sorts. It should also put other big lenders under useful pressure. It’s just a shame we’ll have to wait until the next showdown to discover if BlackRock and Fink are serious.\\n',\n",

       "  'full_article': \"This was not a match to endorse the credentials of either Slavia Prague or Rangers to make inroads beyond the Europa League’s last 16. Yet on the basis progression from this very stage is the task in hand, Steven Gerrard can be content by the taking of parity back to Glasgow. Rangers’ key fear resonates in the ghosts of Leicester City, who held Slavia to a scoreless draw in the Czech Republic before coming unstuck in the Midlands.   Related: Manchester United v Milan, Slavia Prague v Rangers: Europa League clockwatch – live!   This tie is perfectly poised. Slavia dominated for long spells against the newly crowned Scottish champions but lacked bite. Still, it took a sensational Allan McGregor stop in the final minute of regulation time to earn Rangers their draw. The 39-year-old, who has been one of Rangers’ players of the season, left Lukas Masopust in visible disbelief by diving low to not just save but hold a ferocious header. McGregor’s acrobatics will be on video loops for years to come. “We needed to call on Allan at an important time to make a world class save,” said Gerrard. “I’d say a draw was fair. This is a difficult place to come. Once we settled, we more than matched them.” It was easy to make the case for Slavia before a ball had been kicked. The Czech league leaders have a formidable home record, with the exertions as attached to Rangers’ weekend title triumph seen as having at least some impact. Such theories belied how impressive Rangers have routinely been in the Europa League over the past two seasons but it was legitimate to view Slavia as first leg favourites.    Slavia’s Nicolae Stanciu, right, celebrates scoring the opener. Photograph: Petr David Josek/AP   The hosts dominated the early stages. Switches of play were a key aspect of Slavia’s attack; from one of the first, the young Rangers full-back Nathan Patterson saw himself faced with both Peter Olayinka and Nicolae Stanciu. There was plenty to do as Olayinka flicked the ball into the path of his Romanian teammate, with Stanciu’s curling finish from 19 yards delivered with wonderful skill. McGregor did not move. Slavia continued to swarm thereafter. Jan Kuchta shot wide and McGregor saved smartly from a Lukas Provod free-kick as the Czechs chased a second.   The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.  That it did not arrive would have been an obvious Slavia concern, given Rangers’ recurring potency. One goal does not tend to be sufficient to defeat Gerrard’s team.   Related: Manchester United denied win against Milan by Simon Kjær's late equaliser   When an equaliser did arrive, it was via an unlikely source. Even the centre-back Filip Helander couldn’t miss from all of a yard after Ianis Hagi’s cut-back. An inswinging Borna Barisic free-kick as knocked on by Connor Goldson preceded Hagi’s involvement. Slavia’s high defensive line had been exposed. The second period had been scrappy before a Ryan Kent attempt almost crept under the crossbar of the home goalkeeper, Ondrej Kolar. That 65th minute opening emphasised growing confidence among the Rangers players. Gerrard’s men were afforded an even better chance moments later, Goldson failing to properly connect with another menacing Barisic set play. Patterson blocked from Oscar Dorley as Slavia chased a late winner they would have regarded as highly useful, if not quite essential, in respect of next Thursday at Ibrox. Rangers looked wholly content with their lot even before McGregor’s brilliance. “You react to it, stick your hand out and hopefully it doesn’t go in,” said the goalkeeper. This analysis didn’t do the incident justice. To put it mildly.\\n\",\n",

       "  'full_article': \"It is tempting to assume that an American drama about black women caught in the cold, hard machinery of Britain’s monarchy is a direct response to Meghan’s revelations to Oprah Winfrey earlier this week. But theatre cannot move quite this fast and even though Vivian JO Barnes’ two-hander was inspired by the duchesses of Sussex and Cambridge, she conceived it in 2018 and it was filmed by Steppenwolf theatre at the end of last year. The marketing gods, however, could not have aligned the stars for a greater impact for the digital premiere of a play billed as “a darker version of what might have happened if Meghan Markle had stayed”. That line gestures towards the surreal, satirical and incrementally creepy tone of this 35-minute dualogue. Staged as a teatime meeting between The Duchess (Sydney Charles) and The Soon-to-be-Duchess (Celeste M Cooper), and directed by Weyni Mengesha, the couple’s exchanges seem deliberately wooden and gather sinister undertones that climax in the grotesque act of the final moments. The Duchess is already grounded in the ways of the institution and performing royal duties and has recently given birth (“I’m leaking”). She is meeting the Soon-to-be-Duchess in order to educate her in palace protocols for women – and black women – entering into royalty.   Watch an interview with the playwright Vivian JO Barnes  The Duchess seems more automaton than human – a regal version of a Stepford wife, lobotomised by institutional protocols, although sad vestiges of her former self remain. “Pretend you’re not here,” is her advice in the event of being surrounded by paparazzi. “Say to yourself … ‘They are not doing this to me.’” The Soon-to-be-Duchess, by contrast, is bright-eyed and bursting with character. She hopes to tear down the palace’s icy traditions, though we begin to wonder how long it will take for her vivacity to be leached – or forcibly extracted. The actors add disturbing little flourishes to their performances and even when the script loses its subtlety, a greater sense of confusion and dread remains.   Related: 'I didn't want to be alive any more': Harry and Meghan describe racism and royal animosity in Oprah interview   The Duchess reads out one palace memo that commands her never to wear green because it is not “becoming” on her. Another bears blatant suggestions of colourism that says she must endeavour to behave in a way that is “a little less cocoa” and “more beige”. The Soon-to-be-Duchess admits she does not know how to curtsy and wants to skip the formal gesture but is told that she must do so at all times, even in a meeting as informal as this one. These moments of satire gain an almost incredible prescience in their critiques on race and female submission in relation to the British monarchy.  Of course it is all just fiction, but it might be seen as a kind of bellwether as to how Americans perceived the British royal family long before Meghan’s revelations. The drama is the fourth in the six-part Steppenwolf Now virtual programming series, which brings together an array of dramatic forms and genres, from an engrossing two-part audio soap opera, Wally World, set in a department store and written by Isaac Gómez, to a thoughtfully angsty animation, Red Folder, written, directed and illustrated by Rajiv Joseph. The series, performed by the Chicago theatre’s ensemble, is well worth watching, and not just for its latest bombshell instalment.  Duchess! Duchess! Duchess! is available until 31 August. \\n\",\n",

Court documents have shown that Townsville police used a controversial neck hold banned in jurisdictions across the world during the arrest of an Indigenous man who died in 2018. The 39-year-old, known as Noomba, was arrested after his wife called police because she was concerned about his mental wellbeing. “Thirty years on since the royal commission, how is it possible that our people are still dying in custody and not a single person or institution has been held to account?” Thorpe said yesterday. “When will we have peace?” Labor has accused the Morrison government of walking back on its commitment to get Australians “fully vaccinated” by October.

       "  'title': 'Endemic violence against women is causing a wave of anger',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Women feared this was coming. They waited, messaging each other in WhatsApp groups and on social media. They talked about their own attempts to stay safe, discussed their near misses. When the news came on Wednesday evening – that police investigating the disappearance of Sarah Everard had found the remains of a body – a wave of grief crashed over them, followed quickly by anger. “I have never known such an outpouring of rage and fear,” said the feminist author and campaigner Caroline Criado-Perez. “She was just walking home, something that we have all done, and which we have all experienced fear doing.”   Related: This week has shown us how far feminism still has to go | Gaby Hinsliff   Public anger, women’s anger, is rising. A Reclaim These Streets vigil is planned for Saturday evening on Clapham Common, London, and at least nine others are planned in towns and cities such as Cambridge, Cardiff, Liverpool and St Andrews. However, organisers have said they have been warned by police they face fines and prosecution under Covid rules. A fundraising drive to launch a court challenge to the Metropolitan police’s interpretation of the rules raised the required £30,000 within hours. “We are having a #MeToo moment right now,” said the writer Mary Morgan, one of the vigil’s organisers. “Women are sharing their stories, they are showing the world the realities of gender-based violence, and how deep and widespread of an issue it is. We need urgent societal change.” The facts are stark: a woman dies at the hands of a man every three days, according to the Femicide Census carried out by Karen Ingala Smith and Clarrie O’Callaghan. According to their grim calculation 1,425 women and girls were killed in the UK between 2009 and 2018.  Those deaths are just the tip of a deep, profound and intractable iceberg, said Andrea Simon, the director of End Violence Against Women (Evaw). “Violence against women and girls is an epidemic, and it has reached endemic proportions,” she said. The last year saw a global and national increase in domestic violence, and an increase in rape reports even as the number of prosecutions has collapsed. This week a UN Women UK survey revealed that almost all young women have experienced sexual harassment in public places. Evaw’s most recent report from January reels off a battery of horrifying statistics: almost one in three women will experience domestic abuse, two women a week in England and Wales are killed by a current or former partner, more than half a million women are raped or sexually assaulted each year. Simon pointed out that it is rare for a woman to be killed, rarer still by a stranger. According to 2018 ONS data, 33% of female homicide victims were killed by partners or ex-partners, compared with 1% of male victims. But the total number of women killed in the year ending March 2019 increased by 10% from 220 to 241, the second consecutive annual increase and the highest number since 2006. Women’s anxiety about walking streets at night is not irrational, but informed by knowledge of the violence women face on a daily basis, from micro-aggressions to murder, said Simon. “We all know that fear. Every woman knows that fear of what might happen, if they just go about their everyday lives without thinking and planning and making decisions about where they can go, what they should wear, where they should sit,” she said. A major part of the problem is the criminal justice system’s repeated failure, she said. Rape convictions, dropping since 2017, fell to a record low this year – only 1.4% of cases reported to the police resulted in a charge by the CPS. At least 1,000 fewer men accused of rape are currently being prosecuted than two years ago. “There needs to be a consequence, and the criminal justice system is not delivering that,” said Simon. “Whether it’s sexual harassment, or the most serious sexual assault, there isn’t really a penalty being meted out to the vast majority of offenders – so where’s the deterrent?” The past 12 months has also been particularly bleak for those working in tackling domestic abuse. During the first national lockdown the National Domestic Abuse Helpline saw an 80% increase in calls; Karma Nirvana, which supports victims of so-called “honour-based” abuse and forced marriage reported a 162% average increase in caseloads. The government’s promise of £165m for domestic abuse support service falls far short of the £393m that Women’s Aid estimates is needed for domestic abuse alone. And the last three months of 2019 saw domestic abuse prosecutions fall by almost a quarter. No one at government level is joining up the dots, said Farah Nazeer, chief executive of Women’s Aid. With 92% of defendants in domestic abuse-related prosecutions in the year ending March 2020 recorded as male, and 77% female victims – the crime is heavily gendered. “There is a blindness about what causes violence against women,” she said. “The abuse, harassment and murder of women is a reflection of systemic misogyny and sexism within society.”     The domestic abuse bill, reaching its final stages, is progress, she said. It will create a new domestic abuse tsar, recognise abuse can be emotional and economic, and end the defence of “rough sex”. Local authorities will have to provide safe accommodation to victims and their children, who are recognised as victims in their own right. But, said Nazeer, it fails to reference the need and provision for “women’s refuges”, which she fears opens the door to generic provision becoming more common in the sector. According to Imkaan research, 50% of specialist refuges have been forced to close or have been taken over in the last decade. Further losses would be terrible news for black women and minoritised women, who are not only at greater risk, but are also more likely to be sidelined and ignored, said Pragna Patel, from Southall Black Sisters. And while she welcomed the domestic abuse bill, it could not be divorced from a wider conversation about how patriarchy is embedded in state structures, she said. “We need to explicitly acknowledge that violence against women and girls as a cause and consequence of gender inequality.”   Related: The Guardian view on violence against women: without safety, there can be no equality | Editorial   New compulsory relationships and sexuality education in England was a step forward, but undermined by parents’ ability to opt out until the age of 15, she added. The bill could also help shift the dial on the way violence against women is measured and treated, if an amendment to make all police forces to record misogyny as a hate crime is adopted, said Stella Creasy, the Labour MP for Walthamstow. “I urge every woman who has walked with keys in her hands at night, been abused or attacked online or offline to come forward and be heard,” she said. “This is our moment for change – women should be equally able to live free from fear of assault or harm simply for who they are.” But the law can only go so far, said Harriet Wistrich, the director of the Centre for Women’s Justice. “Laws are only worth the paper they are written on if they are implemented and combined with informed understanding about the way that women are targeted by male violence,” she said. After a devastating week, women working to end violence against women and girls were tired, she added. “But we have to remember that it’s a battle,” she said. “That isn’t a reason to give up, it’s a reason to keep fighting.”  In the UK, call the national domestic abuse helpline on 0808 2000 247, or visit Women’s Aid.

       "  'title': 'Sunak defends budget plans and insists 1% rise for NHS staff is fair',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Rishi Sunak has rejected criticism that his budget plans to repair the government’s finances after Covid-19 were unrealistic, and insisted a 1% pay rise for NHS staff is fair. The chancellor said the pay offer, alongside plans for a wider public sector pay freeze, was “proportionate, fair and reasonable” given the damage to the government’s finances caused by the pandemic and as many workers in the private sector have lost their jobs. Answering questions from MPs on the Commons Treasury committee on Thursday, Sunak said the process was being handled by the NHS pay review body but that it was a government decision to recommend the 1% increase. Ministers have insisted the nation could not afford a higher offer, sparking intense anger across the public sector. “For a matter of fairness, but also to protect people’s jobs in the public sector given what was going on in the private sector, we set out a targeted approach to public sector pay, which we thought was proportionate, fair and reasonable,” Sunak said. The chancellor said the plan came “in recognition of the circumstances that we face” with the government’s budget deficit – the gap between spending and receipts – on track to reach £355bn this year. It comes after Sunak faced criticism that his budget lacked credibility for including plans to spend £15bn a year less on public services from 2022-23 than envisaged before the Covid pandemic. Mel Stride, the Conservative chair of the Treasury committee, warned the legacy of the pandemic would probably include greater demands on public services, telling the chancellor: “The way I’m looking at it there is a £15bn cut relative to previous plans. I would’ve thought that would be one of the areas where you’d be worrying quite a bit about that.” However, Sunak insisted it was not a cut, despite it being labelled as such by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility. He said spending was set to rise by 2.1% once inflation is taken into account, which would leave the size of the state by the mid 2020s at historically high levels. “Spending grows over the parliament and grows in every year. What you’re referring to are changes in forecasts from previous fiscal events. That’s not a cut in spending. Spending is growing over this parliament very strongly,” he said. However, the chancellor hinted that permanently higher levels of tax may be needed in future to fund public services, despite concerns from backbench Tory MPs that the tax take as a percentage of GDP would rise to 35% – the highest since Roy Jenkins was chancellor in the late 1960s. “If there are demands on the spending side that are larger, it is reasonable to expect that those have to be paid for. I think most people will understand that,” he said.   Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk   Sunak was also forced to defend the government’s record on procurement of PPE and spending on its Covid test and trace programme, in the wake of highly critical reports from parliamentary watchdogs questioning value for money. “Given we were dealing with a pandemic it was appropriate that we approached this with a degree of flexibility,” he said. The chancellor insisted making sure taxpayers’ money was spent well was “really important” and that if there were any lessons the Treasury could learn it would do so. However, he added: “Whilst saying that it’s important to remember the context we’re operating under at the time.”\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'Biden signs $1.9tn Covid relief ahead of first primetime address as president',\n",
       "  'full_article': \"Joe Biden signed the historic $1.9tn Covid-19 relief package into law on Thursday, hours before he will deliver his first primetime TV address as US president to mark one year since the virus triggered widespread shutdowns across the country. “This historic legislation is about rebuilding the backbone of this country,” Biden said in brief remarks before signing the landmark legislation. Biden is expected to use his televised speech to hail the stimulus bill known as the American Rescue Plan, which the White House has touted as the biggest progressive spending package in generations that is critical for steering the US towards the end of the pandemic.   Related: $1,400 stimulus checks and vaccine funds: what the Covid relief bill contains   But Biden is also expected to acknowledge the ongoing pain caused by the pandemic, which has claimed the lives of nearly 530,000 Americans and brought unemployment, hunger and dislocation to tens of millions more. And he is also expected to offer hope, asking for optimism as beleaguered Americans face what comes next. Previewing the speech, Biden said he will outline what his administration plans to do to help guide the US through a huge vaccination program and rebuild shattered lives and businesses in the months ahead. “I’m going to launch the next phase of the Covid response,” the Democrat said on Wednesday. “There is light at the end of this dark tunnel of the past year. But we cannot let our guard down now or assume the victory is inevitable. Together, we’re going to get through this pandemic and usher in a healthier and more hopeful future.” A White House official said the speech will last less than 20 minutes and will note how controlling the pandemic and administering vaccines has been the “greatest operational challenge the country has faced”. So far, more than 62 million people across the US have been vaccinated. Biden said this week that the US “hit a record of 2.9m vaccinations in one day in America” on Saturday. The speech is resonant in its timing, coming a year to the day since the World Health Organization declared the spread of the coronavirus a pandemic. It’s also a year to the night since Donald Trump, the former president, delivered a similar televised address on the pandemic that came after he repeatedly claimed the virus would somehow disappear on its own.   Related: 'It will disappear': the disinformation Trump spread about the coronavirus – timeline   One year ago the pandemic became tangible for most Americans, with many companies telling staff to work from home, if they were able to, sporting bodies such as the NBA canceling games and Broadway shows shuttering in New York City. The period since has seen waves of the virus surge across the country, with the deficient response of several states and the Trump administration seeing healthcare systems pushed close to collapse and millions of frontline workers, particularly people of color, suffer the brunt of the pandemic. At the height of the pandemic, more than 14% of working Americans were out of a job. Biden has sought to instill optimism over the course of the pandemic since becoming president, with the rate of new infections and hospitalizations now starting to fall. His administration has set a goal of 100m vaccine shots in the first 100 days, something the president was upbeat over in a visit to a Washington DC hospital this week. “We’re really warping the speed now,” Biden said. “We’re doing pretty good across the country. We’re going to hit 100m soon.” Life remains upended for millions of Americans, however. The stimulus package is the first major legislative victory of Biden’s presidency and promises to raise millions of Americans out of poverty. It includes $1,400 payments for eligible individuals along with hundreds of billions of dollars more to bolster vaccine distribution, extended unemployment assistance and child tax credits.    Related: Biden's $1.9tn Covid relief bill marks an end to four decades of Reaganism | Analysis   No Republicans in Congress voted for the bill, claiming it was bloated and unnecessary, but Biden, a Democrat, appears to have strong public support for the measures. Polling has shown a clear majority of American voters support the Covid aid package and approve generally of the way the president has handled the coronavirus crisis since taking office. Challenges still remain in delivering vaccines, however, as well as the actions of several states, such as Texas, that have started to ease restrictions such as mask mandates. More than 18m doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine will be shipped to states, tribes and territories this week, the White House said, with another 100m additional doses of the single-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine set to be delivered later this year. Biden has previously said there will be enough vaccine for all American adults by the end of May. There is still no plan for the vaccination of children, although the president is also hoping to push forward the reopening of schools. The Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) has new guidelines that allow the gathering of fully vaccinated people with vaccinated grandparents or friends without masks or socially distancing, but there is still no indication when it will be safe for people to travel again or for life more broadly to return to normality. “There are a lot of folks who are older, people with chronic diseases,” Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, told ABC. “Let them get vaccinated and I think it will happen in the next month or so then we can begin to relax these restrictions and get our lives back.”\\n\",\n",

       "  'title': \"‘It's very hard’: Rory McIlroy starts Players Championship with erratic 79\",\n",
       "  'full_article': \"Even more alarming than an opening round of 79 for Rory McIlroy at the Players Championship was the Northern Irishman’s ominous assessment of his current struggles. “It’s very hard, especially when you’re trying to figure it out as you go along on course,” McIlroy said. “You’re trying to figure it out but you’re not really sure where the shots are coming from. It’s hard to at least to try to eliminate one side of the golf course, basically.” With now less than a month to go until the Masters, McIlroy finds himself in a race against time. A return to Sawgrass, where McIlroy won in 2019, was supposed to kickstart his season. Instead, he took a double bogey at the 10th – his 1st hole – having found forest from the tee. McIlroy twice landed in water to the left of the 18th fairway and reached the turn in 43.   Related: Rory McIlroy says Tiger Woods is 'doing better' after car crash   He said: “I just think it’s hard to recover when you just haven’t played good. Regardless, if you take that 18th hole out it still wasn’t a very good day.” Indeed, McIlroy’s wayward long game mirrored struggles on the greens. The four-times major winner, who has slipped to No 11 in the world, had 34 putts. He three-putted four times. McIlroy’s frustrations were surely only intensified by how easy his playing partner, Sergio García, was making things look. The Spaniard, a Sawgrass specialist, signed for a 65 to race into the early lead but had words of comfort for his Ryder Cup teammate. “On this course, you don’t have to be that far off to get penalised a lot,” García said. “So it happens. You try to force things a little bit and unfortunately for him, it bit him a little bit. But I told him when we finished, just go out there tomorrow, get at it and you never know. I shot seven under so he can shoot seven under tomorrow and hopefully make the cut.” In at least proving McIlroy’s problems were not unique, Henrik Stenson delivered six sixes and a seven en route to an 85. Rickie Fowler and Ian Poulter both produced 77s. Lee Westwood continued the fine form he displayed at last weekend’s Arnold Palmer Invitational courtesy of a 69. “It’s a run of tournaments that we’ve done before,” Westwood said. “I always play well when I play on a run rather than stop-start.” Matt Fitzpatrick and Corey Conners both bettered Westwood’s score by one.\\n\",\n",

       "  'full_article': \"The referee Darren Drysdale has been given a retrospective four-match suspension after he was found guilty of improper conduct when he “snarled” into the face of a player who had verbally abused him. The unprecedented case was heard by an independent judicial panel after the Football Association charged Drysdale following events late in a League One fixture between Ipswich Town and Northampton Town when the referee stopped play to book Ipswich’s Alan Judge for simulation in trying to win a penalty.   Related: The end of Champions League's Messi and Ronaldo era? – Football Weekly   In testimony, Drysdale related his version of events. He said that when he blew his whistle Judge had charged towards him screaming: “It’s a fucking penalty you cheating bald cunt.” Drysdale had then moved his head towards Judge “as a posture of authority”, he told the panel, “and with the player being significantly shorter than me, this led to me looking down at him”. He also admitted to snarling at the player. The player himself refused to give testimony, and said he did not want to bring charges. He also denied using the word “cunt”. Judge later told Ipswich’s website: ‘I wasn’t looking for an apology. I didn’t want to make anything of it because it’s a tough job being a referee but I’m not going to keep quiet when I’ve been accused of calling the referee a cheat and using the C word. I’ll admit using the F word but I said to him ‘you have got to be F…… joking me and I said that a couple of times to him. I never used the C word. I don’t use that word and I didn’t call him a cheat. Our media team have got some audio and it backs me up.” The panel found that Drysdale had made no physical contact with Judge. Citing “no other relevant cases which assist us directly”, the panel decided that Drysdale deserved a four-match sanction because his behaviour came while in a position of authority. The panel also found “extensive mitigation” in his favour, however. Drysdale had apologised publicly for his behaviour which was deemed by the panel to be “completely out of character”, noting his former career in the RAF. The panel also accepted his remorse as genuine. Central to the mitigation was the strength of the language directed at Drysdale, which the panel said should have resulted in Judge receiving a red card. In testimony Drysdale said the abuse was “the worst he had experienced as a referee”. In introductory remarks to their written reasons for the judgment, the chairman of the panel, Christopher Quinlan QC, drew explicit attention to the abuse received generally by referees, declaring it “unacceptable”.   The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.  “Match officials are entitled to, and should, be treated with respect by all participants,” Quinlan wrote. “The incessant abuse and haranguing of match officials is unacceptable. It besmirches the sport and is inexcusable. Behaviour of this kind seems generally to be tolerated in football, often by match officials themselves. In our judgment, it should not be.” After consultation with the referee’s body, PGMOL, it was concluded that Drysdale had missed four matches for which he would have been considered for selection while waiting for his hearing.\\n\",\n",

       "  'title': 'National Press Awards to be postponed after Society of Editors race controversy',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'The National Press Awards will be postponed, the Guardian understands, after the board of the Society of Editors concluded that a series of withdrawals over its statement that there was no racism in the British media threatened its integrity. The decision emerged in an emergency meeting on Thursday prompted by the resignation of Ian Murray, executive director of the industry body, over his statement in response to the Duchess of Sussex’s claims in her interview with Oprah Winfrey. After Murray’s withdrawal critics of the body had demanded a clearer repudiation of his initial statement than the clarification issued earlier this week. It is understood that after the meeting a new statement is being drafted. In the meeting, which one participant described as “testy” and another as “difficult but a move towards a better result”, most participants are understood to have agreed that stronger language was needed to bring the crisis to an end after a number of editors including those of the Financial Times, Guardian and HuffPost criticised the initial statement. Journalists and outlets from the Daily Mirror to the Bristol Cable have since withdrawn from at least some categories in protest. One participant said the meeting was dominated by “deep frustration and anger” and concerns that the credibility of the body had been significantly damaged – to the extent that there was discussion of whether it was still capable of functioning properly. It is understood that at least one board member questioned the inclusion of language saying that structural racism was an issue in the British press. The board was seeking a position that would satisfy the SoE’s critics and achieve a broad consensus, with fears that if it were to explicitly say that media outlets have published racist content or rely on racist structures other publishers could withdraw as a protest of their own. Seeking to push a clearer repudiation of the initial statement is a group including the news editor of the Voice, Vic Motune; PA Media’s managing director, Polly Curtis; the former BBC editorial director, Kamal Ahmed; the former Sunday Times editorial director Eleanor Mills, and the editor of the i, Oliver Duff. On Thursday Motune added his voice publicly to those critical of the initial statement, writing on the Voice’s website: “Although the Society of Editors’ executive director, Ian Murray, has resigned, my deep disappointment at his comments denying the fact that sections of the UK press are racist strongly remains.” Noting that he had not been consulted on the initial statement and would not have approved of it, he added: “The comments do not represent what I know – the UK media fails to accurately reflect the lives and aspirations of all BAME persons in Britain.” Some in that group had sought the postponement in the awards, due to be held on 31 March, with a number of outlets withdrawing from contention and the host, ITV News presenter Charlene White, also stepping back after the initial statement was released. Earlier on Thursday, 151 journalists of colour followed up an open letter earlier in the week with a new statement saying that while Murray’s resignation was a reflection of the gravity of the circumstances “this has never been about one man”. They went on: “We now look forward to the Society of Editors withdrawing its denial of the racism which exists in our industry and explaining more fully what action it will take to address it, starting with its own awards scheme, which has consistently failed to recognise the talent and achievements of journalists of colour.” As evidence of that issue, the group pointed to analysis it has carried out showing that between 2017 and 2019, just six of 104 national awards to individual journalists went to journalists of colour – only two of them women. The Society of Editors has pointed to its Driving Diversity and Reporting Diversity categories as evidence of its attempts to improve the situation. But at least a dozen of 27 individual categories at this year’s award have only white journalists shortlisted. The Daily Mirror and local publication the Bristol Cable joined those withdrawing from at least some categories on Thursday. The Mirror editor, Alison Phillips, announced the outlet’s decision on Twitter, saying that it would withdraw from contention from the Driving Diversity category. Darren Lewis, Eva Simpson and Jason Beattie, nominated for work for the Mirror, also withdrew from contention. The Bristol Cable said: “Implicit and explicit racism has long been present in parts of the British media, often used cynically to attract clicks and sales. Those bearing the brunt are often members of the public without a platform to expose bigotry or its impacts.” Open Democracy said it did not plan to withdraw its entries. Noting that it “respects the decisions of other outlets which have done so” it said it wants to “enter, be present in and disrupt spaces of exclusion in the media”.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': \"Three UK government LGBT advisers quit with rebuke of 'ignorant' ministers\",\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Three of the government’s LGBT advisers have resigned from their posts and criticised the equalities ministers Liz Truss and Kemi Badenoch. Jayne Ozanne, a member of the LGBT advisory panel, quit on Wednesday, accusing ministers of creating a hostile environment for LGBT people and claiming Truss and Badenoch were ignorant on key issues. The Government Equalities Office later confirmed that James Morton, who has been a manager at the Scottish Trans Alliance, had resigned from the same panel. Morton said he had been “very concerned for several months that Liz Truss and her junior ministers are not committed to LGBT equality”, the BBC reported. “It doesn’t appear that they’re doing anything useful or helpful for trans people in terms of government policy.” On Thursday Ellen Murray, a policy and research officer for Transgender Equality Network Ireland, became the third member of the panel to quit, accusing ministers of acting “in appalling faith”. She tweeted: “There’s precious little patience I have left for the government at this point, but with what remains: get your act together. Use the panel for what it was intended and actually prohibit conversion therapy. Stop deporting LGBT refugees. Drop the trans culture war.” Ozanne said she had sat in meetings with Truss and Badenoch and “been astonished about how ignorant they are”.  She said that while Boris Johnson was a friend of the LGBT community, she felt the need to quit so she could criticise government proposals on banning “conversion therapy” because the plans did not have the confidence of the LGBT community nor “many senior religious leaders”. MPs from across the political divide have expressed frustration at the government’s delay in bringing forward legislation to outlaw conversion practices. These treat sexuality as a choice or mental health problem, and use some form of treatment or psychotherapy to try to change a person’s sexual orientation or suppress their gender identity. The Tory backbencher Gary Sambrook complained in a Commons debate this week: “I want to send a message to the government that it has been three years since this promise to ban conversion therapy. We have got to get on with it and make sure that we deliver on it.” Badenoch reassured him and other colleagues: “We are committed to ending conversion therapy in the UK and we take the issue very seriously.” But speaking to ITV News on Wednesday, Ozanne said: “I do not believe this Tory government, sadly, have the best wishes of the LGBT community at heart. Instead we seem to have a Trump-esque mode of operation where they’re listening to the rightwing evangelicals and those, frankly, who want to take us back.” Ozanne said Truss and Badenoch were “known among the community as the ‘ministers for inequality’” because they did not understand LGBT people, particularly transgender people. “There are many who fear that we are going back to the days of Thatcher, the days of section 28,” she continued. “The language that I hear from them is of us being woke, or of being loud lobby groups, and what they don’t seem to understand is the reason we have to shout is because we are hurting, because there are people who are vulnerable who are going unheard and unnoticed.” Peter Tatchell, the human rights campaigner, has called on Badenoch to resign for “failing to deliver” the ban on conversion practices. He said her “feeble statement” on Monday “was the last straw”. “Kemi claimed she was ‘consulting widely’ but none of the 20-plus organisations supporting a ban have been consulted,” he said. “Kemi has lost the confidence of the LGBT+ community.” Labour accused the government of having “prevaricated” on banning conversion practices “for far too long” and claimed it revealed “a pattern of behaviour which seeks to dismiss the real impact of the discrimination experienced by so many”. The shadow equalities secretary, Marsha de Cordova, said: “The government must get on with setting out a clear plan now which will see an end to this inhumane practice that has no place in modern Britain.” A government spokesperson said: “The government is committed to building a country in which everyone, no matter their sexuality, race or religion, is free to live their lives as they choose. We have repeatedly made clear that we will take action to end conversion therapy and we are working to bring forward plans to do so shortly.”\\n',\n",

       "  'title': \"Uber driver assaulted by unmasked rider: 'People all over have experienced this'\",\n",
       "  'full_article': 'An Uber driver in San Francisco who was assaulted by an unmasked passenger has spoken out about the incident, saying that he was attacked after asking the woman to get out of the vehicle and taunted because of his race and job. Video of the incident went viral, prompting a police investigation an an outpouring of support for the driver, Subhakar Khadka. In an interview with the Guardian, Khadka, who is from Nepal, said that between constant feelings of anxiety, fielding calls from media outlets and talking to family and friends back home, he has only gotten about three hours of sleep each night since the footage came out. Khadka described himself as a private person who just wants to work and support his family overseas. And while the recognition he is receiving is overwhelming, he was glad to have video evidence of abuse that often goes unacknowledged. “It’s not just the people in Ubers and Lyfts, it’s also people who work in gas stations. People from all over the world reach out to tell me they’ve experienced and report this type of behavior but because of lack of evidence it doesn’t go anywhere and people learn to live with it,” Khadka said. “I hope this can serve as an example so we can raise enough awareness so that when someone is assaulted hopefully they speak up and justice can be served,” he added. Footage appears to capture the culmination of an incident that Khadka said began when he picked up three women on Sunday afternoon, and unfolded over several blocks.  UBER RIDERS COUGH ON, ASSAULT, PEPPER SPRAY DRIVER Driver Subhakar Khadka, who is South Asian, says he believes he was targeted because of his race. He picked up 3 women in the Bayview yesterday afternoon on San Bruno Avenue. https://t.co/Tzr7kTfyKQ pic.twitter.com/f8PiHDZ9CZ— Betty Yu (@BettyKPIX) March 9, 2021  The video shows Khadka being berated and coughed on by one of the women, who was riding in the back seat of his car without a mask. Khadka said he picked up the three women early on Sunday afternoon. He said the woman seated in the middle seat did not have a mask on, despite Uber’s policy that riders must prove everyone is wearing a face covering before confirming their ride. Khadka began to drive off, but once he noticed the unmasked woman he reminded them of the policy and pulled over. The women asked him if he had an extra mask. Khadka told them he didn’t, and he said that was when things started going downhill. “They tried to make it look like it was my fault even though they ordered Uber without a mask,” Khadka said. “The girl that assaulted me started taunting me and asking how I could stop a car in the middle of nowhere but we were half a block from where I picked them up.” Khadka said he then pulled into a gas station so the rider could buy a mask. While she was in the store the other two passengers allegedly began a barrage of violent threats and insults. “Before the girl came back with her mask I had to listen to taunts about how they could shoot me in the face and call their boyfriends and cousins on me,” he recalls. “They talked about how small my testicles are because of my race. They called me a goofy-ass N-word after every sentence.” By the time the passenger came back to the car with a pack of masks, Khadka decided that the trip was not worth the risk to his safety. “I told them that the ride was over and to please get out of the car,” Khadka said. “They kept taunting me, telling me that I’m nobody and that they would stay in the car. It was three ladies versus one guy who can’t even verbally defend himself in English.” Khadka said that he turned his camera on when he realized they weren’t budging, and that was when the woman started coughing into his face and screaming at him. Seconds later the video shows the woman snatching Khadka’s cellphone out of his hand. Khadka claimed that one of the women sprayed Mace inside the car after getting out. “She emptied her pepper spray can in my car. I accidentally put my hand on my face and it started hurting,” he recalls. San Francisco police have said they are investigating the incident.  (1/4) The victim, a 32-year-old male, TNC driver picked up three passengers at San Bruno Avenue and Felton Street on March 7, 2021 at approximately 12:45PM. One of the passengers was not wearing a mask. pic.twitter.com/2J9NsM8MG2— San Francisco Police (@SFPD) March 10, 2021  Both Uber and Lyft tweeted that the rider who refused to wear a mask had been permanently removed from their platforms. She has since appeared to try to contextualize her actions in an Instagram video, admitting that she was wrong for coughing on Khadka, but she said that she was scared for her and her fellow passengers’ safety because Khadka allegedly tried to kick them out in an unfamiliar area and refused to wait until a new rideshare arrived. The woman in the video has not responded to the Guardian’s request for further comment. Khadka said he had been driving for Uber for three years but left when the pandemic began and started driving on and off for UPS. The decline in Covid-19 infections and vaccine rollout encouraged him to come back in January. Weeks later he was accosted. “I don’t know how much time I’m gonna have to take to recover,” he said. Khadka said that Uber initially offered him $20 in cleaning fees. “The frustration was that I asked for the cleaning fee and then they gave me $20 then $40 but I knew the extent of the damage to my car. Those droplets are everywhere; it’s not safe to drive. I explained that and nothing was done.” Khadka said the company has since deposited $250 – the estimate for cleaning that Khadka sent to Uber – in his bank account, and when his story became international news, a representative for the company offered more money in medical expenses and to compensate for the time he is taking off of work. Uber said it offered him additional money and other forms of support in recent days, according to an email sent to the Guardian. Khadka said he has yet to accept their offers for additional compensation.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'Heads in England fear pushy parents will demand better exam grades',\n",
       "  'full_article': \"School leaders fear teachers in England are being aggressively lobbied by “parents with pointy elbows and lawyer friends” to boost their children’s GCSE and A-level grades this summer. This, they say, could have a devastating effect on the attainment gap between well-off and disadvantaged pupils. Richard Sheriff, executive headteacher of Harrogate grammar school and president of the Association of School and College Leaders, said he was worried that schools were being left exposed by the government’s policy of replacing exams in England with grades awarded by teacher assessment. Sheriff said he feared that “parents with pointy elbows” would be more prepared to push for their children to receive better grades, meaning pupils with parents unable or unwilling to confront teachers were likely to be left further behind.   Related: England's teachers will feel the pressure over student grades this summer | Anonymous   “We must protect teachers. If this is all about who can shout the loudest to get their child the furthest, then we certainly won’t be closing the attainment gap, will we? And we certainly won’t be doing anything about social equality in any way whatsoever,” Sherriff said, speaking before ASCL’s annual conference, which begins on Friday. Geoff Barton, ASCL’s general secretary, said the headteachers’ union had warned the government there needed to be strict quality assurance mechanisms to take the pressure off teachers and allow them to justify their decisions. “Right from the beginning, from the very first day, we’ve seen examples of where parents have been emailing individual teachers, saying: ‘My daughter wants to be a doctor in the future, she needs to get a grade 9 in chemistry at GCSE,’” Barton said. “We also have to protect teachers through all of this and when people talk about ‘teacher assessment’, it does seem to me to be unhelpful because it sends out the message that if I’m your chemistry teacher, it’s me sticking my finger up in the air. It won’t be. “That’s why we argued behind the scenes for a more robust quality assurance process to protect individual teachers and individual schools throughout this process.” ASCL criticised recent comments by Simon Lebus, interim chief regulator of the exam watchdog Ofqual, that there would be “a negotiation” between students and their teachers over what their final grade should be. “That’s certainly not the way we saw it,” Barton said. The ASCL also warned that parents remained confused by the government’s guidance about Covid testing in schools, in particular its decision that a pupil with a positive result from a school-administered lateral flow test could not return to the classroom even after receiving a negative result from a higher standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. Reports from secondary schools suggested that students and staff had adapted well to more stringent mask-wearing routines since they returned this week. But Sheriff said his feeling from visiting classrooms was that there were downsides: “I was in a classroom today and it’s so difficult to gauge the mood of a class when you can’t see their faces.”   Related: English school leaders despair over new rules on Covid tests and masks   Since the return to school, some young people have been mixing socially outside school, including visiting each other’s homes despite the remaining restrictions, which Sheriff said was a concern. “We only have control over a very small part of their day. Whether the return to school signifies a greater amount of that social mixing beyond the school is probably my biggest concern,” he said. “I think that, in school, controls are really good, generally they’ve been very good indeed. But outside school, if going back to school is a signal that everything’s fine and we can carry on as we are, then that’s the dangerous bit.” • This article was amended on 12 March 2021.

       "  'title': '‘The NHS at its best’: making a Covid mass vaccination centre a reality',\n",
       "  'full_article': '“It’s been a big job putting this together,” says Laura Churchward with a sigh. She is referring to the weeks of intense planning, hard work and attention to detail that went into the opening – just minutes earlier – of the Business Design Centre in Islington as the NHS’s latest Covid mass vaccination centre. The London exhibition centre usually hosts trade fairs. But on Wednesday the only visitors were 44 NHS staff, St John Ambulance personnel and volunteers, and about 200 grateful recipients of the jab, some of whom had waited in the rain outside to get into the venue. It is now one of 134 mass vaccination centres (MVCs) in England, 15 of which opened this week alone. They are a key part of the vast infrastructure the NHS has established since November to administer the Oxford/AstraZeneca and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines to – so far – about 20 million people. The 1,660-strong network of sites also includes 268 “hospital hubs” for NHS and social care staff, 224 pharmacies and 1,034 GP-run sites, many of which are family doctor surgeries. Churchward is already a veteran at helping to create MVCs. The Business Design Centre is her fifth. Her usual role is as director of strategy at University College London hospitals NHS trust. But when the pandemic struck she switched to setting up coronavirus testing centres, and then to establishing premises to speed up the rollout of the vaccines. NHS England have put UCLH in charge of organising the vaccination programme to the 1.5 million people who live in the London boroughs of Camden, Islington, Haringey, Barnet and Enfield, working in partnership with other hospitals and GPs in the area.    The Business Design Centre is the fifth centre Laura Churchward’s has helped create. Photograph: Sean Smith/The Guardian   The new MVC delivered 200 jabs in the three and a half hours it was open for on Wednesday. “But that will increase to 500 a day from next week, thanks to increased vaccine supply,” says Churchward. The deployment of the vaccines across England has been impressive so far but should move up another gear next week when the number of jabs delivered daily is planned to double from about 400,000 to 800,000. Vaccine supply in UCLH’s five boroughs has been uncertain, Churchward admits. “Last week it was touch and go whether or not we’d have enough vaccine to open up this site today, so we had to get 500 doses from the Francis Crick Institute,” the scientific research centre behind the British Library in central London, which is also doubling as an MVC. “We’ve had to move vaccine around the system on a weekly basis to ensure each site has enough.” Ultimately the glass- and steel-roofed hall will be able to host 2,500-3,000 jabs daily. “These MVCs are there to jab big numbers of people – mega-numbers. They’re for the mainly healthy population, not the elderly and vulnerable who were done at first.” The vaccinators on day one included Ed Wild, a professor of neurology, as well as an ICU nurse and A&E staff, who all usually work at UCLH. “This is the NHS at its best,” says Churchward. This is the second time the Business Design Centre has helped the country achieve a key goal since it opened in 1862 as the Royal Agricultural Hall. The bombing during the second world war of the Mount Pleasant post office half a mile away led to its inland and foreign parcels departments being rehoused at the hall. There are 421 floor stickers to guide arrivals around in a socially distanced way. The centre has 24 vaccination booths, 78 hand sanitiser stations, 55 computer stations and 202 blue plastic chairs for those waiting for their turn, going through check-in or giving their consent.    A view of the the Islington Business Design Centre set up as an MVC. Photograph: Sean Smith/The Guardian   Diana Kootstra, UCLH’s construction programme manager, inspected the hall in December and judged it to be an ideal MVC because of its size, accessibility, good public transport links and excellent ventilation. Once she worked out how to ensure safe patient flow around it, UCLH reached a deal with its owners. A team of 17 architects, quantity surveyors, engineers, data analysts and a construction team have all played their part over the last 10 weeks It was originally due to open on 22 February. That had to be delayed, though, because of uncertainty over whether there would be enough vaccine available, and also whether enough people would be eligible to come, which itself depended on how quickly the nine priority groups for vaccination, as decided by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, were invited. That has now reached group eight, those aged 55 and over. Ivan Clark, a 62-year-old data analyst, was one of the first to get jabbed at the repurposed venue. Consent has to be taken by a doctor or nurse, so he gave his to a UCLH nurse. He received his jab in his left arm from Neal Pun, a second-year medical student at University College London. While some of the vaccinators are NHS staff, many are volunteers who have been trained. “It was seamless. I only had to wait for five minutes. All the marshals showed me where to go,” said Clark, who wore his West Ham face mask throughout. “I was utterly gobsmacked that we beat the 15.2m target before the 15 February deadline that Boris Johnson set. I analyse all the government data every day and the vaccination rollout is a success story – it’s incredible. I can’t say the same about the rest of the government’s response to Covid, though.”\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'John Lewis shoppers fear closures could be final blow to high street',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'As John Lewis considers closing yet more outlets around the country, the department store chain stands at a crossroads. Celebrated for its customer service, but under pressure to shift away from physical retail and into online sales as it nurses pandemic losses of £500m, the retailer is poised for major change. Shoppers fear that could mean the final blow for many local high streets. The group closed eight department stores last year, including large spaces in Birmingham and Watford, smaller At Home stores in Croydon, Newbury, Swindon and Tamworth, and two in travel hubs at Heathrow airport and St Pancras station in London. The fate of up to eight more now hangs in the balance as John Lewis says it expects to conclude negotiations with landlords before the end of this month. While those stores have not been named, shoppers expressed fears their local outlet would be on the list. Residents in towns and cities across the country already know their local Debenhams or House of Fraser will not reopen, making the potential loss of a John Lewis an even heavier blow. “John Lewis has always been part of my retail shopping life, having shopped there and in Waitrose for as long as I can remember,” said Sharon Goddard, 64. “The store in Norwich is a great place to shop with wonderful staff. It is the heart of the city, and now that Debenhams has gone its importance has grown even more. If it were to close, the inhabitants of Norwich and Norfolk would miss it incredibly. It would rip the heart out of this historic city.” Another long-term fan, Christine Dunn from Penarth in Wales, said: “It will be devastating for Cardiff if it closes.” Dunn said her fears for her nearest store’s future had been raised after it seemed poorly stocked on a visit last summer. “We made the journey in to support the shop and Cardiff city centre. I was disappointed. Before the pandemic it was a lovely shop.” Others described their local John Lewis as “the centre of town”, “a popular meeting place for people of all ages” and “a pleasurable shopping experience”. While many shopped online, they said trying on clothes, testing out a sofa or getting advice on technology was not possible via the internet, adding that they enjoyed the cafes and visiting the physical store as a leisure experience.   Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk   Matthew Wood, 28, from Reading, said John Lewis’s management were being too swift to make changes. “They shouldn’t be closing stores when they have barely any competition left in the department store sector. We still haven’t seen what trading will be like once Debenhams has gone and I think they should wait and see how it plays out,” he said. But some felt stores were well past their sell-by date and John Lewis had no choice but to move with the times. In Leeds, one shopper felt staff were not sufficiently knowledgable and had lost the glamour of retail’s better days. “Most of the staff look like they’re wearing pyjamas or as scruffy as you (wouldn’t) believe. Good riddance,” he said.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': \"MPs say women not reassured by Met's comment that abduction is rare\",\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Women will find no reassurance in the Metropolitan police’s statement that the abduction and murder of women on the street is rare, multiple MPs have said, with dozens calling for further action from the government to tackle male violence and misogyny. In a Commons debate for International Women’s Day, which took place hours after the news that human remains had been found in the search for missing Sarah Everard, the Labour MP Jess Phillips read out the names of 118 women killed by men since last year’s debate. Female MPs from across different parties told moving and angry stories of street harassment they had been subjected to, and called for tougher action from the government when the police, crime, sentencing and courts bill returns to the House of Commons next week. The Guardian understands Labour’s Harriet Harman will urge the government to enshrine a victim’s right not to have their previous sexual history cross-examined in court when the bill comes to the Commons on Monday, an amendment that has widespread cross-party support. The government was also challenged by the Liberal Democrats’ Wendy Chamberlain to make misogyny a hate crime as part of the domestic abuse bill. A cross-party amendment will be voted on in the Lords next week to make all police forces in England and Wales record misogynistic crimes as hate crimes, a campaign started by the Labour MP Stella Creasy. “The challenge to the government is: pass the domestic abuse bill. It’s been in the offing for four years. Legislate to make misogyny a hate crime. Make sure that those occupying positions of trust are people we really can trust,” Chamberlain said. Phillips said it was abhorrent that the government still did not collect detailed data on the numbers of women killed each year and the circumstances of their deaths. “In this place we count what we care about, we count the vaccines done, we count the number of people on benefits, we rule or oppose based on a count and we obsessively track that data,” she said. “However, we don’t currently count dead women … Dead women is this thing we’ve all just accepted as part of our daily lives. Dead women is just one of those things. Killed women are not vanishingly rare – killed women are common.” Phillips, who has made it a tradition to read the names at each year’s IWD debate, said she was indebted to the work of Karen Ingala Smith and the Counting Dead Women project who compiled the list. Harman, who is the mother of the house, as the longest-serving female MP, criticised the words of the Met police commissioner, Cressida Dick, who said abductions of women on the street were rare but acknowledged the fear many women would be feeling. “Every young woman, every day, walks under this threat,” Harman said. “So women will find no reassurance at all in the Metropolitan police commissioner’s statement that ‘it’s extremely rare for a woman to be abducted off the street’ – women know abduction and murder is just the worst ends of a spectrum of everyday male threat to women. So let’s hear no more false reassurances, let’s have action.” Harman said the government could show it was serious to “banish the culture of male excuses from the criminal justice system” when the sentencing bill comes to parliament.    Harriet Harman: ‘Women know abduction and murder is just the worst ends of a spectrum of everyday male threat to women.’ Photograph: UK Parliament/Jessica Taylor/PA   The former Tory cabinet minister Maria Miller said Everard’s disappearance had “sent shock waves around the UK” because many women could relate her last movements to their own regular routine. “For many women this news story will bring back memories of threatening situations they found themselves in, through no fault of their own, being sexually harassed on the streets walking home from meeting friends, anonymous threats of physical violence on social media, sexually assaulted in plain sight in rush hour and public transport on the way to work,” she said. “We should not accept a culture of violence towards women, we should not be complicit in covering it up, and we need to give women effective mechanisms to report what happens, to expose the scale of the problem, to call it out publicly and to punish those who perpetrate this culture of fear.” Caroline Nokes, the chair of the women and equalities committee, said she had seen an “outpouring of stories from women about keys, headphones … sticking to lit streets. We all know the reality is you will not be attacked by a stranger, but the fear is there, and the fear is real.” The former Conservative cabinet minister Andrea Leadsom said the strength of feeling merited cross-party action. “I feel angry that women walking home in the dark have to be scared of the person walking closely behind them, and sad because for far too many women even getting home safely doesn’t mean they’re safe from harm. So I say to all colleagues right across the house, let’s never let party politics get in the way of protecting women and girls.” Labour’s Rosie Duffield, who spoke last year of her own experience of domestic abuse, said there had been an “outpouring of collective rage over the last 24 hours” and compared the anger to the Black Lives Matter protests. “Sarah Everard has reignited a fire within us, much like George Floyd did. Enough is enough. We must take a long, hard look at society, at social media, at misogyny, at ourselves. And let’s hope that next year’s list is virtually nonexistent,” she said. Bell Ribeiro-Addy, the MP who represents the Streatham constituency where the apparent abduction took place, said women in the community had been “shaken to the core” by the incident. “I choose to challenge the disgusting victim-shaming that we have seen since Sarah’s disappearance, it should go without saying that victims of gender violence are not to blame. Sarah did nothing wrong. All she did was walk home,” she said, adding that she would join a vigil being organised for Everard on Clapham Common near where she went missing. Marsha de Cordova, the shadow women and equalities secretary, criticised the minister for women and equalities, Liz Truss, for not attending the debate. “This International Women’s Day debate falls a year into a pandemic that has had huge consequences for women, especially black, Asian and ethnic minority women, disabled women and mothers. It is the first time since the beginning of this pandemic that ministers have put aside time to talk specifically about women, despite the hugely unequal socioeconomic impact of the pandemic,” she said. “It is unacceptable that the minister for women and equalities did not even bother to turn up for the debate.”\\n',\n",

       "  'full_article': 'Ashley Giles has begun plotting a possible route for Alex Hales to return to the England setup nearly two years on from his controversial World Cup omission after admitting the door cannot stay closed on the opener forever. Giles, the director of England cricket, held what have been described as “positive” talks with Hales’ agent on Thursday 24 hours after Eoin Morgan, the white-ball captain, played down his chances of making the squad for this year’s T20 World Cup in India.   Related: England must learn lessons from India tour but future still looks bright | Ebony Rainford-Brent   Any decision here will probably still come down to Morgan, who accused Hales of a “complete disregard” for the team’s culture when, on the eve of the 50-over World Cup in 2019, he was hit with a 21-day ban for failing a second recreational drugs test. But while the pair have not spoken since bar a brief exchange of text messages 12 months ago Giles appears keen to give Morgan the option with the plan to invite Hales to England training when the white-ball team play at home this summer. “There has to be a way back in,” Giles told Sky’s Cricket Show, during an interview recorded shortly before his meeting with the 366 Group that represents Hales. “During this [recent] period, bringing someone back in to reintegrate them has been difficult because we’re living bubble life. But I certainly hope there are opportunities during this year to do that. “He’s a high-class player. We’re lucky that we’re blessed with a lot of high-class players in our T20 lineup particularly. But the door can’t be closed forever. As we all know, trust is a really important thing when you play in teams and that has to be won back.” Since losing his World Cup berth and being stripped of his central contract at the end of the 2019 season, Hales has gone on to considerable success as a specialist Twenty20 batsman in the T20 Blast, the Pakistan Super League and Australia’s Big Bash League.

       "  'title': \"Covid test kit supplier joked to Hancock on WhatsApp he had 'never heard of him'\",\n",
       "  'full_article': 'The former neighbour of Matt Hancock who is supplying the NHS with millions of Covid test tubes joked to the health secretary that he had “never heard of him” during a private WhatsApp exchange. The exchange, seen by the Guardian, suggests Alex Bourne, a former publican who had no prior experience of producing medical devices before he began supplying the government, may have downplayed his relationship with Hancock in public. The messages, which suggest an easy familiarity between the two men, were sent in late November, shortly before the Guardian published a story about Bourne’s work supplying the NHS and his links to the health secretary. In a WhatsApp message Hancock sent to Bourne about the imminent story, the health secretary called the newspaper “a rag”. Bourne wrote back: “Matt Hancock – never heard of him,” before assuring the health secretary that his lawyers were “all over” a reporter investigating their connection “like a tramp on chips”. The disclosure of the messages is likely to intensify pressure on Hancock to fully explain how Bourne’s company came to be awarded lucrative work supplying test tubes for use in NHS Covid test kits. Bourne, Hancock and the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) have all insisted the health secretary had no role whatsoever in awarding the work. Bourne’s company, Hinpack, which he runs from his father-in-law’s industrial potato farm in Cambridgeshire, has been beset by problems. It recently voluntarily recalled at least 8m test tubes that had been delivered to warehouses for the NHS over quality issues. Bourne initially offered his company’s services to the health secretary at the start of the pandemic in a personal message sent to Hancock’s WhatsApp on 30 March. Those messages have not been publicly revealed, but Bourne said Hancock referred him to the DHSC website. At that time, Hinpack made plastic cups and takeaway boxes for the catering industry. The company’s 2019 accounts state Hinpack was at that time technically insolvent. His lawyers said the Companies House filings at that time reflected the fact Hinpack was a startup and its debts were loans from Bourne himself, “a man of private resources”. The firm was able to convince officials in the NHS supply chain and two of its major distributors that it was capable of supplying tens of millions of sterile test tubes. In total, Bourne has been asked to supply orders worth nearly £50m for Covid tests as a subcontractor to one of the NHS’s official distributors, Alpha Laboratories. Bourne’s lawyers deny that Hancock helped their client in any way and have also denied the pair are friends, saying they were merely “acquainted”. Hancock has refused to be drawn on the nature of his relationship with Bourne, who ran a village pub close to his former constituency home. ‘Matt Hancock – never heard of him’ The WhatsApp exchange seen by the Guardian took place on 25 November, the day before the newspaper published its first story about the pair. Both had been asked questions about the nature of their relationship and whether Bourne had received any preferential treatment. At 3.38pm, Hancock wrote to Bourne: “Apparently we are appearing in the Guardian together tomorrow. I am accused of – shock horror – having your phone number. Apologies in advance for this uninvited publicity. What a rag.” Seven minutes later, Bourne replied: “Matt Hancock – never heard of him. We managed to get the chain of events on how we ended up supplying NHS along with supporting evidence that shows you were nothing to do with us.” Referring to a London law firm he had hired to deal with inquiries from a female reporter, Bourne added: “I’ve got Carter-Ruck all over her like a [t]ramp on chips. No apology necessary, I’m sorry I’ve implicated you in something by association.” The phrase “like a tramp on chips” is offensive slang that means with the enthusiasm that a hungry homeless person would approach discarded food.    WhatsApp messages between Matt Hancock and Alex Bourne. Composite: The Guardian   The law firm Carter-Ruck promises to help clients deal with “unwanted media interest”, claiming on its website that it has an “unrivalled track record in using its legal and strategic expertise to prevent the publication of adverse and intrusive articles”. It remains unclear precisely how Hinpack came to be selected as a major supplier of medical devices to the NHS – or exactly how often Bourne and Hancock have communicated with each other. When first asked in November, Carter-Ruck flatly denied that Bourne had any discussions with Hancock in relation to Covid supplies. Bourne later backtracked, conceding he had in fact exchanged text and email messages with the health secretary over several months. According to Bourne, after sending Hancock the initial WhatsApp message in March 2020, he formally submitted details of the work Hinpack could do on a DHSC website for prospective suppliers. Bourne’s lawyers said he sent Hancock another WhatsApp message on 4 April, to which the health secretary did not respond. Around mid-April Bourne said VWR, a distributor of medical products that had a framework agreement to supply the NHS, called him. After several conversations, VWR ended up asking Bourne to supply test tubes for the NHS. Bourne’s lawyers said he sent Hancock another private message on 14 May, informing him he had won a contract. Since early autumn, Bourne has been supplying test tubes via Alpha Laboratories, another medical distributor with a pre-existing contract to supply the NHS. Hinpack is specified as the sole subcontractor in one £40m contract between DHSC and Alpha Laboratories. Bourne’s lawyers say he has not sought to avoid scrutiny of his contacts with Hancock, and said that after every exchange he sent the DHSC a note to ensure there was a record of their conversation. However, responding to a recent freedom of information request for the dates of their communications last year, the DHSC said its records showed Bourne and Hancock had communicated only once – on 25 August. It made no mention of the numerous WhatsApp messages between the two in March, April, May and November, or other communications believed to have taken place in June and September. Although only a subcontractor, Bourne has had repeated direct communications with DHSC officials. Several sources have said Bourne regularly boasted about his close relationship with Hancock in conversations with those officials, as well as business partners and employees. Other sources have described Bourne and Hancock as “friends” and “buddies”. His lawyers described allegations that he had boasted about his relationship with Hancock as “unsubstantiated embroidery”. Rachel Reeves, the shadow Cabinet Office minister, said: “The health secretary has some extremely serious questions to answer here. The government must urgently investigate these utterly shocking messages.” Faulty test tubes Meanwhile, there are mounting questions about Bourne’s capacity to supply safe and reliable vials to the NHS. In December a DHSC report recorded the results of checks on 11,000 Hinpack test tubes due to be assembled into kits for the public. Sterile and leakproof test tubes are an essential component as they are used to securely transport swabs to laboratories. Remarkably, the DHSC report, seen by the Guardian, noted that all 11,000 were faulty, being either cracked, broken, scratched or with missing or poorly screwed caps. After the checks, Bourne recalled his supplies – at least 8m test tubes – from warehouses and agreed to quarantine them. Hinpack’s consultant quality manager, Michał Kisiel, who is based in Poland, told the Guardian that Bourne had recalled his stock from NHS logistics hubs because tubes did not pass pressure tests, meaning they could not be guaranteed as leakproof. “DHSC asked for tubes that pass this test. If they contain swabs from patients, they must not leak,” he said. Previously, Bourne’s lawyers had said the medical devices produced by Hinpack were “by no means complicated and are well within our client’s existing skillset”. They said the recent recall of millions of vials was caused by DHSC changing the product specification. A government source said that after Hinpack’s recall of test tubes, a site visit was conducted and the company had provided all of the necessary evidence that appropriate processes “are now in place” to ensure products meet the necessary standards. DHSC is rolling back its orders for the Covid test programme and, as part of that, it is understood to be seeking a dramatic reduction in the number of Hinpack vials ordered through Alpha Laboratories, requesting a cut in volume of up to 75% on a £40m order placed in December. Substantial numbers of Hinpack’s plastic test tubes are alleged to have been burned in recent months without a licence at various properties to which Bourne had access, including in his own garden. The Guardian has seen evidence of one such fire, with test tubes scattered around the base of a fire sending huge plumes of black smoke into the sky. The Suffolk fire service had to attend another outdoor fire at Bourne’s home to extinguish it on 2 January. Bourne’s lawyers said it was “untrue” that Hinpack test tubes had been disposed of in unlicensed fires. They said the 2 January incident at Bourne’s property was related to “a mistaken burning of domestic carpet underlay”.  Do you have information about this story? Email felicity.lawrence@theguardian.com, or (using a non-work phone) use Signal or WhatsApp to message +44 7584 640566  Last month the Guardian revealed that Bourne’s company was under investigation by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) over allegations relating to hygiene standards. Bourne’s lawyers denied allegations of hygiene failures and said their client was unaware of the investigation by the regulator. They said he “very much regrets” his choice of language in his WhatsApp message and had no desire to stifle proper factual reporting. A DHSC spokesperson stressed Hinpack does not have a “direct” contract with the government and said “claims that ministers were directly involved in procurement decisions or contract management are false”. The spokesperson said the impartiality and integrity of government procurement “is taken extremely seriously”. Hancock declined to comment. When asked about Bourne’s work at a Downing Street press conference in December, Hancock replied: “I had absolutely nothing to do with that contract.” In February, when the health secretary gave TV interviews from his constituency home, viewers spotted a photograph of Bourne’s pub on his wall. The photo has since been removed.    A picture of Bourne’s pub, the Cock Inn, is seen on the wall behind Hancock. Composite: Handouts   In a statement, Alpha Laboratories distanced itself from the recall of vials, which happened at the behest of Hinpack. “We have a rigorous quality management system and within this have a robust product recall system which thankfully has been rarely used.” It said its quality system received no details of quality issues relating to tubes supplied by Hinpack. VWR confirmed it had previously supplied Hinpack test tubes to the NHS but no longer did, and declined to comment on how the business had come about.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'Norton Juster obituary',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Norton Juster, who has died aged 91, wrote The Phantom Tollbooth, which became a classic for children of all ages. It tells the story of a boy named Milo, who is both bored and boring. One day he finds a package in his bedroom, from which he assembles the flat-packed eponymous tollbooth, and through which he proceeds in his toy electric car. He finds himself enmeshed in an ongoing conflict between Azaz the king of Dictionopolis and his brother the Mathemagician, ruler of Digitopolis. Tasked with rescuing the princesses Rhyme and Reason, Milo – accompanied by Tock, a watchdog who sports an alarm clock on his torso – begins an epic journey through a world filled with wordplay. Juster recalled his own childhood, in which he experienced synaesthesia. “I couldn’t do numbers if I didn’t see colours,” he explained, and in many ways his writing is about translating things differently from what may have been intended. As Milo learned: “So many things are possible just as long as you don’t know they’re impossible.” It was 1961, and The Phantom Tollbooth was like a child’s antidote to the drab 1950s; Milo could be a younger version of Holden Caulfield who discovers a world with which he can be involved. It might also be seen as an American version of Alice in Wonderland, though where Alice delves into Lewis Carroll’s deep Victorian unconscious, Juster’s Milo is a child having his consciousness unlocked. Juster always denied the influence; instead he said his book was inspired by his father’s incessant punning and his familiarity with Marx Brothers movies. “They were absolutely insane … and then you’d see them again and again and you realise they made all this good sense,” he said.    The Phantom Tollbooth was published in 1961. Photograph: AP   Juster was born in Brooklyn, New York. His parents, Samuel, an architect, and Minnie (nee Silberman), were immigrants from Romania. Despite the punning, and his great love of literature, Norton was expected to follow his older brother into his father’s trade. He took a degree in architecture from the University of Pennsylvania and then studied city planning on a Fulbright grant at Liverpool University. After his return to the US, he was drafted into the navy, spending three years as an engineer, and winding up at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. After his discharge he eventually founded his own architectural firm, and won a Ford Foundation grant to write a book about urban perceptions. Procrastinating on that project, he began jotting down notes about Milo’s story. It might have never been more, but one night, taking out the trash at his Brooklyn duplex, he met his upstairs neighbour, the cartoonist Jules Feiffer. “We started exchanging wisecracks,” Feiffer recalled. Juster showed Feiffer his story, and Feiffer began drawing illustrations. Juster began writing things more and more difficult to illustrate; Feiffer retaliated by drawing Juster into the story as The Whether Man. But it was Feiffer’s wife, Judith, who took the book to Jason Epstein at Random House; Epstein was not a children’s editor, and he saw past the standard evaluations. “Everybody said this is not a children’s book,” Juster explained. “The wordplay, and the punning; they will never understand.” But of course children did, and what we didn’t understand at first, we understood the next time we read it, or the next. Sparked by a favourable review in the New York Times, the book became a bestseller. Juster followed in 1963 with The Dot and the Line: A Romance In Lower Mathematics, about a line who discovers his own ability to illustrate quadratics and wins the dot away from the anarchic Squiggle. As Juster wrote: “To the vector belongs the spoils.” In 1965 it became an Oscar-winning short film, narrated by Robert Morley and co-directed by Maurice Noble and Chuck Jones, best known for Looney Tunes’ Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck, who revel in their own wordplay. In 1970, Jones co-wrote and co-directed a full-length version of The Phantom Tollbooth, featuring the voices of Mel Blanc, June Foray, Daws Butler and Hans Conried. Its remarkable animation includes Milo’s drive through the Doldrums, where the Lethargians melt round his car like Dalì watches. In 1964, Juster married Jeanne Ray, a graphic designer. He was also teaching at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, along with Earl Pope, his partner in their architectural firm. In 1970 they moved to Massachusetts, to join the founding faculty at Hampshire College, an experimental liberal arts college started by four institutions – the University of Massachusetts, and Amherst, Smith and Mount Holyoke Colleges – based in the area. Juster would teach there for 20 years, though he could be very critical of the educational process. “It’s really the appearance ... and credentials of education they’re worried about. I think at birth they should give every child a PhD.” His firm, which became Juster Pope Frazier, designed buildings on those campuses, as well as the Eric Carle Museum of Picture Book Art in Amherst; Carle illustrated Juster’s Otter Nonsense (1982). His other children’s books include Alberic the Wise (1965), illustrated by Domenico Gnoli, As Silly As Knees, As Busy As Bees (1989), for which the illustrator Chris Raschka won a Caldecott medal, and its sequel, Sourpuss and Sweetiepie (2008). In 2010, he and Feiffer reunited to produce a tale of bullying, The Odious Ogre. But the legacy of The Phantom Tollbooth just grew. In 2011, Leonard Marcus edited an annotated version; in 2012 a documentary film, The Phantom Tollbooth: Beyond Expectations, appeared. In 2017, a stage musical debuted in Washington DC. Each generation had its eyes opened, and parents would again revel in the advice of the Terrible Trivium: “If you only do the easy and useless jobs, you’ll never have to worry about the important ones that are so difficult.” Adults going back to it would discover new relevance. “Everybody is so terribly sensitive about the things they know best,” seems particularly apt for the social media age. Jeanne died in 2018. Norton is survived by their daughter, Emily, and a granddaughter. Feiffer remembered Juster as his “oldest friend” and said that their “wisecracks never improved or diminished”. • Norton Juster, writer and architect, born 2 June 1929; died 8 March 2021\\n',\n",

       "  'full_article': \"Football supporters from across Europe have added to the growing concern over Champions League reforms, claiming proposed expansion will “cement the dominance of elite clubs in perpetuity”. With just weeks to go before Uefa executives are expected to decide on their Horizon 24 proposals, which would add four more Champions League matchdays and allow clubs to qualify based on historic performance in Europe, there is a late attempt to push back against the changes by those who feel their voices have been ignored.   Related: Champions League expansion could be ‘devastating’, warns Palace's Parish   Among them are the people who, in non-pandemic times, fill the continent’s stadiums. On Thursday the umbrella body Football Supporters Europe published a 24-page manifesto critiquing Uefa’s current proposals and making recommendations to, it says , “ensure that clubs and communities from across the continent enjoy a fair share” of the game’s economic growth. “Proposals to reform or replace Uefa club competitions by expanding the Uefa Champions League or establishing a breakaway super league are flawed,” the FSE argue in their “position paper” on reform. “If realised, they will further undermine the … core principles of sporting merit. “More specifically, the evidence suggests that adding more clubs and games to European competitions will increase inequality between and within domestic leagues, cement the dominance of elite clubs in perpetuity, and make for less entertaining football in the long run.” Citing, among other voices, the Guardian’s former football correspondent Arthur Hopcraft, the FSE build together a picture of how proposed changes have, over the years, reduced the centrality of supporters to the sport. It also makes a series of recommendations that would make the game “more European, more diverse, and more open”. Among the commitments would be an acknowledgment of the “central importance of domestic competitions in the football pyramid” and “the contributions made by supporters to European football”.   The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.  Recommended changes include preventing “further fragmentation of the matchday calendar”, a “more equitable distribution of revenue between participating clubs” in European competition and a “dramatic increase in solidarity payments to benefit non-participating clubs”. “The process of devising such proposals should begin and end with consultation and cooperation between all stakeholders, including supporters, at both European and national levels,” the paper concludes. “In the end, dialogue presents the best chance to build a game that works for everybody.”\\n\",\n",

       "  'title': 'The Guardian view on violence against women: without safety, there can be no equality | Editorial',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'The last day or so has seen an outpouring of grief and anger over the disappearance of Sarah Everard, who vanished last week as she walked home in Clapham, south London. A serving Metropolitan police officer has now been arrested on suspicion of her kidnapping and murder. Cressida Dick, the Met commissioner, told reporters: “It is thankfully incredibly rare for a woman to be abducted from our streets. I completely understand that despite this, women in London and the wider public – particularly those in the area where Sarah went missing – will be worried and may well be feeling scared.” As her remarks suggest, the case has sparked a potent reaction. For many women, it has tapped into far broader concerns about the abuse and violence they face. Six women and a little girl have been reported as killed since Sarah Everard went missing, noted Jess Phillips, Labour’s shadow minister for domestic violence. Harassment and assault by men are anything but rare. It is more than 40 years since the first Reclaim the Night march, which was prompted by the Yorkshire Ripper murders and the police response, telling women to stay at home after dark. Now a Reclaim These Streets vigil is to be held in Clapham on Saturday. Women are exhausted. The frustration and rage vented on social media and in parliament is the product of a society where it is normal for women to live in fear. This week, a survey for UN Women UK found that almost all young women in the UK – 97% of 18- to 24-year-olds – have been sexually harassed; almost none reported it. Almost every woman has tales of encounters ranging from verbal abuse to physical assaults – often dating back to her childhood. While women of all ages are at risk of violence, girls and young women appear especially vulnerable to male violence in public places. Women spend their lives planning routes, clenching keys and readying themselves to run. But online, many also recounted lists of what they do not do, from visiting friends once the sun has set to walking alone in the countryside – trading freedom for safety, in the words of Professor Liz Kelly, an expert on violence against women. “We do safety work all the time and it costs us – our time, our imaginations, our space to experience joy, our embodiment,” she wrote. Yet women cannot keep themselves safe by staying at home: on average, two a week in England and Wales are killed by abusive partners or ex-partners – and the numbers are feared to have risen since the pandemic began. As new realms open up, women’s freedoms are curtailed there too. Online threats and harassment are rife. There is real cause for concern that extreme online content is spilling over into offline life. We teach girls to shrink their lives, while doing too little to educate boys and men not only to respect women, but also to challenge those who do not do so. Sexual harassment may come at one end of the spectrum of male threat, but it creates a climate in which women feel unsafe and predatory men are emboldened. The government should consider a street harassment law like that introduced in France. But its priority must be turning around the dismal record on tackling violence. Rape prosecutions have dropped every year since 2016-17 – more than halving in that time – and are now at a record annual low. The number of domestic abuse prosecutions fell by almost a quarter in the last three months of 2019. Slashed funding has closed refuges across the country. The cash promised in the budget is a fraction of what is needed. Years of work have delivered precious victories. This week, the House of Lords backed amendments to the domestic abuse bill that create statutory defences for women driven to offend. Much more still needs to be done. Women cannot be equal if we cannot feel safe. And we cannot achieve that alone.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': \"The Guardian view on cricket's dilemma: deciding to pitch fast or slow | Editorial\",\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Joe Root, captain of the England cricket team, said his side had to “learn from the challenges” of playing in India after their chastening Test series defeat earlier this month. He put a brave face on a crushing disappointment. This should have been a wonderful series, but as with so much sport at the moment, Covid put paid to that. Being in a bubble and having to play four Tests in rapid succession are not conducive to proper sporting contests. England were undone by a rather ham-fisted squad rotation system that saw key players coming and going at regular intervals. The idea is well-meaning – England have an impossibly demanding schedule this year and fear player burnout – but the policy was disrespectful to India, currently the world’s strongest cricketing nation. England have said that they might resort to rotation again during the series against Australia in the winter, but will they really? One feels that the series against India is seen as a rung below an Ashes tour: an outdated view now that India are so compelling. Mr Root’s pleasingly counterintuitive big idea is to make English domestic cricket more boring by giving extra bonus points to teams that manage to eke out a draw. Forget the gung-ho, win-at-all-costs mentality long espoused by England; bat long and bowl tight is now Mr Root’s mantra. Geoffrey Boycott, that stubborn occupier of the crease, will be delighted. Mr Root reckons the pitches in the county championship are too helpful for the medium-pace trundlers who have always been the backbone of the English first-class game, and wants better wickets that encourage out-and-out fast bowlers and spinners. It was India’s spin supremacy that was the difference in the Test series. Mr Root’s notions are eminently sensible. Traditionally, Test batsmen have learned to play big innings, and bowlers have developed a bit of mystery in the county championship – the long form of the game beloved of cricketing purists. The problem, though, is that those four-day games will henceforth be relegated to the beginning and end of the season: fresh spring and dewy autumn – when conditions favour the sort of English-style seam bowlers who would rarely do much damage on a benign Test match pitch. This summer will be given over largely to one-day cricket, in particular the launch of The Hundred, the controversial attempt to compete with the razzmatazz of the Indian Premier League. English cricket needs a rethink and overhaul, not least when there appears to be a longstanding failure to address institutional racism. But it is also being pulled in two directions: between the playing needs of the Test team and the perceived financial needs of the game more widely. Long-form cricketers will not be developed amid the pyrotechnics of The Hundred. A quick 30 could win a match in the latter; in Test cricket batsmen need to be capable of scoring double-hundreds. England will resume their battle with India on Friday, with a fresh set of personnel and playing the Twenty20 format in which they currently lead the international rankings. They are unlikely to crumble as they did in the Test matches, but the conundrum for English cricket is that privileging this form of the game may be damaging the Test team. Twenty20 and the new-fangled Hundred may be delightful desserts, but what about the main course?\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'This week has shown us how far feminism still has to go | Gaby Hinsliff',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Sometimes you don’t forget a face. And all this week, it has been Sarah Everard’s. When she went missing, any woman who has ever walked home alone at night felt that grim, instinctive sense of recognition. Footsteps on a dark street. Keys gripped between your fingers. There but for the grace of God. She was a perfect stranger, someone I have never met nor had any connection with. But half the women I knew were sharing her image on social media feeds, willing her to make it home. Even though we know that home is where women are statistically most at risk. Women who vanish stick in our heads precisely because they are rare. It’s men who are more likely to be killed in public places, invariably by other men; meanwhile two women a week die at the hands of their own partners on average, and mostly nobody hears their names. The Labour MP Jess Phillips, who reads those names out in parliament every year, said on Thursday that by her count, six women and a little girl had been murdered in the days since Sarah Everard had vanished. That doesn’t make one form of violence against women any more or less shocking than another. It just means that misogyny takes many forms; and that our primal fear of it bleeds into everything. It turns what may sometimes seem to men relatively trivial street encounters into something darker. It’s why we’re instinctively frightened of feeling trapped, dependent, with no way out. This hasn’t felt, in short, like a week to hang out the bunting for International Women’s Day. And yet mark it we should, by noting both how far we’ve come and how very far there still is to go. What would a woman born a century ago make of this world now? Thanks to the feminist icon Betty Friedan, I’ve been wrestling with that question all week. The Feminine Mystique, her great roar of fury against the lies American women had been sold, was republished this week as an ebook. All the better to reach a new millennial audience to whom she is mostly familiar as the character Tracey Ullman played with gusto in the drama series Mrs America; spiky, difficult, brilliant but flawed. I was asked to write an introduction for it and, since Friedan is no longer alive to do the book tour, the publishers have had to make do with me. Stepping briefly into her shoes was mildly terrifying, but what interviewers generally seemed to want to know was whether the high priestess of second-wave feminism would view the present condition of women with elation or despair. What would she make of Meghan, a duchess trapped in what, by her own description of it, might as well be a 1950s housewife’s stifled life? Where would she stand on trans rights? Would she think we’d moved mountains since 1963, when the book was originally published – a world where she could be fired with no right of redress for getting pregnant, and had no legal right to abortion – or be appalled at how much hadn’t changed? The America she wrote about is a distant country now, a world of suburban female desperation slowly unfurling behind closed doors. Women had been told the path to true happiness lay in finding a man, having babies, and then settling down to a life of contentedly sewing their own curtains. Well, Friedan’s book blew that idea sky-high, revealing the frustration, misery and rage seething beneath the surface of housewives’ supposedly idyllic lives. She carried her reporter’s notebook into privileged neighbourhoods where doctors were dishing out antidepressants like sweeties, and diagnosed in these women not neurosis but the pressing need for a job and life of their own. True, in parts the book shows its age now; some of the language is frankly homophobic and the argument revolves chiefly around the lives of white, middle-class women who could afford not to work, not the millions who had no choice. But to re-read it trapped at home by lockdown, an experience that turned back the clock for too many women but particularly for those with abusive partners, was to feel it come alive again. In the book she boggles at how easily the suffragettes’ gains were rolled back, as their daughters’ generations were persuaded that all the battles had been won; that there was something dreary and old-fashioned now about those first-wave feminists, and that therefore they could relax. Her warning never to get that complacent again feels fiercely contemporary now. Even Betty Friedan struggled sometimes, as the Duchess of Sussex might say, to speak her own truth. The book and the movement it unleashed made her a household name. But what she didn’t reveal at the time was that while her public career was taking off, her marriage was violently unravelling. Before she went on television to bang the drum for women’s liberation, she would sometimes have to cover bruises with makeup. Yet she agonised in private about whether getting a divorce might somehow undermine the message, playing into her critics’ charge that feminists were bitter women who had somehow failed at life. Even after the autobiography in which she spoke candidly about all this came out, her by then ex-husband Carl insisted he wasn’t a wife-beater, that they’d both lashed out; and for whatever reasons Friedan herself downplayed the issue in subsequent interviews. For the author of myth-shattering books to shatter the myth of her own supposedly happy family life proved unexpectedly hard. I genuinely don’t know what she would have made of Harry and Meghan, publicly ripping plasters off raw wounds in a way that also now feels as if it may be unlocking something bigger. But I think she would have known exactly what to make of those two women who still, on average, die every week at the hands of abusive partners, and of the 50% of young men who nonetheless tell surveys that feminism has somehow gone “too far”. So what I do want to celebrate this week is difficult women. The flawed ones, the spiky ones, the ones you may not even like, but who have something awkwardly necessary to say. (Odd how it’s millennial snowflakes who are accused of running away from challenging ideas, yet it was Piers Morgan who stormed off air rather than accept that a duchess he finds irritating might still have a point.) The young and the righteous, of course, but also the older ones who don’t always get so much airtime and have lost the patience to tiptoe around the issue. And perhaps, above all, the ones who have been banging on about the same old things for decades now, but only because the same old things haven’t changed fast enough, and women still keep dying of them.

Odey, who was 39 at the time of the alleged assault, nodded briefly at the district judge on Thursday after being read the verdict, which found him not guilty of one count of indecent assault. While the hedge fund manager admitted he raised the possibility of sleeping with the woman, then in her mid-20s, he denied the charge. District judge Nicholas Rimmer said there were “inconsistencies” in the woman’s account of the incident. Returning his verdict at Westminster magistrates court on Thursday, Rimmer said: “I am left unsure of [the complainant’s account] because despite the strength of her emotion and tears, her credibility has been thrown into question and her evidence is riddled with troubling inconsistencies.” He added: “Where there is any doubt in a criminal case, given the high standard of proof, it must be resolved in favour of the defendant. I cannot dismiss the possibility that no more than your unwanted verbal advance or proposition to the complainant occurred on the evening in question.” Giving evidence in his defence, Odey admitted he propositioned the woman after she asked where “this is going to end”, by replying: “If you’re lucky, it might end up in the bed.” However, he has denied any physical contact with the woman. Under cross examination in February, the complainant said she was groped in a “octopussy-type manoeuvre”. She sent an email to Odey in 2013 about the incident, in which she referred to him as a “sleazy, deceitful man who likes to prey on the innocence of young women”. The complainant went to the police in 2017 in the wake of the #MeToo movement. The Tory donor and founder of Odey Asset Management has accused the woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, of “exaggerating, massively” in her account of what happened. Odey is known for earning £28m after successfully predicting the 2008 credit crunch, and for donating over £870,000 to pro-leave groups before the Brexit campaign. He placed huge bets against the pound and government bonds in the runup to the EU referendum and made an estimated £220m profit when the pound collapsed following the leave victory. He stepped down from Odey Asset Management, the company he founded in 1991, in November, saying he would focus on managing his own funds.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'English council funding: a crisis that’s been years in the making | Letters',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Local government funding in England has been in crisis for years (Covid has exposed dire position of England’s local councils, 10 March), as successive governments have taken ever more power away. Its finances have been the victim of the totally inadequate council tax for decades, and an ever-reducing central grant. In addition, for a number of years, most councils accepted the government’s “council tax freeze grant”, effectively a bribe not to raise council tax rather than face a local referendum if they did. As a result, the county council of which I was a member during that period stopped being a provider and became a “commissioner” of what services survived. It saw its staff reduced by nearly two-thirds over a five-year period. Had it not taken the freeze grant but raised its share of council tax by 2% per year, my council would have been better off by around £40m. Local government still has the ability to deliver, but it needs urgent reform, so let’s start by replacing council tax with something more progressive and then complete the transformation of the first tier of local government in England into the unitary format.John MarriottNorth Hykeham, Lincolnshire • The government is mean about funding local government, particularly Labour councils. But one thing it could do at very little cost is relieve councils of debt, which would remove the burden of annual repayments. Around 75% of council borrowing comes from the Public Works Loan Board and the maximum amount that the government can lend this way is £95bn. It is funded through the issuing of public bonds via the Debt Management Office. That means the government could buy back these bonds through the Bank of England and wipe off PWLB debt at a stroke. This is what happened in 2012, when it used quantitative easing to buy back £375bn of bonds held by banks to improve their liquidity. Even if the government reduced the PWLB by half, for a city like Liverpool this would reduce annual repayments by around £15m and provide millions of pounds of extra borrowing capacity that can be used for housing and other infrastructure investment. And it would cost the government nothing. Barry KushnerLabour councillor, Liverpool city council • Your excellent editorial (9 March) praising public spaces misses one key point. There is indeed a need for more “serious investment in the civic spaces that define a community’s sense of itself”. But the harm is also in the austerity cuts in routine spending on those spaces, which councillors like myself struggle with. It’s about commonplace neighbourhood services – street cleaning, mending pavements, looking after parks properly, tackling antisocial behaviour including a return of youth services, refuse collection, pest control, traffic management, street lighting, community policing, public lavatories, and all the rest. High-profile, expensive services such as adult and children’s care, major highways, fire and police are vital, but it’s the local neighbourhood services that are most forgotten and which matter so much. These are often run by district councils – or town and parish councils – which are left out of government funding.Tony Greaves Liberal Democrat, House of Lords • Re local government funding, obvious but unremarked correlations warrant comment. You report that at least 25 councils face bankruptcy and that the government spent £22bn on private test-and-trace contracts (No evidence £22bn test-and-trace scheme cut Covid rates in England, say MPs, 10 March). What a shame that money is not available to support councils – a billion each for 22 of them would more than meet their needs. It might even enable them to carry out the public health role they were landed with after the 2012 Health and Social Care Act, and deal more effectively with future coronavirus-like crises. Alongside this, disputes about the NHS pay rise make no mention of the urgent need to reinstate nurse training bursaries, iniquitously removed in 2017, an act of vandalism that goes some way to explaining nurse shortages.Anne LeonardYork\\n',\n",

       "  'full_article': 'Dr Frances Holliss takes a very rosy view of homeworking (Letters, 9 March) and ignores the mental health effects of isolation on many people – especially over such a long period. The Centre for Mental Health has estimated that up to 10 million people in England may need support for their mental health as a result of the pandemic. And the social isolation – increased by homeworking – has been a major factor in this. Sadly, the mental health effects of the pandemic and lockdown have been largely ignored by politicians and scientists. Flexible working is a positive development for many people, but the danger is that people will be forced into homeworking as companies seek to cut costs and reduce their office space. And the mental health effects of isolation will be severe for very many people. There is a danger that we are sleepwalking into dramatic societal changes that could have very negative consequences because of ignorance of the mental health implications. Mark Dawes Leytonstone, London • Research may suggest that many people like homeworking. However, I think Dr Holliss oversimplifies the case. She mentions the advantages of being able to decide “when and how to work”. As an academic, prescribed teaching and meeting times means, for much of the job, I don’t decide when to work, and the “how” is severely circumscribed by the dictates of Teams, Zoom etc; and other jobs may be more prescriptive. I may be in a minority, but as I grow sick of the sight of my study walls and miss the company of colleagues, homeworking has become largely a negative experience.

We know that long Covid is more than one disease, all of which will need different treatments.

       "  'title': \"High court rejects bid to extend UK's EU settlement scheme\",\n",
       "  'full_article': 'The high court has rejected a legal bid for an extension to the EU settlement scheme (EUSS), dismissing campaigners’ concerns that those EU residents who fail to apply to remain in the UK before July could face “devastating” consequences, similar to those experienced by the Windrush generation. Legal action mounted by the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants called for the Home Office to extend the deadline to ensure that those who miss the 30 June cut-off date do not become undocumented and liable to detention and removal. “On 1 July 2021 anyone who has yet to apply, or apply successfully, will be left without immigration status and exposed to the consequences of the hostile environment; at risk of losing their jobs, homes, access to benefits, and healthcare, driving licences, detention, criminalisation and removal – a second Windrush, but on a much bigger scale,” Paul Bowen QC for the JCWI told the court. During a permission hearing, lawyers for the JCWI said the home secretary had failed to collect enough data to ensure adequate action was being taken to encourage vulnerable groups to apply before the deadline. “In the absence of that data she is pressing a policy outcome which is highly likely to have severe discriminatory consequences: she is driving blind towards the cliff-edge,” Bowen said. Some groups of people are thought to be less likely to have applied for EUSS by the June deadline – particularly older EU residents, children, physically or mentally disabled individuals, women in relationships involving domestic abuse or Roma people, the court heard. However, rejecting the request for a judicial review, Justice Nathalie Lieven said it was the nature of all application schemes that there needed to be a deadline, and noted the Home Office’s argument that there would be a period of grace for those people who could show that they had reasonable grounds for making a late application. The details of how long that period will last, and how the exemptions will be implemented, have yet to be published. By the end of December 2020 4.9 million applications to the scheme had been received, and 4.6 million people had been granted permission to remain in the UK; 54% of them were granted permanent status, and 43% were given the more temporary pre-settled status. The JCWI acknowledged that the vast majority of applicants have experienced little difficulty, but said some groups were likely to find the process more challenging, and are more likely to see their applications fail.  The charity accepted that the Home Office had taken some steps to avert the discriminatory consequences of the policy, but stated that without attempting to get more data to establish how many people are struggling to apply, there is “no way of knowing whether those steps are adequate”. The Home Office has acknowledged that certain groups will find it more difficult, such as women in controlling or coercive relationships, children and those who lack the physical or mental capacity to apply, but David Blundell QC, acting for the department, said that steps had been taken to encourage applications from those groups. Satbir Singh, the chief executive of the JCWI, said: “We are deeply disappointed at today’s decision. The fact remains that in June, tens of thousands of EU citizens are at risk of falling through the gaps and being made undocumented. They will then be subject to the same hostile environment which has already ruined the lives of countless people, including the Windrush generation. “Boris Johnson and Priti Patel promised that all EU citizens would get an automatic right to stay in the UK. Not only have they broken that promise, they have created a scheme which discriminates against older people, disabled people, looked-after children and many others. The government must do the right thing and lift the June deadline.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “There have been 4.6 million grants of status under the EU Settlement Scheme already, securing people’s rights in UK law. The scheme is simple and straightforward, with a wide range of support available online, over the phone and in person for those who have questions or need help applying. We continue to work closely with employers, local authorities and charities to raise awareness of the scheme and we continue to encourage EU citizens to apply.”\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'Glasgow’s miles better than this portrayal of a hopeless, dying city | Letter',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'While I am glad that the recent photo essay on Glasgow’s excess mortality blamed it on the city’s housing policy and not its people, I was saddened to see how the piece presented a wholly negative view of the city (The Glasgow Effect: examining the city’s life expectancy gap – a photo essay, 26 February). For the vast majority, life in Glasgow is not a grim death sentence. The city is Scotland’s largest urban economy and its base for arts and media. Glasgow is home to three universities, one of the world’s most prestigious art schools and – in the west and south – some of the UK’s most culturally vibrant and bourgeois districts outside London. This does not detract from Glasgow’s appalling social inequalities, but it is far from the hopeless, dying city portrayed in the article. It must be noted that while Glasgow city council has Scotland’s lowest life expectancies, Scotland’s two council areas with highest life expectancy, East Renfrewshire and East Dunbartonshire, both fall within Greater Glasgow. They are home to 203,000 people and both begin just a couple of miles from the city centre yet are excluded from Glasgow’s demographic data. This counterpoint rarely makes its way into media portrayals of the city. Lastly, there is the loaded term of the “Glasgow effect” itself. The Glasgow Centre for Population Health, whose use of the phrase in the title of a 2010 report, now discourages its use as the mystery surrounding excess mortality has been solved. There is no “Glasgow effect”, only a policy effect that has left long-lasting damage. Glasgow is undergoing an unprecedented level of development, socially and commercially. The article’s lopsided portrayal of the city will only add to the social apartheid it discusses and deter tourism and investment. There is much more to Glasgow than ill health and desolation. I hope future Guardian coverage of the city reflects this. Gavin Moffat Cumbernauld, North Lanarkshire\\n',\n",

       "  'full_article': 'A convicted armed robber who strangled, battered and stabbed a woman to death after meeting her on a dating site has been sentenced to life in prison. Martin Saberi, 55, murdered Amy Griffiths in her flat in Droitwich Spa, Worcestershire, in January 2019 while he was on the run for stabbing another woman in the neck outside a supermarket near his home in Wallington, Surrey, three days earlier. Saberi, who at the time of the attacks was out on licence after serving 16 years for robbery, was jailed for life with a minimum term of 24 years and 10 months, after which he will be almost 80. Worcester crown court heard that Saberi attacked 51-year-old Griffiths with a baseball bat, strangled her and stabbed her in the neck before stealing her laptop and Xbox and travelling to London where he handed himself in to police a few hours later. The judge James Burbidge QC said: “There are a number of aggravating factors – Amy was killed in her own home and when you left her dead you stole some of her belongings – a despicable act. The violence you engaged in was extreme.” The prosecutor Rachel Brand QC told the court how on 11 January 2019 Saberi stabbed a 59-year-old woman, the mother of his friend’s ex-partner, in the neck outside a shop after a drinking session. The victim recovered but was told by hospital staff she was “lucky and could have died”. The next day Saberi messaged Griffiths to tell her he was coming to visit and travelled up to her housing association flat in Droitwich, a visit that came as a surprise to the victim. Brand said Saberi and Griffiths had met online via a transgender dating site and had met in person only once before, in June 2018, but had exchanged numerous messages over a period of months that appeared to show an affectionate relationship. Griffiths is believed to have been killed during the night of 13-14 January, with neighbours hearing some loud noises coming from the flat in the early hours. Saberi, who is said to have a number of mental health conditions including post-traumatic stress disorder and personality disorder, appeared at the sentencing hearing via video link from the high-security Broadmoor hospital in Berkshire. The judge said he accepted mental illness was a factor in the killing but “whether it was a significant factor is difficult to determine”. He said there was no suggestion “this was a murder aggravated by hostility towards the deceased because of her transgender identity”. Saberi had a string of previous convictions for violent crimes, starting with an indecent assault on a woman in 1993, and in 2000 was sentenced to life imprisonment for a robbery where he entered a jewellery shop posing as a customer and threatened staff with a gun. Saberi initially pleaded not guilty to the murder before switching to a guilty plea on the day his trial was due to begin in February. Griffiths was described by friends as a “hero” in the local LGBT+ community. DCI Carl Moore, of West Mercia police’s major investigations unit, said: “Martin Saberi is very obviously a dangerous and violent individual and today’s sentence reflects the horrific nature of both offences he pleaded guilty to, in which he attacked two women with a knife in completely unprovoked and unforgivable incidents. “Amy was a much-loved, much-respected person who so many people have spoken warmly of and I know she is deeply missed by those whose lives she touched.”\\n',\n",

       "  'full_article': 'A group of teenagers who live in some of London’s most polluted neighbourhoods are putting “hacked” road signs up across the capital to highlight the disproportionate impact that toxic air has on people of colour. Choked Up, a group who describe themselves as “black and brown teenagers from south London”, have set up the campaign, which is being backed by more than 100 doctors.  Anjali Raman-Middleton, 17, a co-founder of the group, went to primary school with Ella Kissi-Debrah, who died in 2013 as a result of London’s air pollution crisis. “I’m terrified that my daily commute to school along the South Circular has already had a negative impact on my lungs,” she said. “I urge London mayoral candidates to commit to transform these roads to give me and my generation a greener future.”    Choked Up are backed by more than 100 doctors. Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian   The guerrilla road signs read “pollution zone” and warn that “breathing kills”. They come just as new research from the Environmental Defense Fund Europe (EDF) is published showing that London’s poorest areas and black, Asian and minority ethnic communities are hit hardest by the toxic air. A group of 100 London health professionals who work in the NHS have backed the call for action with a letter to the capital’s mayoral candidates, urging them to commit to tackling air pollution inequalities and to develop an “urgent action plan to … reduce our dependence on cars”.   Related: UK has broken air pollution limits for a decade, EU court finds   Levels of air pollution across the capital are “a public health emergency”, according to Dr Laura Jane Smith, a respiratory consultant at King’s College hospital and one of the signatories of the letter organised by Medact. “There are far too many people in our hospital wards and clinics who might otherwise be healthy if it wasn’t for the toxic air they breathe,” Smith said “Air pollution affects every single one of us from birth to old age, but we know the least well off and marginalised communities, including those from black and Asian backgrounds, are being hardest hit.” A growing body of research underlines the devastating impact that air pollution – both indoors and outdoors – is having on the nation’s health. Recent studies suggest it may be damaging every organ in the body, with effects including heart and lung disease, diabetes, dementia, reduced intelligence and increased depression. Children and unborn babies may suffer the most.    Air pollution disproportionately affects minority ethnic communities, campaigners say. Photograph: Choked Up   The EDF study highlighted the uneven impact of air pollution, with nitrogen dioxide (NO2) 24-31% higher in areas of London where people from black, Asian or minority ethnic backgrounds are most likely to live. Additionally, it found the most deprived Londoners are more than six times more likely to live in areas with higher pollution than the least deprived. Choked Up is calling on the mayoral candidates to dramatically improve air quality along the capital’s major roads, the so-called “red routes”, which make up 5% of London’s roads but carry a third of its traffic.    Choked Up co-founders, from left, Nyeleti Brauer-Maxaeia, Anjali Raman-Middleton, Destiny Boka Batesa. Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian   They are calling for a reduction in goods vehicle and private car use, and a renewed focus on “a world-class walking and cycling network, as well as affordable and accessible zero-emission public transport”. Oliver Lord, of EDF, said: “For years, the major ‘red routes’ have been a toxic thread running through our communities, polluting the doorsteps of homes and kids’ playgrounds. We need a green recovery that undoes decades of damage, using a clear traffic reduction plan – one where polluting trucks can no longer cut across the city and parking for cars becomes parks for people.”\\n',\n",

       "  'full_article': 'Women have shared their fears on social media about walking alone at night following the disappearance of Sarah Everard. Five women have spoken about how they feel when finding themselves alone in public spaces after dark. ‘I don’t relax until I reach my destination’ “I am always frightened walking alone at night. I don’t let it stop me but I’m very aware of every person, movement and what could happen. I don’t relax until I reach my destination. “My dad took me for self-defence lessons as a teenager and I still remember much of the advice. It runs through my mind every time I walk somewhere alone at night.  “I always walk with my keys in my hand, the ‘blade’ of a key sticking out so that I can use them as a weapon. I don’t think any of this would stop anything from happening, but I feel more assured having some self-defence skills. “I’ve lived all over the country: in Hackney, before it was gentrified, in Yorkshire, rural Derbyshire and now in the suburbs of Nottingham. I’ve always felt the same though, in all of these places. I’m always aware there is potential danger.” Claire, 42, marketing director, Nottingham ‘It’s difficult for women’ “I’m constantly paranoid about threats and where they may be coming from. I’ve had people suggest using a taxi, like it’s a whole lot safer, but there have been reports of taxi-drivers taking advantage of passengers, like John Worboys, and recent concerns over fake Ubers and such. “Even if you’re with another female friend, you think it might not be enough to deter attackers. Commuting in the dark during the winter months, especially during lockdown. feels particularly dangerous.  “I was commuting into work when I was approached by a man and asked for my phone number. When I declined, he would not leave me alone and followed me on my route into work.  “There was no one around, it was dark, he was a lot bigger than me and walked pretty close to me despite social distancing. I was really scared for my own safety.  “In the end, the only way I could get rid of him was by giving him fake details and making a run for it. I was paranoid for months about bumping into him again and changed my commute routine. “It’s difficult for women. You’re told to be polite and smile and be nice even if you’re feeling threatened. However, smiling and being polite can be an encouragement for harassment and when you decline their advances, the situation often turns nasty.” Lesley*, 24, local government worker, Rotherham ‘My boyfriend will also often meet me at a bus stop if I am heading home’ “Being alone in a public space at night can be terrifying. You simultaneously wish for someone to appear to protect you, but are incredibly fearful that if a person appears they might harm you.  “You walk quickly and alertly, looking around every few seconds to check no one is following you. Any rustling, footsteps, or lone cars can create that adrenaline rush of fear. You push out the thoughts of the worst thing that could happen to you, and concentrate on it being a safe part of the city – many women have safely walked here before and will do so after you. “I tend to phone my boyfriend, or a friend, and have them chat to me on any stretch of dark road. My boyfriend will also often meet me at a bus stop if I am heading home. “I will survey every street and individual before deciding where to go next, and I will stick mainly to well-lit and busy areas. I hold my keys between my knuckles so I can use that as a weapon if necessary.” Zoe, 24, London ‘Having my hand on my phone in my pocket feels like a bit of security’ “Day or night, walking alone causes anxiety, fear, and results in me constantly looking over my shoulder. During lockdown, I’ve steeled myself to take more walks alone during the day but – whether it’s along the river, in a nature reserve or just in the park – that anxiety is always there. I am always alert to any man who is walking behind me, past me or towards me. “Walking alone at night, even in a relatively busy city centre, is something I would try never to do, although during the winter it’s often impossible to avoid when it’s dark around 4pm.  “Maybe my fears are a reaction to growing up in Yorkshire during the [Peter] Sutcliffe years. But those fears are real.  “It’s important to be alert, listen and not wear heels so I can run if necessary. There probably wouldn’t be any time to use it, but having my hand on my phone in my pocket feels like a bit of security.” Elaine, 66, retired, York ‘It’s the everyday things women go through that breeds this fear of being alone at night’ “As a preteen, it frustrated me how my parents prohibited me from walking home alone at night. However, now I’ve come to feel the fear first-hand.  “It’s the everyday things women go through that breeds this fear of being alone at night – catcalls on the street, men twice my age staring, vulgar comments at the pub with my friends. These are things that every woman has experienced, and so, when it comes to being alone in a public space at night, I’ve found I’m naturally more fearful. “Just the thought of walking past a group of men at night is enough to have my heart beating. The sudden realisation of a new shadow in front of me at night has me spinning around – prepared for the worst – only to find it’s the shadow of the lamp-post above me. “Occasionally, I might put my earphones in and play loud music, or a podcast to distract myself. I know this isn’t the safest option because I am making myself more vulnerable to attacks, however it distracts me from my fear. ” Claudia, 19, student, Taunton * Name has been changed\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'Starmer sets off dull and early on his long, lonely march to 6 May | John Crace',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'There’s early and there’s early. The Scottish and Welsh parliamentary elections – along with the English mayoral and local elections – aren’t happening until 6 May but, for reasons best known to themselves, Labour reckoned that early March was the ideal time to start its campaign. Judging by the hourlong launch event, they might be pushing their luck to keep people interested for the best part of two months. The show opened with the deputy leader, Angela Rayner, introducing various videos. First an old black and white clip of a steam train with a shoutout to Harold Wilson – not sure how much name recognition he will get among younger voters – then clips of the new Scottish Labour leader, Anas Sarwar, the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, and several other candidates. The Welsh clip started as a tourist promotional film of the coastal path, complete with melancholy piano soundtrack, and ended with an appearance from the first minister, Mark Drakeford. Rayner tried to sound enthusiastic as she linked the videos, but by the time she had been forced to present the same two postal vote films three or four times each to fill up the dead air, even she had begun to flag somewhat. Her relief when she was allowed to hand over to Keir Starmer, who was giving a live speech from a makeshift studio somewhere in London, was tangible. “After 11 months of talking on Zoom, I’m looking forward to getting out and meeting people,” Starmer said. Just who the Labour leader was expecting to meet was another matter entirely as campaign rallies don’t really square with the government’s roadmap out of lockdown. Unless he is planning to meet the entire country in groups of six come the end of the month.     As expected, Starmer went in hard on the Tories’ pay cut for nurses – he even repeated several of his better lines from the previous day’s prime minister’s questions. I suspect we are going to hear quite a lot about how his mother and sister were both nurses and how his wife works for the NHS in the coming weeks. Though he may need to have a plan B in case Boris Johnson caves in – as many believe he will – and offers nurses an above-inflation pay increase. The Labour leader also tried to remind everyone who was watching – so probably just a few hundred people then, though considerably more than had tuned into the Tory London mayoral hopeful Shaun Bailey’s dismal event earlier in the day – just how badly Johnson had screwed up in the first nine months of his coronavirus response. But Starmer’s heart didn’t really appear to be fully engaged in his speech. Not that he didn’t believe what he was saying, rather that he knew it was going to be an uphill struggle to keep people focused on the elections now that the vaccine programme was proving unexpectedly successful. Everyone had just about had enough and could do with a break from politics. Nor did the questions from the media prove particularly revealing. Other than to highlight that Starmer is just as accomplished at not providing answers when the situation suits him. So we got nothing on the ongoing Harry and Meghan row – William has declared that, on reflection, the royal family isn’t racist, so that’s all sorted then – or on whether he would join nurses on a picket line if they went on strike. Starmer was equally cagey about what would constitute a fair pay rise, saying only that the 2.1% that had been previously agreed and budgeted for would be a good starting point.   Related: Boris Johnson resists calls to correct claim in NHS pay row   “And the final question is from Peter at the Express and Star,” the Labour leader said. Except there was no sign of Peter, who had vanished from his screen. Presumably because he had realised there was little prospect of getting any kind of meaningful response. Starmer looked as relieved as the rest of us felt. Perhaps it was slowly dawning on him that two months of campaigning might just be at least a month too much. Back in the Commons, the main focus of attention was on the Speaker. Fair to say that opposition MPs have been disappointed in Lindsay Hoyle’s indulgence of Johnson over the past year or so, and his reluctance to hold the prime minister to account over his false accusations that Labour had voted against the nurses’ pay rise after the previous day’s PMQs was apparently just the latest sign of weakness. But overnight Hoyle appeared to have had a change of heart as, just before business questions, he made a statement saying ministers should come to the Commons to apologise if they have misled the house. Not that there seems much chance of that happening as Allegra Stratton, the prime minister’s press secretary, was already in the process of embarrassing herself by trying to claim that Johnson had not been referring to the bill that everyone who had heard him had assumed he was. Black was white. It was both absurd and pointless. Though no one should be too surprised by Johnson’s refusal to apologise. He’s never taken any responsibility for his actions, so why break the habit of a lifetime?\\n',\n",

       "  'full_article': \"The Football Association’s head of performance for the women’s game, David Faulkner, has described a new set of dual-career guides as a “stepping stone” to help young players who more often than not face the question of what they will do when they retire from the game “too late”. Designed to inform young players about the academic and vocational options open to them while they play and develop, the guides have been produced in conjunction with the Talented Athlete Scholarship Scheme – a Sport England-funded partnership between talented athletes, education institutions and national governing bodies of sport.   Related: Lewes FC's Claire Rafferty: 'I hope one day every day is International Women’s Day'   “Players might only be thinking about today but we’ve got to help them keep an eye on tomorrow, that’s the key element,” said Faulkner. “I’m really pleased with how the academies have embraced further education as well as higher education and that it’s on their agenda. It would be eye-watering if you did the salary comparison [between the women’s and men’s games] today. “For me, this is a duty of care for us, as the FA. We’re not introducing a system that everyone has to follow, what we’re trying to do is give good practice and guidance and to make sure that mental health and wellbeing is constantly looked after. We’ve got around 25 players in the 12 WSL teams. Doing my maths, that’s 350 players and we’ve got thousands in the pathway coming through. They’re all not going to make it. That’s why this is important, in the first element, that there’s protection, that they make sure they get their priorities right. And secondly, if they do make it, that we make sure that they’ve got the option of continuous personal development so they’ve got something to step into on retirement.” There are plenty of examples of players who have built for a future away from the pitch. Arsenal defender Leah Williamson has studied accountancy, Chelsea forward Erin Cuthbert has started a master’s degree, and her teammate Beth England is studying law.  “The academic profile of girls in football is A*-B and you don’t want to dilute that,” said Faulkner. “However there are different ways to do it and certainly from what I learned in my education experience is rather than dilute straight down from three A-levels to BTec, we replaced one of the A-levels with a BTec to take the pressure slightly off, because if you’ve got high-performing individuals you’ve got to support that in the best way possible.   Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors’ picks.  “By doing that you don’t impact on their Ucas points, if they were still considering playing and studying in America it wouldn’t impact on Sats and it’s our job through the academy system to influence that.” The FA has also announced that, on the 27-28 March, during the next international break for the men’s Premier League and men’s Championship, every Women’s Super League and women’s Championship match will be screened live across the FA Player, the BBC, BT Sport and on the BBC Red Button.\\n\",\n",

       "  'title': 'Homeless and rough sleepers in England prioritised for vaccine',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'The government has taken up official advice that homeless people and those sleeping rough should be prioritised for coronavirus vaccines, given they are more likely to have undiagnosed conditions and have less regular access to healthcare. In a letter to the government’s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, (JCVI), which has set out the timetable for the vaccination programme, Matt Hancock agreed that homeless people should be put in group six, designated as people with underlying health conditions that place them at greater risk of Covid.   Related: How Manchester is reaching the homeless with Covid vaccinations   The health secretary also agreed to a JCVI suggestion that prison officers could be vaccinated early if there were any doses left over in jails or other detention settings that were intended for use by prisoners eligible under health or age criteria. The UK recorded 6,753 new coronavirus cases on Thursday, the highest daily figure for almost two weeks, although there has also been a significant rise in testing, as schools have fully returned in England. Other data showed that in the week to 7 March, 7% of local authorities in England recorded a rise in case rates, with 92% seeing a fall and one area unchanged. The JCVI and the government had opted not to offer early vaccinations to prison officers, or to other frontline staff such as police and teachers, and to base the rollout purely on age and health conditions, prompting objections from trade unions. In a letter to Hancock this month, the JCVI noted that people who were homeless or sleeping rough had high rates of undiagnosed comorbidities, and that half of them in effect had no access to healthcare.     Many thousands of usual rough sleepers are currently in accommodation, giving “a unique opportunity to in-reach vaccination to a population that is otherwise often unable to access basic healthcare”, the letter said. In his reply on Thursday, Hancock said he was happy for NHS England teams to treat homeless or rough-sleeping people alongside group 6, as part of a “pragmatic approach to the dosing schedule”. Prof Wei Shen Lim, the chair of the JCVI’s Covid-19 programme, said: “This advice will help us to protect more people who are at greater risk, ensuring that fewer people become seriously ill or die from the virus.” Hancock said on Thursday: “We know there are heightened risks for those who sleep rough and today I have accepted the advice of the independent experts at the JCVI to prioritise those experiencing rough sleeping or homelessness for vaccination alongside priority group 6.”     On prison officers, Hancock said in his letter that the vaccination programme was now reaching significant numbers of people in detention, but that NHS England should “bear the JCVI advice in mind for the future, considering its practicality, should current circumstances change”. But in principle, Hancock said, he was happy for prison staff to be given any unused doses, and “this should be done wherever possible”.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'Daphne Caruana Galizia: killer lays out murder plot in court',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'The self-confessed killer of Daphne Caruana Galizia told a court on Thursday that he and two other men used binoculars and a telescope to follow the movements of the investigative journalist for days, before planting and triggering the car bomb that killed her in 2017. Speaking in the presence of journalists and Caruana Galizia’s relatives in hall 22 of the law courts in Malta’s capital, Valletta, Vincent Muscat gave the fullest account yet of the plot to murder the journalist. Caruana Galizia’s death in October 2017 was met with outrage across Europe, and embroiled Malta’s ruling Labour party in a political scandal that led to the resignation of the prime minister in 2019. Seven men have either admitted to or been charged with complicity in the killing. They include the property and energy tycoon Yorgen Fenech, who has pleaded not guilty to masterminding the murder, and Melvin Theuma, a taxi-driver who confessed to being the middleman in the alleged contract killing. Muscat, who like Theuma has turned state witness, said he met two other men accused of direct involvement in the murder, the brothers George and Alfred Degiorgio, before Malta’s June 2017 general election. “Alfred Degiorgio came to me and told me there was a good job for me,” he told the court on Thursday, in remarks reported by Malta Today, which was following the hearing from the courtroom. He said the job was to kill Caruana Galizia and that a price of €150,000 had been agreed. “The plan was to follow her steps and shoot her when the time was right. After the election, Theuma gave us the go-ahead. He gave us a €30,000 advance in a brown leather bag. The sum was paid in €50 notes. We took €10,000 each and started work. Alfred and I followed her to Bidnija,” the village where Caruana Galizia lived. He said the three of them used binoculars and a telescope to observe Caruana Galizia’s movements closely, and they spent whole days watching her.  “We’d be sitting there on two bricks,” he said. “It was uncomfortable and you’d get sore … I was buying three packs of Rothmans Red [cigarettes] a day. We disposed of the butts in a water bottle, so as not to leave any trace. We watched Daphne on her sofa with a laptop until 2am.” Muscat said the original plan was to shoot Caruana Galizia in her home: “The plan was to have Alfred shoot from under the tree. I would take him away from the scene in a stolen car … George started coming up with excuses [such as] the rifle was too noisy.” The shooting plan was eventually abandoned and the men opted to use a bomb instead. “George Degiorgio always wanted a bomb … a bomb you place it at night and you leave. Quieter, less panic.” He said the men began to discuss obtaining a bomb from Jamie Vella, who pleaded not guilty last month to complicity in the killing.  Muscat said the bomb had a stainless steel face and an apparatus in which the sim card would be inserted. “You send a particular message to the sim card on the bomb,” he said. “It would explode seconds later.” In one particularly shocking moment in court, Muscat said he had told his alleged accomplices that he was worried that a car bomb might end up killing other people, and that they replied “we’ll go ahead, even if others are with her in the car”. While keeping watch over Caruana Galizia’s house, they noticed on the night of 15 October 2017 that, unusually, she had parked her car outside the gate of her home.  Muscat said he picked up the bomb, which was hidden in a shoebox, and met up with the other hitmen. They then placed the device beneath the driver’s seat. At 5am the next morning, Muscat and Alfred Degiorgio returned to a vantage point overlooking the house. In the early afternoon they saw Caruana Galizia drive off and informed George Degiorgio, who was in a boat, ready to trigger the bomb remotely. He detonated the bomb before his brother had given him the go-ahead. Caruana Galizia’s car was out of sight and Muscat said they did not hear the explosion, but they looked back and saw a plume of smoke. Muscat also reiterated claims he has previously made to police that he drove Alfred Degiorgio to meet the former economy minister Chris Cardona in Valletta in the run-up to the murder, and that Cardona allegedly tipped off the men before they were arrested in December 2017. Cardona told the Malta Independent that Muscat’s claims were “craziness and blatant lies”. “I was never aware of any project to kill anyone,” Cardona said. “This is pure evil fiction.” Before the hearing, Muscat apologised to the family of Caruana Galizia – a columnist and investigator whose blog on political corruption earned her a reputation as a “one-woman WikiLeaks”.  Theuma was granted a pardon in November 2019 to reveal what he knew about the murder and is living in a safe house. His evidence implicated Fenech, who was arrested in 2019 as he was attempting to leave Malta on his yacht. Fenech is in custody awaiting a decision on whether he will face trial. The then prime minister Joseph Muscat – no relation to Vincent Muscat – was forced to resign in 2019 after allegations that members of his administration had tried to sabotage the police investigation.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'Morrisons profits fall by half in 2020 as costs of Covid pandemic bite',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Morrisons’ profits for 2020 have slumped by half, which the supermarket’s chief executive called a badge of honour as the extra costs incurred in “feeding the nation” during the coronavirus crisis cancelled out the benefits of higher sales. The Bradford-based company’s annual pre-tax profit before one-offs fell to £201m on sales of £17.5bn.  David Potts, Morrisons’ chief executive, pointed to £290m of costs stemming from the pandemic, including covering for worker absence and paying store staff a bonus, coupled with the decision to return £230m of business rates relief. “I personally wear the halving of profits as a badge of honour,” he said. “It’s one thing being asked to keep indoors for most of the year, it is quite another if you haven’t got access to food. “Of course the British people have had access to food because supermarket workers were asked by government to be key workers and [stores] required to stay open unlike pretty much the rest of society. So frankly we could have made no profit and it would have been a result.” Sales at established stores were up by nearly 9% in the year to the end of January. Online sales tripled during the year, and capacity was up fivefold. The company’s online and wholesale businesses, which benefit from a partnership with Amazon, were in the black, and Potts expects them to become more profitable. Members of the Amazon Prime subscription service can buy Morrisons groceries through Amazon’s website for same-day delivery, with orders picked from the shelves of its nearby supermarkets. The service has reached 50 towns and cities, with the orders often making up more than 10% of a participating store’s sales, it said. Morrisons, which is viewed as a potential acquisition target for Amazon, is supplying the Amazon Fresh grocery store, which opened in London last week. Despite winning customer loyalty with its efforts during the pandemic, including food bank donations and food box deliveries, the company is unloved by the City. The decline in its share price led to it being booted out of the FTSE 100 last week. Its shares were trading down marginally on Thursday after the full-year results announcement and are worth roughly the same as a year ago.   Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk   Potts said shareholders had been rewarded with higher dividends and pointed to a recovery in profits as the economy reopens. The closure of its 407 cafes and decline in fuel and food-to-go sales alone wiped out £100m of profit. The supermarket told analysts that this year’s profits would be higher than the £431m it would have banked had it not waived rates relief. The forecast is based on a return to more normal trading conditions and the extra Covid-19 costs falling away. Freetrade’s senior analyst, Dan Lane, said investors had got ahead of themselves when they anticipated supermarkets would profit from last year’s panic-buying. “The cost of servicing the loo-roll hoarders has been eye-watering,” he said. “Covid-related impairments have really weighed Morrisons down but that’s hopefully a one-off. Looking ahead, there’s a lot for investors to mull over, not least the closer tie-ups with Amazon.”\\n',\n",

       "  'full_article': 'Two Canadian men detained in China are likely to stand trial in the coming weeks, according to a state-backed newspaper, dimming hopes that a diplomatic deal could secure their release. Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor have been held without bail for more than 820 days, since they were detained soon after the Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou was arrested on a US warrant in Vancouver. On Thursday, an editorial in the state-run Global Times said they would face trial “soon”, citing anonymous sources. “Kovrig was accused of having used an ordinary passport and business visa to enter China to steal sensitive information and intelligence through contacts in China since 2017, while Spavor was accused of being a key source of intelligence for Kovrig,” the paper wrote. “They are suspected of crimes endangering China’s national security, and have already been prosecuted.” In some cases, a guilty verdict in espionage cases can mean life in prison. China’s courts have a notorious reputation for high rates of conviction. Canada’s foreign ministry says it is “not aware” of any timeline for the trial of the two men. “The Canadian government remains deeply concerned by the arbitrary detention by Chinese authorities of Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig since December 2018 and continues to call for their immediate release,” a spokesperson for Global Affairs Canada told the Guardian by email, adding that consular officials continue to provide services for the two men. Despite claims from China that the two were endangering national security, Canada maintains Beijing is conducting hostage diplomacy. Justin Trudeau, the prime minister, has previously said he believes the arrests were carried out in retaliation for Meng’s detention. The Huawei executive is currently fighting extradition to the US on fraud charges. Her court hearing is expected to conclude on 14 May. For two years, Canada has worked to build global support for its campaign to secure the release of the two. Last month, it signed a declaration against arbitrary detention, prompting anger from China. As its options run low the Canadian government has increasingly pinned its hopes that pressure from the US could help secure the release of the men. “Human beings are not bartering chips,” Joe Biden, the US president, told reporters last month. “We’re going to work together until we get their safe return. Canada and the United States will stand together against abuse of universal rights and democratic freedom.”\\n',\n",

       "  'full_article': \"MEPs have voted to declare the EU an “LGBTIQ freedom zone” in a symbolic protest against discriminatory policies promoted in Poland and Hungary where regions have set themselves against the “ideology” of equality. Two years after the first local authority in Poland declared itself an ‘‘LGBTIQ-free zone”, the European parliament adopted its resolution by 492 votes in favour, 141 against and 46 abstentions. Among those who opposed the resolution were eleven members of the European people’s party, the centre-right grouping the parliament in which Angela Merkel’s CDU sits. MEPs said in their resolution that people “in the EU should enjoy the freedom to live and publicly show their sexual orientation and gender identity without fear of intolerance, discrimination or persecution”. “Authorities at all levels of governance across the EU should protect and promote equality and the fundamental rights of all, including LGBTIQ persons,” the resolution added. More than 100 Polish regions, counties and municipalities have adopted resolutions since March 2019 declaring themselves to be free from LGBTIQ ideas. Local governments have pledged to refrain from encouraging tolerance towards LGBTIQ people and to cut financial assistance to organisations promoting non-discrimination and equality. The MEPs’ resolution also noted the deteriorating situation in Hungary. In November 2020, the town of Nagykáta adopted a resolution banning the “dissemination and promotion of LGBTIQ propaganda”.Addressing the parliament ahead of the vote, Terry Reintke, a German MEP in the Greens group, said the chamber’s resolution was a “first step”. She said: “You call us lunatics. You call us an irrelevant minority. You call us perverts. You call us an ideology. When all we ask for is equality.   Related: How globalisation has transformed the fight for LGBTQ+ rights – podcast   “You paraphrase books written thousands of years ago to justify your hate. You take away our rights to distract from the shortcomings of your own politics. “You scapegoat our communities when all we ask for is safety. You attack our families. You tell people we are a threat. You deny us the right to be who we want to be when all we ask is freedom. But we will not give up just because you keep attacking us.” “This declaration might only be a first step,” Reintke said. “We know our lives are still in danger, our rights restricted, our freedoms brutally suffocated in far too many places in the European union. But it is a step. We are many, we are everywhere and we are strong.” The European commission has recently rejected applications for funding under its twinning programme from Polish towns that have adopted so called “LGBT free zone” resolutions. As part of Thursday’s resolution, MEPs called on the EU’s executive branch to go further by launching infringement proceedings through the European court of justice and cutting funding to central governments. The vote came as Clément Beaune, France’s European affairs minister, who came out in December, revealed that Poland’s right-wing government had threatened to cancel his meetings during a recent trip to the country if he visited a village that had declared itself an “LGBT-ideology free zone”.   Related: Ursula von der Leyen says Poland's 'LGBT-free zones' have no place in EU   During a two-day trip to Poland this week, Beaune, a close ally of the French president Emmanuel Macron, had planned to stop in the village of Krasnik to highlight its discriminatory policies. “They didn’t want me to go there. They didn’t physically prevent me, it was political pressure,” Beaune told France Inter radio. The minister said he was informed that “if I went there, there wouldn’t be any official meetings during the trip”. Beaune vowed to return to the country and travel to one of the anti-gay zones. “I think it’s serious, but I don’t want to cause a controversy with a government,” Beaune said. “What is very serious is the situation on the ground, not my personal case.” \\n\",\n",

       "  'full_article': 'A Twenty20 series that promises to be more competitive than the Tests begins in Ahmedabad on Friday with the two captains in disagreement. Eoin Morgan says India are favourites to win the World Cup they host later this year, while Virat Kohli believes this tag belongs to England. These conflicting views were essentially just a bit of pre-match pantomime but five games in the giant Narendra Modi stadium – tipped to welcome bumper crowds – will certainly go a long way to helping both sides shape plans, personnel, match-ups and tactics before the main event in October.   Related: England must learn lessons from India tour but future still looks bright | Ebony Rainford-Brent   This is not to say there is not expectation. India deal with it every time they step on to the field, while England are under a wee bit of pressure to put on a show – for the sake of the selectors if no one else – given the rotation system, much chuntered about after the 3-1 Test defeat, was devised with this series at its apex. While they have risen to No 1 in the rankings, it is not often Morgan has all the multi-format stars at his disposal. This was the case before Christmas when they brushed South Africa aside 3-0, however, and it would be a surprise if England veered away from the top six then which had Jason Roy and Jos Buttler open, before Dawid Malan, Jonny Bairstow, Ben Stokes and the captain following behind. There are subplots here. Roy is in need of runs after a lean time since his flashing blade ignited England’s 50-over World Cup campaign in 2019 and is likely to be challenged by spin early, while Malan, already the subject of a “how can India stop him?” headline in the local press after rising to the top of the format’s batting rankings, plays his first international cricket on the subcontinent. But chiefly England’s selection decisions appear to be between two all-rounders in Moeen Ali and Sam Curran at No 7 and, unless both play, the fourth bowler alongside Adil Rashid, Chris Jordan and Jofra Archer. England sometimes struggle with economy and wickets in the powerplay, something Morgan says has been masked by the batting unit’s ability to either build or chase big totals. Tom Curran, Mark Wood and Reece Topley are the options in India and the good news is that Archer is fit after an elbow injury curtailed his Test series. He is also seemingly smarting from a suggestion that he is not motivated by all three formats but Morgan has no problems from a white-ball perspective (bar perhaps the fact his 90mph spearhead is limited to only four overs in Twenty20 cricket). “Jofra is a huge asset,” said Morgan. “He is a guy who can bowl in three parts of the game and be threatening when he comes on. He obviously has express pace, can bowl cutters, variations and has a very good yorker.” Morgan similarly waxed lyrical about Moeen, describing the all-rounder’s experience as “worth its weight in gold”, and his spin bowling could be important if the England captain gets pitches he hopes will further the education of his batsmen. Rashid, a rare England player without an Indian Premier League deal and hoping to gain more experience of the conditions, will hope this is the case also. India, meanwhile, are aiming to forge their Twenty20 identity, despite a recent series victory in Australia and sitting second in the rankings. Kohli, just shy of 3,000 runs in the format, wants more power in the batting and not least since Jasprit Bumrah, peerless when it comes to defence with the ball, is absent because of a clash with his wedding. Kohli said: “We want to be a side that plays free cricket, and not have any baggage from lack of depth with one guy having to bat long enough to make sure we get to a big total. We have explosive batsmen in the team now, who can change the game at any stage, even if we’re two or three wickets down.” After a formidable top three of KL Rahul, Rohit Sharma and Kohli, potential for fireworks lower down comes from Rishabh Pant and Hardik Pandya. The former had a quiet IPL last year but was superb during the recent Tests, while the latter is being spoken about as a rival to Kieron Pollard of West Indies as a gamechanging hitter.   The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.  Thereafter it is down to which combination of bowlers can best make up for the loss of Bumrah. Five games on the same square should bring spinners into the equation and though Ravichandran Ashwin is not a feature of this squad – summing up India’s depth – Axar Patel is an option if Kohli wants to prey on scars from the Test series. All told, both sides are impressive but with areas still to fully nail down before the World Cup comes into view. Over the course of the next nine days we may move closer to deciding which captain to agree with as regards the title of favourites.

The duo did not dominate immediately, of course, for back in 2005 Luis García was the undisputed king. But their rises had certainly begun and they have reigned supreme since then, give or take the odd 8-2 Müllering, and a few international no-shows by one of Argentina’s finest.

Then, a team of elite English sticklers in Paris used similar equipment to award PSG a penalty that no one reasonably asked for after Clément Lenglet didn’t jump out of the way of Mauro Icardi, in an incident that might as well have happened at Sydney Opera House given how much it actually affected events at the Parc des Princes. Mbappé converted the penalty, and then the same officials failed to spot Marco Verratti encroaching when Messi goofed from the spot a few minutes later. Farewell, Messi and Ronaldo?

       "  'title': \"SNP focus on Scottish independence is 'wrong debate', says Starmer \",\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Keir Starmer has criticised the SNP for focusing on the “wrong debate” by demanding Scottish independence, but conceded the UK must “change to survive”, as Labour gears up for the May elections. The Labour leader was launching his campaign for what the party expects to be a tough set of elections to the Scottish and Welsh parliaments and English councils. Labour has often previously run completely separate campaigns in Scotland, but Starmer is keen to stress that Labour is focused on the NHS, jobs and growth throughout the UK. The new Scottish Labour leader, Anas Sarwar, appeared at the online launch event, as did the Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford. Asked about recent comments from Drakeford that the UK “is over”, Starmer agreed that it was time for constitutional change. “I believe in the United Kingdom, and what Mark Drakeford was saying was that he believes in the United Kingdom, but he recognises it’s got to change to survive. And he’s right about that,” he said. “If the debate anywhere, particularly Scotland, is simply between the status quo and independence, then it’s the wrong debate. I absolutely want to make a passionate case for the United Kingdom, and a socially just Scotland in a modern United Kingdom. And that’s the message we’ll be carrying to the voters in Scotland this May.” Starmer recently asked the former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown to chair a constitutional commission, which will examine the status of Scotland and Wales as well as the case for more English devolution. Brown has previously promoted federalism – with sweeping new powers for Holyrood – as the best response to the pressure for independence and the uncertainty unleashed by Brexit. In his speech at the launch event, Sarwar said: “I don’t think it’s credible for us to come through this collective trauma and go back to the old arguments. Arguing with each other while our NHS loses out on funding. Arguing with each other while our businesses close down and children miss out on vital education. “And therefore I want people to know that the Scottish Labour party is on their side. It’s on their side on the issues that matter to them.” In the 2016 Holyrood elections, Labour under Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership was pushed into third place by the Conservatives. It hopes to regain some of that ground in May. The party has been buoyed up by several recent polls suggesting that support for independence is slipping modestly, and the public falling-out between Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon may have dented SNP support. A YouGov poll for the Times on Thursday suggested 36% of voters think there should be a referendum on Scottish independence this year if the SNP wins a majority at Holyrood – down from 43% last November. Support for independence itself slipped to 49%, from 51% in November. A separate poll for the Scotsman newspaper this week suggested the SNP could miss out on a majority in May’s elections, which were delayed from last year because of the pandemic. In Westminster, Boris Johnson’s government is devoting an increasing amount of political energy to trying to undermine the case for Scottish independence, including by highlighting the success of the vaccine programme as a cross-UK endeavour. The prime minister reportedly told a recent meeting of backbench Tory MPs that without the union, “the SNP government in Scotland would not have a single vaccine for the Scottish people”. As well as the Scottish and Welsh parliaments, there will be elections to many local councils in England on 6 May, as well as a string of mayoralties, including in the West Midlands, Manchester and Teesside. Labour is playing down hopes of making gains, but many in the party will see the results as a test of Starmer’s progress in rebuilding support after the 2019 general election defeat. The Electoral Commission has published new guidance on Thursday about how the elections can be conducted. Candidates will be allowed to knock on doors or deliver campaign leaflets, as long as they give their party’s pitch from 2 metres away and do not go inside. They will also be able to offer masks and hand sanitiser to people as a way to encourage them to turn out to vote – but only if this is “to assist voters generally”, and not to encourage them to vote a certain way, an offence known as “treating”. If masks or bottles of sanitiser carry a party logo or slogan, they must then also then have the small print that is seen on election leaflets, stating who has paid for it. Also, someone wearing a party logo mask may be asked to change it if they wear it to a polling station, as campaign items are not allowed there. Finally, if parties do decide they want to hand out masks or sanitiser, this counts as election spending and must be included on their spending return.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'UK forced to delay checks on imports from EU by six months',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'The UK government has been forced to delay the introduction of import checks by six months, in a U-turn in post-Brexit policy, because a network of 30 border posts being built to process incoming goods would not have been ready on time. Exports to the EU from Britain have been subject to controls since 1 January, but the government decided to opt for a phased approach on EU imports to give hauliers and business more time to adapt. Checks were due to be introduced in stages from 1 April and from 1 July, but in recent days traders and ports have said they are not ready and that the introduction of processes as originally planned could lead to empty supermarket shelves. Michael Gove, the minister for the Cabinet Office, told the House of Commons on Thursday that the government had responded to businesses’ requests for more time and announced what he called a “revised timetable”. Gove blamed the need for delays on the pandemic, telling MPs the previous timetable was “based on the impacts of the first wave of Covid” but that the government had reviewed deadlines because the disruption had been wider and longer-lasting than expected. Most import checks have now been pushed back to 1 January 2022, meaning Britain will begin these processes a year later than the EU. Andrew Opie, the director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, a lobby group, said the postponement had come “in the nick of time”. He said it would “ultimately reduce the impact on consumers from 1 April who might otherwise have seen empty shelves for some products”. Opie added: “Until the infrastructure is in place, with IT systems ready and established processes for checks and paperwork, it would be foolhardy to introduce full requirements for export health certificate documentation, pre-notification of imports, physical checks and more.” British customs were due to begin controlling imports of animal products, live animals and plants and products from 1 April, including food considered high-risk such as mince and sausages. The checks, known as sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) controls, require consignments to have the correct documentation and import and health certificates signed by vets on arrival in Britain. These SPS checks along with customs inspections were expected to take place from 1 July at new designated border control posts (BCPs) on goods entering by sea, road or air. However, in recent weeks a string of British ports had said the facilities would not be ready in time for the July deadline, partly as a result of complications with the government’s funding of the new infrastructure. This week the British Ports Association, an industry body, wrote to the government to urge it to extend the deadline. In addition, several of the inland facilities being built by the government at locations where there is not enough space available for a border control post directly next to the port are running behind schedule. The White Cliffs inland site in Kent, where goods arriving at Dover will be checked, is described as still being a “muddy field”. In addition, the locations of the two inland sites in Wales that are being developed by the Welsh and UK governments have not yet been announced. Physical SPS checks on animal products, as well as foods and plants considered high risk will not take place until 1 January. From this date these checks will take place at designated border control posts rather than at their destination, as is currently the case. Checks on live animals and low-risk plants will only take place from March 2022 at BCPs. In addition, traders will be able to continue submitting deferred customs declarations, whereby paperwork can be provided up to six months after goods have been imported, until the start of 2022.   Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk   There have also been severe teething problems in the implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol and new trading rules with the EU. The EU is preparing to launch legal action within days after the government last week announced it was unilaterally extending a series of “grace periods” to allow businesses in Northern Ireland more time to adapt to post-Brexit rules. Speaking to journalists on Thursday, the EU’s ambassador to the UK, João Vale de Almeida, said both sides should “give up on trying to score points” and work to rebuild trust. It is understood Vale de Almeida has not yet met David Frost, the cabinet minister in charge of UK relations with the EU and the former trade negotiator. EU sources are understood to feel alarm at rumours circulating that the UK government has motive to make the Northern Ireland protocol inoperable in order to force a renegotiation – a situation tha Brussels would face down in the strongest possible terms.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': \"Ligeti: The 18 Études review | Andrew Clements's classical album of the week\",\n",
       "  'full_article': 'The studies that György Ligeti composed in the last two decades of his life are the most important additions to the solo-piano repertoire in the last half-century. On their own terms, the 18 pieces the composer completed, before ill-health forced him to stop composing four years before his death in 2006, continue the great tradition of transcendental piano writing that stretches back to Chopin and Liszt, always testing their performers’ techniques to the limit and sometimes beyond.    Ligeti: The 18 Études by Danny Driver album cover Photograph: Publicity image   Yet stylistically Ligeti’s piano writing owes very little, if anything, to the composers who defined that tradition. The influences shaping these pieces are those that permeate all of his later work, after it changed direction so decisively in the early 1980s – from the polyrhythmic player-piano studies of Conlon Nancarrow to the music of sub-Saharan Africa, chaos theory to the minimalism of Steve Reich. In the Études, Ligeti effectively created a new pianistic vocabulary, while remaining exuberantly himself – the moments when the music seems to evaporate in the highest reaches of the keyboard, or flounders in its lowest depths, find orchestral equivalents throughout his music of more than 40 years. Danny Driver has been including groups of the pieces in his recital programmes for some years now. It’s clearly music that he admires hugely and understands profoundly, and, as he writes in his sleeve notes, the challenge is “putting the emotional and evocative power of these pieces centre stage despite their intransigent virtuosity”. He manages to do that better than any of the other complete surveys of these pieces I’ve heard; only Pierre-Laurent Aimard’s magisterial recordings, split across two totally separate discs, match and sometimes surpass his insights. But Driver’s performances certainly leave no doubt of the music’s dazzling originality and enduring importance. This week’s other pick Four years ago, Mark Viner began his survey of Charles-Valentin Alkan’s piano music for Piano Classics with an outstanding account of the fiendishly demanding Études in All the Major Keys, Op 35, the epitome of keyboard transcendentalism. The main work on his latest disc (the fourth in a projected series of 17) is another of Alkan’s greatest achievements, the Symphonie that forms four movements of his Op 39, the 12 Études in All the Minor Keys, a set that also includes the Concerto for solo piano and a final huge set of variations, Le Festin d’Ésope.    The Symphony is music of immense technical complexity – ferocious double octaves, massive chordal explosions, vertiginous scales – with occasional moments of quiet lyricism, and Viner negotiates it all with wonderful aplomb and just the right amount of swagger. He doesn’t spare himself on the rest of the disc either, in a sequence of marches and two programmatic paraphrases, all dazzlingly played.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': \"Kimmel on Biden's Covid relief bill: 'Naturally, Republicans are against it'\",\n",
       "  'full_article': \"Jimmy Kimmel The US House passed a sweeping $1.9tn Covid relief bill on Wednesday, a massive emergency relief measure that marks the first major legislative victory of Joe Biden’s presidency. The bill, passed along party lines in the House and Senate, will provide critical financial relief to millions of Americans through $1,400 stimulus checks, extend unemployment benefits in the middle of a pandemic-induced recession, and expand access to healthcare. “So naturally, Republicans are against it,” Jimmy Kimmel joked on Wednesday night.    No Republicans voted for the bill in either the House or the Senate, “even though more than 70% of Americans support it”, Kimmel continued. “The only other bill 70% of Americans support is Murray. It’s very rare to have that.” Kimmel saw a clear reason for the stark partisan divide: “Republicans in Congress can’t support it because Democrats in Congress do support it.   Related: Colbert on Piers Morgan: 'Tomorrow is going to be a great morning Britain'   “If a meteor was hurtling toward the Earth and Chuck Schumer said, ‘We’ve got to stop this,’” he added, “Mitch McConnell would be like, ‘No, we don’t. Could lead to socialism.’” Stephen Colbert    According to the Biden administration, a large number of Americans could receive their $1,400 stimulus payments before the end of March. “Do you know what that means? There’s finally going to be an end of March,” joked Stephen Colbert on the Late Show. The relief bill is a popular legislative victory – according to polls, 75% of voters say they support the package, and Biden’s approval rating since he took office has remained steady at 57%. “Old steady Joe, he may not be as exciting as the last guy we were with, but you know, he’s good with kids, in that he cares whether they live in poverty,” Colbert said. It’s also helpful that Biden isn’t proving to be an easy target for the GOP base. “Turns out spending a year calling someone senile and sleepy doesn’t make him a good boogeyman,” Colbert explained, citing one GOP spokesperson who claimed, “there’s just not the antipathy to Biden like there was Obama. He just doesn’t drive conservative outrage.” “Hmm, I wonder what was different about Obama that enraged their base?” Colbert deadpanned. “Maybe the royal family knows.” Samantha Bee On Full Frontal, Samantha Bee investigated the role white women are playing in the perpetuation and legitimization of the QAnon conspiracy movement, the “bullshit rightwing conspiracy theory accusing Democrats and celebrities such as Tom Hanks of worshipping Satan, drinking blood and trafficking children”. “I have to emphasize that these claims are completely baseless,” Bee added. “Tom Hanks would never do anything to harm a child! Except for making the Polar Express.”    In the last year, white women have been joining QAnon in droves, becoming the primary drivers of the conspiracy movement. So-called “Q-A-moms”, often members of natural or holistic birth communities, have been targeted by posts about child sex trafficking conspiracies that appeal to their protective maternal instincts. These posts often don’t mention Q specifically but hint at larger conspiracies of sex trafficking cover-ups in the familiar soothing, Instagram-friendly aesthetic common to wellness ads. “Pastel QAnon”, as Bee called this recruitment method, is “at least better than the first name they gave it, which is ‘crazy bitch shit’”, she joked. During the pandemic, “many women took to the internet to ask questions about how to keep their family safe, and landed in a pit of pseudo-scientific research that suggested masks made coronavirus worse, and that social distancing weakened the immune system”, Bee explained. “Before long, those conspiracies evolved into wilder rumors about the deep state and child trafficking. “These kinds of theories may sound ridiculous, but as we saw during the Capitol insurrection, they have very real consequences,” she added, noting that QAnon devotee Ashli Babbitt was shot and killed by Capitol police during the riot. “And QAnon’s online mommy rebrand has only caused more damage.” Seth Meyers    And on Late Night, Seth Meyers blasted the faux cancel culture wars fomented by Fox News in the face of Biden’s popular Covid relief bill. As Congress passed a bill to provide critical aid to Americans during a pandemic, Fox News hosts such as Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity lamented the removal of Pepe Le Pew from an upcoming Space Jam sequel. “Personally, I can’t believe Fox News is defending someone who’s French,” Meyers joked. “If this was 2003, they’d be referring to him as a ‘freedom skunk’.” For viewers too young to recall the reference, Meyers explained that it was a distant time when “conservatives canceled french fries”. “Seriously, imagine being an actual adult and spending any amount of time at all complaining about a decades-old cartoon character being left out of a movie,” Meyers added. “The point is, guys, there’s a pandemic raging, millions suffering or out of work, and you’re spending your time defending the Looney Tunes, the whole thing is just, well, I want to say looney tunes, but that seems redundant.”\\n\",\n",

       "  'title': ' John Lewis to close more stores as Covid crisis wipes out profits',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'John Lewis Partnership does not expect to reopen some of its department stores when lockdown ends, after slumping to a £517m loss for 2020. The staff-owned retailer, which runs 42 department stores and the Waitrose supermarket chain, confirmed it would not be paying a bonus to staff for the first time in 67 years, as chairman, Sharon White, said it was “not out of the crisis” caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. John Lewis said it was unlikely to pay a bonus again next year either when it forecast the financial results would be even worse, owing to investment in a five-year turnaround plan. In the year ahead, the group plans to plough £800m into improving stores and upgrading online shopping infrastructure including developing its shopping app for smartphones. “It’s been a real economic earthquake. We’ve seen decades worth of change in the space of one year,” White said. “Shopping habits have changed irreversibly.” She said customers were not only moving online, but wanted more convenient local outlets as they expected to work more from home. The mutual’s first-ever full-year loss comes after £648m of one-off costs relating to the writedown in value of the John Lewis estate amid the shift to online shopping, as well as restructuring and redundancy costs from store closures and head office reorganisation. White said the group would be holding on to government business rates relief and furlough support worth £190m, which had “helped to keep us running and avoid more severe restructuring”. The group intends to continue claiming business rates relief until June. She confirmed some John Lewis department stores were not expected to reopen when lockdown measures were lifted in April. Instead there are plans for dozens of John Lewis-branded areas in Waitrose stores around the country and “smaller, more flexible” outlets in local neighbourhoods. A final decision on the store closures is expected by the end of March after discussions with landlords complete. The group has set aside £75m to cover restructuring in the year ahead, which is likely to include job losses at closing stores and other operational changes. White said: “Hard as it is, there is no getting away from the fact that some areas can no longer profitably sustain a John Lewis store. We are not out of the crisis yet and the economic environment remains extremely uncertain.” Some industry watchers have suggested the changes could leave John Lewis no different to the likes of Argos – where it is possible to order goods online and pick them up in a store. Pippa Wicks, the boss of the John Lewis department stores, said staff would continue to use specialist knowledge to offer extra services both on the high street and online where the group now offers virtual personal styling or home advice sessions. “We are absolutely not the Argos of the middle classes,” she said. White plans to introduce new lower-priced products when its department stores reopen in a bid to improve value for money under plans to ditch its “never knowingly undersold” pricing pledge which has been in place since 1925. Sales at the John Lewis chain slipped just 4% to just over £4bn and operating profits were down by about 25% as online sales soared 73%, almost offsetting 20 weeks of store closures in the year. Online now accounts for three-quarters of the department store’s trade, up from 42% before the pandemic. Sales were helped by a rush for technology to support home working and schooling. However, fashion and cosmetics sales dived as the need for workwear and outfits for social occasions slumped under lockdown restrictions.   Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk   At Waitrose, sales jumped 10% to £7.6bn and operating profits rose 8% to £1.1bn. The supermarket also experienced a big switch to online trading which now accounts for 20% of sales, up from 5% before the pandemic. White said she expected most of the online shift to be permanent but that the group’s stores would remain an important part of its business. “The high street is changing and our place on it is changing with it,” she said. Before the one-off writedowns, group profits rose to £131m in the year to 30 January from £70m a year before, underpinned by the business rates support. White said the outcome was better than her fears of a small loss as trading had been stronger than expected in the second half of the year, with consumers switching to online shopping during the national lockdowns. Nick Bubb, an independent retail analyst, expressed surprise that the John Lewis Partnership (JLP) had neither paid out a bonus to staff nor returned the Waitrose business rates relief, given what he described as a “decent” underlying performance. “With profits emerging so much better than expected, JLP should have changed its stance,” he said.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': \"The future of cookbooks? Here's what happened when I tested Ruby Tandoh's audio baking guide\",\n",
       "  'full_article': 'It must be difficult to deliver recipes in a pioneering way. This is because, in the cookbook, the form has already reached its apex. If you’ve never used a cookbook before, you’re really missing out. You open the book at the correct page, and then all the information just stays exactly where it is until you don’t need it any more. It’s brilliant, maybe even unimprovable. But trying telling that to Ruby Tandoh, who is about to release the future of cookbooks in Breaking Eggs. Imagine an audiobook that tells you how to bake things – that’s Breaking Eggs. And it claims to be the first of its kind. Intrigued by the prospect of a cookbook you can’t see, I recently spent a morning attempting to follow it. Breaking Eggs consists of just four recipes; a butter cake, an apple galette, some vanilla custard buns and some brownies, each narrated in real time by Tandoh. I was highly sceptical of this as a concept, so I picked the butter cake on the basis that it seemed quite easy, and would therefore be over quickest. I was sceptical because you should be allowed to cook things at your own pace. Some people like to scan the recipe once and plunge in, others like to read and re-read to make sure they’re going to get it right. And although the audio guide comes with a pdf listing the ingredients and equipment you’ll need, the thought of encountering each step for the first time, while you’re already in the middle of making the thing, seemed unnecessarily stressful. Remember those old Gordon Ramsay cookalong shows, where you ostensibly made a Christmas dinner in real time with him? Nobody actually did that. It was a stupid idea. Nevertheless, I assembled my ingredients and gave it my best shot. The baking No sooner has Tandoh talked you though the ingredients than she slows to a crawl, spending two minutes telling you how to put some butter and sugar into a bowl. Not how to mix it – that comes later – but just how to put them into a bowl. “While you get on with that, let me tell you a bit more about cake”, she says, before explaining the role of moisture in cake. Too little moisture will make the cake “stodgy and dry”, too much and “it’ll be gluey”. This sort of meditative riffing is a nice touch, but less appreciated when time is of the essence. For example, during this stage, my three-year-old wandered up and offered to help me bake, which largely involved him trying to smash an egg on the dining table while shouting “STOP TALKING” at the phone on which I was playing the recipe. This meant I had to take my buttery hands and wipe them all over the phone to pause the recording.     Ready, steady ... wait till you’re told what to do next. Photograph: Stuart Heritage   This is roughly when I realised that the problem was less to do with Tandoh’s guide and more to do with my circumstances. Baking used to be something that I did to relax; taking long, leisurely mornings to assemble something beautiful with as much care as possible. But now I’ve taken to hammering through recipes, cutting corners and missing details because the kids are crying and work keeps emailing and there’s laundry to be folded and a million other things.     Stuart Heritage and his son while attempting Breaking Eggs. Photograph: Stuart Heritage   This is how I entered into Breaking Eggs; stressed, distracted and on three separate deadlines. If it had been a book, I would have glanced at the instructions once and chucked together a rough approximation from memory as quickly as possible. But because it was an audio guide, and because Tandoh’s narration was so slow and measured, I had no option but to fall in behind her. When she tells you to line a tin with baking paper, and then spends the next two minutes discussing the various properties of cake as a concept, you’re pretty much banned from moving on. You’re much more likely to spend those two minutes concentrating on the lining. This quickly becomes the tempo. When you cream the butter and eggs, Tandoh does such a thorough job of explaining its importance that you’ll invariably take more care over it than usual. Same with adding eggs. I may not have wanted to at first, but Breaking Eggs slowed me down. It forced me to concentrate on every step. Even licking the bowl. “Raw flour and raw eggs can contain nasty germs, so I wouldn’t recommend you do this,” she says. “Or would I? Look, you’re your own boss”. The result The chapter ends with Tandoh telling us to put the cake in the oven, wash up and watch something nice on television. An hour later, I’m rewarded with a cake that is beautiful, dense and rich with vanilla. It was gone in about two hours. Whether that’s down to Tandoh’s recipe, or because the mode of delivery demands that the listener takes care, I don’t know. Maybe a bit of both.    Proof is in the eating ... Stuart’s cake. Photograph: Stuart Heritage   As it went into the oven, my three-year-old grabbed the spatula, jammed it into his mouth and ran away into the living room. He poked his head back in a couple of moments later and asked if we could bake something together again soon. Maybe this is the future after all. Breaking Eggs: An Audio Guide to Baking by Ruby Tandoh is available to order now from Audible.\\n',\n",

       "  'full_article': 'With their 1979 semi-autobiographical novel Puberty Blues, teenage writers Gabrielle Carey and Kathy Lette exposed the brutally sexist undercurrent of the Cronulla surfing community they grew up in. Both the book and Bruce Beresford’s 1981 film adaptation offered a sharp rebuttal to the idealised version of the Australian beach – that of an egalitarian paradise – that has long lived in our collective imagination. The beach is justifiably a beloved part of Australian life, but we also know that for many it can be exclusionary and unsafe. The brilliance of Puberty Blues, the 2012 television adaptation of Carey and Lette’s book that ran for two seasons, is that it embraces these conflicting truths about the beach and, by extension, our national identity.   Related: Love: offbeat romcom about addiction, dating and two basically terrible people   Explicit criticism of misogyny within the characters’ surfing community remains fundamental to the series. As our heroes Debbie and Sue discover, the surfing gang they long to join rules the beach, and their bodies. Girls in the Greenhills gang must eagerly provide the surfers with food, admiration and sexual pleasure, and be content to get none in return. Panel vans, ubiquitous throughout the series, operate as a portable microcosm of the beach: an Australian icon that is a site of freedom for boys and sexual oppression for girls. Seeing social outcast Frieda reluctantly participating in panel van group sex with the surfers was the most harrowing moment in the film, and it’s equally confronting here.    Girls in the Greenhills gang must eagerly provide the surfers with food, admiration and sexual pleasure, and be content to get none in return. Photograph: Channel 10   The series moves beyond the scope of the book and the film by examining sexism among adults in the broader community, from casual arse-grabbing in the workplace to the devastating double standards surrounding infidelity. We see how this systemic inequality seeps through generations. One of the series’ most nuanced arcs belongs to Cheryl, whose mean-girl exterior is exposed as defensive acting out in response to a troubled home life and relentless mistreatment by men. Gary, apparently the only surfer with a conscience, turns to hard drugs to escape from the dual expectations of his misogynistic father and amoral mates. Despite the series’ preoccupation with these bleak realities, there is also a lot of joy to be found, both in the storylines and in the lovingly rendered period detail. The heady nostalgia of crocheted bikinis, home phones and Polly Waffles is as appealing as the tender core friendship between Debbie and Sue, which triumphs above all else. The series is beautifully written, filmed and acted. It’s clear that the creators hold a deep reverence for the perceived simplicity of the era, and for the appeal of the coastal communities so many Australians have grown up in. Scenes such as Sue’s spirited parents drunkenly frolicking in the nighttime waves unapologetically celebrate the beach’s libertarian potential.    This is just the way it was, the series seems to say – and this transparency makes the darker elements more convincing. Photograph: Channel 10   The inclusion of so much positivity might elsewhere feel jarring or contradictory, but here it just feels honest. There is no explicit attempt to demonise the beach, or the 1970s, or Australia – this is just the way it was, the series seems to say – and this transparency makes the darker elements more convincing.   Related: Blue Heelers: rewatching the classic Australian small-town police procedural   There are also some clear ties to sinister chapters of Australian beach history, particularly in the second season, which reinforces the sense of accuracy. That the series takes place in Cronulla will be enough to bring the 2005 riots to many minds, but a shockingly casual act of violence against a Japanese character in the final episode offers a more explicit link to normalised racism.  By laying bare the messy complexities of one beach community, Puberty Blues asks us to accept the discomfort that comes with loving parts of Australian culture while acknowledging the harm they can bring. The request is neatly captured in its opening song, Dragon’s Are You Old Enough, a brilliant and beloved pop hit that many listeners also hear as an ode to sex with underage girls. There is no easy answer to be found: the beach is glorious and dangerous, loved and feared, liberating and oppressive. In telling us something so truthful about ourselves, the series proves itself just as revolutionary as its predecessors. • Puberty Blues is available to stream on 10Play.

       "  'title': \"Australia's proposed anti-corruption commission creates 'retrograde' system\",\n",
       "  'full_article': \"The federal government’s draft anti-corruption commission legislation lacks any credibility, and would create a weak, ineffective body that would actually degrade part of Australia’s existing integrity framework, Transparency International has warned. The government is currently consulting with key stakeholders on draft legislation for its proposed Commonwealth Integrity Commission, after years of delay and missed deadlines. Prior to releasing the draft legislation, the proposed model was already subject to scathing criticism, particularly for its lack of public hearings, the high threshold it requires to investigate matters, its inability to act directly on public tip-offs, and the favourable way it treats politicians and public servants compared to law enforcement officials.   Related: Toothless tiger? Five problems with the Coalition's anti-corruption commission   Transparency International Australia’s submission, which is yet to be published, says the draft legislation not only lacks credibility, it actually creates a “retrograde” system in critical areas. The current system, Transparency International argued, allows for public hearings of corruption matters through the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity. “The ability to hold public hearings in certain circumstances is essential,” the submission said. “The CIC would be a retrograde step as it winds back existing (ACLEI) powers to hold public hearings in respect of the bulk of the agency’s operations.” It says the commission’s differing treatment of politicians and law enforcement is a fundamental failing, and warns the “commission must be fair and equitable in its treatment of all federal public officials irrespective of status or role”. “The proposed CIC model does not yet meet the necessary criteria to render it effective and credible,” the submission says. “The two-division model is a fundamental flaw that predicates other significant shortcomings.” Transparency International said, however, that the CIC model could be saved with significant changes. It also said the proposed funding levels were a good starting point. Its criticisms have been echoed by other thinktanks and anti-corruption groups. Earlier this week, the National Integrity Committee, a group of retired judges, said the legislation as drafted could leave ministers exempt from investigation.   Related: Minister described $30m western Sydney airport land purchase as 'perfectly sensible'   The judges also warned that the requirement for “reasonable suspicion” before a corruption investigation begins would prevent preliminary investigation being carried out. Anthony Whealy, a former New South Wales supreme court judge and member of the committee, said the shortcomings left the body “disastrously short” of being effective. “The government has fought for years against any proposal for a federal anti-corruption body,” he said. “Now it has put forward a proposal essentially designed to protect themselves, and to shield the public sector from proper scrutiny.” The Centre for Public Integrity has also warned against the proposed model. In a November briefing paper, the Centre for Public Integrity warned the draft legislation prevented the CIC from conducting own-motion investigations of law enforcement corruption and did not allow it to make findings of corrupt conduct for parliamentarians or public servants. The legislation also would not operate retrospectively. “We look forward to seeing the Bill modified as required over the next six months so that the objective of creating a serious Commonwealth Integrity Commission can be achieved,” the briefing paper said.\\n\",\n",

       "  'title': 'Monsters: A Reckoning by Alison Croggon review – beware the many-tentacled beast of empire',\n",
       "  'full_article': ' Alison Croggon doesn’t wish her sister harm. She dreads the thought of any rogue accident or illness that might drag her back into what she experienced as the poisonous tangle of their relationship. Monsters: A Reckoning is a tale of siblings torn apart by a shared past – one sister’s wounded memories of the other. “Her suffering must always be much greater than the suffering of others – but what if it actually is? What then? No, I couldn’t bear it,” Croggon admits. “What kind of person reacts like that?” she asks us, or perhaps only herself. “What sort of person is cruel enough to write it down? Some kind of monster. Me, it seems.” Estrangement is not a linear beast, Croggon shows us, it’s a snarl of history, inheritance, enculturation, memory and layers of un-salved pain. “When I think of what happened between me and my sister, it all seems – it all is – so irredeemably trivial,” she writes. “There’s no totalising trauma that explains everything, no single catastrophe or series of events that might give this narrative a shocking centre from which can radiate the desired paths of sorrow and expiation.”   Related: Friends & Dark Shapes by Kavita Bedford review – an intimate, epiphanic portrait of millennial city life   And so Monsters rejects the easy causal logic of blame. Croggon’s book is not a tally of sisterly wrongs – a chronology of slights – it’s an unsparing cultural and self reckoning. “I was born as part of a monstrous structure – the grotesque, hideous, ugly, ghastly, gruesome, horrible relations of power that constituted colonial Britain,” she writes. Beware the many-tentacled monster of empire. Croggon is an art-maker: a poet, librettist, fantasy novelist and playwright, not to mention an assured and respected arts critic. With Monsters, she tackles one of contemporary literature’s most electric (and eclectic) forms – a kind of glorious literary mutant that braids socio-cultural contemplation and memoir; anchoring high-theory with visceral intimacy. She joins a sorority of glittering thinkers: Maggie Nelson, Kate Zambreno, Rebecca Solnit and Olivia Laing – and closer to home, Ellena Savage and Maria Tumarkin – women whose work mimics what it feels like to stretch an idea out in your brain. True to type, Monsters is digressive, kaleidoscopic, and alive with questions. “I find myself tempted to write something like a thesis, an account that … travels the authorised paths towards an impeccably argued conclusion,” she writes. “But something inside me rebels.” Tracing her ancestry from mercenary sieges in Iraq to the last gasp of apartheid, Croggon finds colonial patterns of dominion and violence replicated within the “primordial quarrels” of her white, middle-class, British-Aussie family. For what is a family, she argues, but an “empire in miniature”. “The damage was handed down, generation to generation, a damage that was understood and reproduced as privilege.” Her parents’ volatile marriage is the sisters’ shared wound, and Croggon wheels between her jagged memories of its disintegration, and the social pathologies it reflects (and perpetuated): the grand narcissism of whiteness; colonisation’s trauma machinery; and the policing, erasure and shaming of women – that old patriarchal song. To read Monsters is to stand in a roiling sea of ideas: from Herman Melville to Rachel Doležal; the symbolic savagery of sharks; self-hood, muse-hood and why we write. Books like this – fragmented and ruminative – often demand a participative kind of reading, where the reader is left to complete the intellectual circuit; that’s the grand draw of them, that immersive, neural fizz. Yet there’s little space for a reader in Monsters. We can feel an associative logic here, as muscled and purposeful as an undertow, but it threatens to pull us under rather than along. What does Croggon want from us: company, judgement, absolution? An audience perhaps, or simply a mirror?   Related: The Performance by Claire Thomas review – Samuel Beckett and the inner lives of women   And for all this book’s moments of auto-didactic brilliance, there’s no escaping its cruelty – it’s a pain-sodden, heart-sore cruelty, but cruelty nonetheless. Croggon’s sister is damned in these pages. She’s reduced to her worst self, a venal caricature, a cipher. And Croggon knows it (though she does not spare herself either). “I don’t know her story at all,” she writes, “I can only glimpse it through the distorted lenses of our dysfunctional relationship”. Monsters is often so red-raw – so scathing – that reading it feels like some kind of intrusion. It makes for a discomforting book, in ways that feel too-private, but in ways that feel productive, too – a necessary unease. As Australia’s sons and daughters of empire grapple with their dark inheritance, it’s powerful to see a writer connect the grand sweep of history to her own; to trace it’s echoes in the language she loves, and give names to our shared monsters. “Are we irreparably broken by our histories?” Croggon asks, but she has no answer. Not yet. It’s enough, for now, to have traced out the shape of the question. • Monsters: A Reckoning by Alison Croggon is out now through Scribe\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'Townsville police used controversial neck hold on Indigenous man before he died in 2018, coroner told',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Townsville police used a controversial neck hold banned in jurisdictions across the world during the arrest of an Indigenous man who died in 2018, court documents show. The 39-year-old, known as Noomba for cultural reasons, was arrested after his wife called police because she was concerned about his mental wellbeing. Two constables who attended were unable to find him when they first attended the couple’s house late on the night of 9 February, 2018 but came across Noomba about three hours later when called to another job nearby. The officers say Noomba attempted to strike one of them before he was chased and tackled to the ground. The officer, who it is claimed Noomba attempted to strike, used a police technique known as a lateral vascular neck restraint (LVNR) hold while trying to restrain Noomba, Guardian Australia can reveal. According to documents before the Queensland coroner, the officer says he used the hold to take Noomba to the ground, before pressure was placed on his back by the other officer while handcuffs could be applied.   Related: Townsville police condemn vigilante action after death of 22-year-old woman   Noomba lost consciousness soon afterwards, as his family watched, and could not be revived. The use of the LVNR, which involves compressing arteries and veins in the neck to decrease blood supply to the brain, will be examined during an inquest by the Queensland coroner. A pre-inquest hearing was held last month, more than three years after the death, with the inquest expected to start in April. The inquest is also expected to examine the conduct of Queensland ambulance service paramedics, who were on the scene when Noomba died. The death was captured on CCTV, body-worn cameras and in vision taken by the family. Police were told before the arrest that Noomba had a history of heart problems and had been inhaling petrol on the night he died – both factors which can lead to breathing difficulties. The Queensland police service manual states that officers should not use the hold unless “an incident is assessed as high-risk and there is an immediate operational necessity to apply the restraint” or they are “acting or aiding in self-defence”. It also states that officers should “immediately cease maximum compression but maintain control” once the subject starts to comply, or another “force technique”, such as handcuffs, can be used. Other Australian state and territory police forces, including New South Wales, have banned the use of neck restraints, but most permit a “reasonable” use of force during arrests. Aside from the use of the LNVR, the force applied to Noomba while he was on the ground will also be examined at the inquest. In 2018, Guardian Australia reported on two brothers who died in separate incidents while being restrained face down by police and hospital guards. Since 2008, prone restraint had been implicated in the deaths of 24 people in Australia. In the US, the hold, and similar vascular holds, came under renewed scrutiny after the death of George Floyd last year, causing several US cities including Minneapolis, San Diego and Phoenix to ban them. Other US cities had banned the holds decades earlier. Serious injuries have been suffered by police officers during training on how to use the hold, including two Fort Wayne police in 2019 and a Louisiana officer who suffered a stroke in 2015. Campaign Zero, an organisation dedicated to preventing the killing of US civilians by police, recommends the prohibition of LNVR holds.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'Chinese students in Australia fear reprisals at home if they speak out, inquiry hears',\n",
       "  'full_article': \"Chinese students in Australia are afraid to speak out on politically sensitive issues because of potential repercussions for relatives back home, a parliamentary inquiry has been told. Human Rights Watch has said its ongoing research into academic freedom in Australia had found anxiety and loneliness among Chinese students, with some engaging in self-censorship to avoid a backlash from Beijing. Addressing an inquiry into foreign interference in the university sector, Sophie McNeill, a researcher for Human Rights Watch Australia, said on Thursday there was “a very deep fear of being watched, of being reported on”.   Related: Liberal senator looking for 'heroes' not just 'villains' at inquiry into universities' foreign links   McNeill, a former ABC journalist who has been leading the research project, said Human Rights Watch had so far conducted about 50 interviews, including about 25 with students from Hong Kong and mainland China and about 25 with academics who study China or teach Chinese students. Students who had suffered harassment and intimidation generally did not report this to the universities, because they “didn’t feel that universities could do anything or that they didn’t care”. Students also expressed “a lot of anxiety [as] they didn’t know where to turn, they felt very lonely, very unsupported”, McNeill said. Some students indicated that they never said anything in class because they believed they could not freely express themselves. “All these very young people who said that their greatest fear was their parents being visited back in China because of something they said or did or participated in while they were in Australia,” McNeill told the joint committee on intelligence and security in Canberra. “While that didn’t happen to a huge number of people, we verified at least four cases where that did happen. So of course when that happens, it goes along the grapevine – everyone is really worried about that happening. “A lot of the students we interviewed expressed quite a lot of surprise that they’d come all the way here to only still feel that they lived in a system similar to what they were living in under the CCP [Chinese Communist party] in China.” McNeill said she was aware of a student who had attended a pro-Hong Kong democracy protest later receiving a message on Facebook from someone who participated in a counter-protest. The message threatened to report the student to the Chinese consulate. The researchers had interviewed about 25 academics, “who talked about how much they struggle to just talk about China these days in universities”. McNeill said an academic at a university in Victoria was recently “doxxed” – had her personal information shared online – after telling a student it had been unacceptable for them to send a group email reprimanding a classmate for describing Taiwan as their place of origin – rather than recognising it as part of China. Academics feared “being recorded by their students, doxxed if they say something controversial about Hong Kong or Xinjiang and that could risk perhaps family back home in China if they’re of Chinese background, or it could endanger their ability to travel to China in the future”. Elaine Pearson, the Australia director of Human Rights Watch, told the same inquiry some Australian government departments and universities appeared reluctant to acknowledge that China was the “one government that is behaving in this way and that is orchestrating a lot of these threats and intimidation faced by students from China”. Pearson said while other governments might raise concerns about activity on Australian campuses – for example, the Indonesian government might seek the cancellation of a West Papua protest – “you don’t see universities caving to the demands of those other governments in the way that they do cave to the demands of the Chinese government”. “I mean you had the Dalai Lama event moved off Sydney University’s campus to be held somewhere else,” Pearson said, linking it to the sector’s reliance on revenue from Chinese students. Pearson – who is also an adjunct professor at the University of New South Wales – said she had been disappointed about the handling of an incident last year when comments she made criticising Beijing’s crackdown in Hong Kong were initially taken down by the university after a backlash. Drew Pavlou, a student activist who was suspended by the University of Queensland after counter-protesters clashed with him in 2019, told the inquiry he believed he was targeted for political reasons to protect the university’s relationship with China. “The most troubling part about my experience was the kind of stifling effect it has had on free speech in our universities,” Pavlou said.   Related: 'Significant overreach': universities say Australia's foreign veto bill erodes autonomy   The head of spy agency Asio, Mike Burgess, said his organisation did not concern itself with peaceful protests, but “we would be concerned, however, if a foreign government is active behind the scenes trying to covertly shut down free expression”. “Some foreign governments – and it’s more than one – care about what their students get up to on campus … and in some cases they might use or want to use their students to counter certain things that are being said on campus as students go about their free speech, or universities and the curriculum they’re teaching might be a problem for certain nation states,” Burgess told the inquiry. “One country, in particular, is highly active, but they are not alone in that endeavour,” he added, without naming the country. Asked whether he believed foreign governments were working through student societies to advance their interests covertly, Burgess said he would not want answer that in a public forum. Burgess backed the need for universities to be given more clarity about which research or technologies the government considered particularly sensitive. He conceded there was currently “some ambiguity there at this stage, which is unhelpful to researchers, students and research organisations”. Chinese officials have previously denied interfering in Australia’s internal affairs. Wang Xining, the deputy head of China’s embassy in Australia, said last year there was a big difference between foreign interference and foreign influence, and that Australia would not enjoy affluence, cultural diversity and intellectual richness “without accepting some foreign influence”.\\n\",\n",

       "  'title': 'Gurrumul, Omar Souleyman, 9Bach and DakhaBrakha: the best global artists the Grammys forgot',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'This week I wrote about the glaring lack of international inclusivity in the Grammys’ newly redubbed global music (formerly world music) category. In the category’s 38-year history, almost 80% of African nations have never had an artist nominated; no Middle Eastern or eastern European musician has ever won; every winner in the past eight years has been a repeat winner; and nearly two-thirds of the nominations have come from just six countries (the US, the UK, Brazil, Mali, South Africa, India). The situation shows little signs of improving. Over the past decade, I’ve produced more than 30 albums from overlooked regions, languages and persecuted populations; one won a Grammy (Tinariwen), and three others have been nominated. My two latest books (How Music Dies, Silenced by Sound) detail inequity in the global music industry, and the vast numbers of people around the world who have been overlooked, despite being every bit as, if not more, talented than the stars who dominate the global mainstream.   Related: The Grammys have a major problem with diversity. Lip service isn’t going to solve it | Ian Brennan   Below are 14 of them, all from nations or regions that have never had a single artist receive a nomination in the Grammys’ global category, an award whose stated aim is to celebrate “excellence” in music versus sales or popularity. Many of these artists are legends in their home countries. That two have now died, and many others are of advanced age, speaks to the urgency of the matter.  Mulatu Astatke, Ethiopia Mulatu is regarded as “the father of Ethio-jazz”. He has not been recognised by the Grammys, despite Ethiopia being the second most populous nation in Africa, and the 30-disc Éthiopiques series being pivotal in bringing “foreign” music to the western world from the late-1990s onwards. Active since 1963, the percussionist and multi-instrumentalist is now 77 and continues to perform today. Entry point: Mulatu’s work balances funkiness with elegance in a way almost unheard anywhere else.    Gurrumul, Australia The blind singer Geoffrey Gurrumul Yunupingu, who died in 2017, performed ethereal music, singing in various Yolŋu languages. A multi-instrumentalist, he became the most commercially successful Indigenous Australian musician of all time and the first Indigenous-language artist to have an album reach No 1 on the Australian charts, winning nine Aria awards (Australia’s equivalent to the Grammys) and receiving 21 nominations, as well as the prestigious Australian music prize. As part of its mission, the Grammys’ global music category is responsible for representing pre-colonial Indigenous culture and languages throughout Oceania and in the Americas (outside of US and Canada, which are included in a separate American regional roots category) – but such a nomination has never occurred in the category’s history. Entry point: Gurrumul’s songs reflect Australia’s homegrown genre of country music, and the huge part in that history played by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.    DakhaBrakha, Ukraine DakhaBrakha are one of the most sonically inventive contemporary groups in any genre – and certainly possessors of the tallest matching hats. Three of the four members are women and, with their alternately tuned, cello-centric sound, they have wowed audiences across the world at major festivals such as Glastonbury and WOMADelaide. That civil war has rent their homeland since 2014 makes the celebration of freedom expressed within their music all the more potent. Entry point: The avant garde nature of their work bears more in common with Radiohead or Tyler the Creator than what many people might stereotypically expect when they hear the words “world music”.    Omar Souleyman, Syria It is estimated that Souleyman has released more than 500 bootleg albums throughout the Middle East, and his champions include the DJ and producer Diplo (MIA, Bad Bunny) and Björk. The exiled singer trades in modern electronic party music but the terror that has ripped across Syria for a decade now adds another layer of depth to his work. Entry point: The unforced cool and humor in Omar’s music have translated powerfully to alternative music fans worldwide, particularly in the EDM community.    OOIOO, Japan Incorporating traditional instruments, this all female post-rock band makes some of the most unclassifiable music out there. The group has roots in the Japanese noise rock pioneers the Boredoms, for whom frontwoman Yoshimi P-We was the drummer and trumpeter. P-We’s output over the past four decades has been staggering, traversing dozens of releases from more than eight different groups. She has collaborated with the Flaming Lips for an album, and also with members of Pavement and Sonic Youth. Entry point: Not through volume but ingenuity, OOIOO rock harder than a herd of death metal headbangers.    The Good Ones, Rwanda In 2009 I met and produced this acoustic roots trio of genocide survivors who went on to become the first artists to widely release original songs internationally in the Kinyarwanda language. They have since gained fans worldwide including members of Wilco, Sleater-Kinney, Fugazi, TV on the Radio and My Bloody Valentine, as well as Robert Plant and Glen Hansard. Despite touring the US, the UK and mainland Europe, the group continues to battle poverty and live without running water or electricity. Disturbingly, the press announcement for the Grammys’ global category name change this past November indicated an unexplained desire to distance the award from “folk” – this, despite the fact that more than 56% of those in Africa (and 83% of Rwandans) continuing to live rurally. Entry point: With the musicians’ rural and remote hilltop origins, the harmonic similarities to US bluegrass vocals are often eerie. Their leader, Adrien Kazigira, is one of the greatest roots writers in the world, in any language – deserving a place beside such post-Dylan writers as Jason Isbell, Vic Chesnutt and Lucinda Williams.    Rachid Taha, Algeria Taha, who died in 2018, was a legendary Raï music rock star. His lyrics were often outspoken against France’s treatment of foreigners and the post-colonial Algerian government. His song Migra (Spanish slang for immigration patrol) was recorded by Santana, and Taha collaborated with Mick Jones of the Clash and Brian Eno. Entry point: Rachid was a rocker through and through but always on his own regional musical terms.    9Bach, Wales One of the Grammys’ global music category mandates is to represent Celtic language and music, but the Chieftains are the only Celtic group ever to win, and it was for an album of Galician music from northern Spain that featured Latin music guests including Los Lobos and Cuba’s Pancho Amat. 9Bach are an experimental female-fronted group who perform in Welsh; their track Deryn features none other than Peter Gabriel. Addressing the challenges faced by non-English singing artists, their founder, Lisa Jên, has said: “We’ve had a few queries asking, ‘Why do we sing in Welsh when we could make more money singing in English?’ The answer is Welsh is my first language … and language comes hand-in-hand with your landscape, your culture, and the stories you tell.” Entry point: 9Bach create an immediate sense of place in their music, which emanates the splendour and mist of their homeland.    Fanfare Ciocărlia, Romania A raucous Roma institution, this year Fanfare Ciocărlia celebrate their 25th anniversary. Their 12-piece brass band sound has frequently been sampled by the Berlin-based Balkan Beats genre, and was even featured in the latest Borat film. Entry point: Ditching the forced zaniness of so many horn-driven bands, Fanfare Ciocărlia dive straight into the heart of organized chaos.    Da Arabian MCs, Palestine The godfathers of Arabic rap, DAM’s post-9/11 single Who’s the Terrorist? helped spark a Middle Eastern musical movement. The collective features a female rapper/singer, Maysa Daw, and actively advocate for women’s rights. Entry point: Da Arabian MCs routinely demonstrate the in-on-the-joke intelligence that heightened the work of such artists as the Beastie Boys and Nicki Minaj – and, unlike so many international hip-hop groups, the vocals are not rote cadences of US rap.    Luzmila Carpio, Bolivia This 72-year-old has been described as “one of the most important figures in Latin American music of the last 50 years”. Despite being pressured to sing in Spanish at a young age, Carpio chose to sing in her mother tongue, Quechua. She has steadfastly used her music as an expression of rebellion against the predominance of western cultures over Indigenous ones. She says she “borrows” many melodies from birds and even incorporates bird calls when performing, as an almost analog sampling technique. Her voice has been compared to a “violin” and Rolling Stone named her latest album, Yuyay Jap’ina Tapes, “one of 10 best Latin albums of the year”. Entry point: Listen for the high notes. Her voice is acrobatic, bearing more of a resemblance to opera than most traditional folk music.    Thomas Mapfumo, Zimbabwe Known as “the Lion of Zimbabwe”, Mapfumo was imprisoned without charge due to his outspoken opposition to British colonial rule. Now 75, he is credited with creating the Chimurenga music genre. In 2018 he returned to Zimbabwe after being exiled in the US for two decades. Entry point: Mapfumo translates traditional thumb-piano music into big band dance parties.    Huun-Huur-Tu, Tuva These throat-singing legends create otherworldly sounds via overlapping vocal overtones. Over four decades the quartet have collaborated with the likes of Frank Zappa, Kronos Quartet, the US blues legend Johnny “Guitar” Watson and the Chieftains. Entry point: The trance elements in Huun-Huur-Tu’s sound make for perfect headphone music. When they drop down deep into their voices, it is as though they come from the depths of the Earth.    Mashrou’ Leila, Lebanon This emotionally charged and innovative group features a self-identifying LGBTQ member in their lead singer, Hamed Sinno – something unheard of in the global category’s history. The quartet have released six records since 2009, often dealing with same-sex love in songs such as Shim el Yasmine and Tayf (Ghost), about a shuttered gay club in Beirut. The first performers to display a gay pride flag in Lebanon, Mashrou’ Leila have since been banned from performing in their own country, as well as in Egypt due to seven members of their audience being arrested – with one person sentenced to six years in prison for raising a rainbow flag at a 2017 concert.    • Ian Brennan is a Grammy-winning music producer, whose latest book is Silenced by Sound: The Music Meritocracy Myth.

       "  'full_article': \"If ever there is a case where the headline doesn’t tell the full story it is the news that Victoria’s Yallourn power generator – one of Australia’s oldest and dirtiest coal plants – will shut earlier than planned. The basic facts are clear: the owner, EnergyAustralia, had previously said the Latrobe Valley generator would close in 2032, and now it will be gone by 2028. Despite the seven-year-notice period, much of the initial reaction to the announcement focused on fears of electricity price hikes and blackouts at a distant future date. To some extent, it masked what had really happened. In reality, EnergyAustralia had made a deal with the Victorian government to keep the plant open longer than it almost certainly otherwise would have been.   Related: Yallourn, one of Australia's last brown coal power stations, to close early in favour of giant battery   Analysts have long expected Yallourn to shut early partly because it keeps breaking down, and partly because it is too inflexible to compete with the extraordinary influx of cheap renewable energy into the grid. With so much solar energy being generated in the middle of the day, wholesale electricity prices in Victoria have dropped 70% over the past year. This has been good for consumers and the climate, but bad for coal plant owners, who are struggling to stay viable. Yallourn has been hit harder than most. Modelling for the Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo) that assumed a slower grid transformation that that now underway had previously suggested the plant could close by about 2026. Some workers at Yallourn expected it to shut even earlier, and were relieved on Wednesday to learn they might get seven years work before it goes. EnergyAustralia linked its closure announcement to the global push to address the climate crisis, noting investors were moving away from thermal coal, and stressed shutting Yallourn would immediately cut the company’s emissions by 60%. But the company was open to sweating the plant a little longer when it approached the Victorian government to make a deal on the closure. The government says it will not release details of the agreement, citing commercial confidentiality, but it doesn’t deny there may be public support to ensure it remains available until that date. Victorian taxpayers could reasonably ask what they are spending to keep a 50-year-old plant online, and why the Andrews government thinks it will be needed that long.   Related: Australia needs to cut emissions by at least 50% by 2030 to meet Paris goals, experts say   The Morrison government’s response included raising concerns about what a closure in seven years would mean for grid reliability and energy affordability, urging the industry to build some form of replacement and leaving open the possibility it would step in if the private sector didn’t. It was a less aggressive echo of the Coalition’s response when AGL announced it would shut the Liddell coal plant in NSW by 2023. Then, the government pressured the owner to extend its life before warning the taxpayer-funded Snowy Hydro may build a gas-fired generator if energy companies were too slow to commit. The near repeat performance prompted some in the electricity industry to wonder: is this what substitutes for energy policy now? Based on estimates put forward by plant owners, eight coal plants are due to shut over the next 20 years. Most experts believe that will prove a conservative timeline given the pace at which solar energy is pushing coal out. A recent analysis found up to five plants including Yallourn could be unviable within the next four years. Dylan McConnell, from the University of Melbourne’s Climate and Energy College, has suggested we just bring the expected closure date of every coal plant forward by half a decade. Energy policy in Australia is rife with contradictions. State governments are increasingly backing renewable energy and, in NSW, long-duration energy storage through underwriting and price guarantees. It is starting to drive the sort of transformation in electricity, if not the rest of the economy, that climate scientists warn must happen more quickly across the globe. But few in power publicly acknowledge coal closures could come in a rush. Rather than introducing policy to accelerate the inevitable shift, the Morrison government criticises the state plans and rejects calls for a national policy framework that would guide private investment in the flexible energy needed to fill the gaps around a system that the energy security board says could be 60% solar and wind by the end of the decade. The Coalition, of course, abolished a national carbon price in 2014 and spent the years following fighting itself over a series of failed potential replacements, losing a prime minister along the way. Scott Morrison has gone to great lengths to avoid re-opening an internal battle over energy, including promising to pay for a feasibility study into a new coal plant in central Queensland to placate local MPs and Senators. It is the same split that has stopped the government from at least giving lip service to a target of reaching net zero emissions, a goal backed by more than 100 countries. The energy solution devised by the energy minister, Angus Taylor, is an ad hoc mix of policies that include promising, but so far failing, to change the Clean Energy Finance Corporation so he can direct it to underwrite “grid reliability” projects, such as new gas and pumped hydro plants.   Related: Australian farmers call for renewable energy zones as Nationals push coal and nuclear   Federal and state governments are funding new grid connections between the states. And there has been an initial wave of announcements of privately backed grid-scale battery announcements. But there is no overarching plan to to ensure a smooth transition if there is a run of coal closures. Business leaders and the energy security board have warned the private sector is less likely to build the new back-up capacity needed when governments are interfering in the market. Amid all this, there is a model for what a transformed electricity system will need. Aemo last year released a blueprint for an optimal grid that found renewable energy could at times reach 90% within 15 years, and between six and 19 gigawatts of new flexible energy capacity should be in place by 2040 to support it. This could come from batteries, pumped hydro, demand management programs and gas, but Aemo suggests new gas power – favoured by the Morrison government, and the only fossil fuel on the list – is likely to be more expensive than other options. The market operator describes the blueprint as an “actionable roadmap” that prioritises the public. It might be worth dusting off and re-considering before anyone expresses concern about the next announcement of an early coal exit.  Adam Morton is Guardian Australia’s environment editor \\n\",\n",

Photograph: courtesy/Sipa/Rex/Shutterstock   Twist, the two-minute-22-second-long video made by the London-born dancer turned designer Saul Nash for his autumn 2021 menswear collection has a plot twist. No spoilers because you should go and watch the film – but it involves the finest on-screen snogging we’ve seen since Paul Mescal and Daisy Edgar-Jones lit up lockdown one with Normal People. A fashion season without audiences feels lacking in many ways, but it has a very significant upside of democratising how the collections are seen. At a live fashion week, wealthier brands have grand venues and starry front rows, while independent designers play host in leaky car parks, but at an all-digital season every brand is viewed on the same laptop screen. The levelling of a playing field allows for a film like Twist, made in collaboration with Nash’s real-life film-maker partner FX Goby, to get the attention it deserves. Roll out the red carpet: Saul Nash is the next superstar of sportswear.JCM And the Oscar for most psychedelic film goes to … Collina Strada Rare would be the season when New York-based Collina Strada wouldn’t win the award for most trippy “show”, but for autumn/winter 2021, the label has outdone itself. In a year in which seemingly unending mundanity has made many a brain hanker after the out-of-the-ordinary designer Hillary Taymour and her team have upped the surrealist ante with models morphing into raccoons, snails, tree-frogs and praying mantids. The effect may be funny, but the message strikes a more serious note: ever environmentally conscious, Taymour’s collection has been made from vintage pieces, previous seasons’ leftovers and T-shirts repurposed from Ghana’s overloaded secondhand clothes market. EVB And the Oscar for best set goes to … Prada    AMSR-like … Prada. Photograph: Courtesy of Prada   There was something of the AMSR about the Prada show. That was thanks to a set that made fun fur its centre. The fuzzy, strokable fabric more usually found at Build-A-Bear and combined with, say, a candyfloss scent was given a high fashion moment. It featured on the floor and round the doorways of the set the models walked through. Endearing, nostalgic and a bit pop, it was also used on coats in a very nice collection by Raf Simons and Miuccia Prada. A Prada x Build-A-Bear is only a matter of time, surely. LC And the Oscar for ‘most 2021’ goes to … Eckhaus Latta A cold, dark void may not be the most glamorous setting for a fashion show, but it is perhaps apt for this bleak year.

There is no music to muffle their steps, leaving only the sound of boots on bare ground and the rustle of slashed and deconstructed clothes. “We were in a really bad mood,” one half of the design duo, Zoe Latta, recently told i-D of the vibe around the collection. What could be more 2021 than that? EVB And the Oscar for engagement goes to … Ahluwalia    The right stripes – Ahluwalia. Photograph: Laurence Ellis   The wounds and the healing of black trauma has been something we’ve been thinking about during lockdown. Whether that’s as a consequence of the death of George Floyd, reading Isabel Wilkerson’s Caste, watching Steve McQueen’s Small Axe or seeing the monarchy and media unravel following Harry and Meghan’s interview with Oprah. But in Priya Ahluwalia’s film Traces, we are being offered to think not about black trauma but black beauty instead. Taking inspiration from the painting of Kerry James Marshall and Jacob Lawrence traces meditated on the circularity of the generations, youth and family.

       "  'title': \"Steve Bruce blames club's coronavirus outbreak for Newcastle's poor form\",\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Steve Bruce has blamed a coronavirus outbreak at Newcastle United’s training ground in December for derailing the team and increasingly putting them in danger of relegation. Since the virus swept through the club, sidelining key players including Allan Saint-Maximin and Jamaal Lascelles for several weeks, Newcastle have struggled. They prepare for Friday night’s game against Aston Villa at St James’ Park having won only two of their last 18 games in all competitions. That run has seen Newcastle drop to 16th, a point ahead of Brighton – whom they visit next Saturday – and a resurgent Fulham. Their problems have also been exacerbated by the groin, hamstring and knee injuries which will sideline Saint-Maximin, Callum Wilson and Miguel Almirón until just after the international break at the very earliest.   Related: Steve Bruce battles the enemy within at fractious Newcastle | Louise Taylor   “We were doing very, very nicely until Covid,” said Bruce. “But it became a real big problem and now we are without three big players who we’ve spent a lot of money on.” Quite apart from being worth the best part of a combined £60m, Wilson, Almirón and Saint-Maximin are Bruce’s brightest attacking talents and his only consolation on Friday night will be that Villa are still without their own creative talisman, Jack Grealish. Even without Grealish, Dean Smith’s ninth-placed visitors are a team transformed from the days when Bruce was in charge at Villa Park and Newcastle’s increasingly under-pressure manager could desperately do with his former employers having an off-night on Tyneside. “There’s no doubt that Fulham have had a wonderful couple of weeks,” said Bruce. “But there are 11 games left, there’s a lot to play for and all the bottom six or seven teams are looking over their shoulders. There’s a long way to go but as I’ve said many, many, times, the buck stops with me. I will try everything I possibly can, with all the experience I’ve got, to make sure we stay here [in the Premier League].” Given that it was five years to the day that Rafael Benítez replaced Steve McClaren at St James’ Park, Bruce was asked if he expected to be sacked should results fail to improve. “I think I’m the wrong one to answer that,” he said. “I’m just focusing on tomorrow night; can we win? Then we’ve got a huge game against Brighton. We’re capable of winning the pair of them.”\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'Several EU countries suspend AstraZeneca vaccine to investigate blood clot cases',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'The European Medicines Agency has said the Oxford/AstraZeneca Covid vaccine can continue to be used during an investigation into cases of blood clots that have prompted several European countries to pause their use of the shot. The EMA said 30 cases of “thromboembolic events” or blood clots had been reported among 5 million people who had received the jab in Europe so far. “The vaccine’s benefits continue to outweigh its risks,” the regulator said in a statement. Several European countries have either suspended inoculations with the AstraZeneca vaccine as a precautionary measure or banned the use of a specific batch after blood clots formed in some people who had received the jab. Denmark, Norway and Iceland announced they were temporarily halting all AstraZeneca vaccinations to investigate the cases. Italy followed Austria, Estonia, Latvia, Luxembourg and Lithuania in banning inoculations with one particular batch of 1m doses that was sent to 17 countries. “The vaccine can continue to be administered while investigation of cases of thromboembolic events is ongoing,” the EMA said. “There is currently no indication that vaccination has caused these conditions, which are not listed as side-effects with this vaccine.” AstraZeneca, which developed the vaccine with the University of Oxford, said the safety of its shot had been extensively studied in human trials and that peer-reviewed data had confirmed the vaccine was generally well tolerated. Its vaccines were subject to strict and rigorous quality controls and there had been “no confirmed serious adverse events associated with the vaccine”, it said. The British government defended the vaccine and said it would continue its rollout. “We’ve been clear that it’s both safe and effective … and when people are asked to come forward and take it, they should do so in confidence,” Boris Johnson’s official spokesperson told reporters. Phil Bryan, head of the UK medicines regulatory agency MHRA, said reports of blood clots so far didn’t exceed what would have occurred naturally in the vaccinated population. “Available evidence does not confirm that the vaccine is the cause,” he said. Stephen Evans, a professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told Reuters that the decision to suspend the shots was “a super-cautious approach based on some isolated reports in Europe”. The problem with “spontaneous reports of suspected adverse reactions to vaccines is the enormous difficulty of distinguishing a causal effect from a coincidence”, Evans said, adding that Covid-19 was strongly associated with blood clotting. Denmark’s national health agency said it was suspending AstraZeneca vaccinations for two weeks because a 60-year-old woman who was given a shot from the same batch as used in Austria had formed a blood clot and subsequently died. The agency said it had not established a link between the clots and the vaccine but it had asked regional authorities in charge of the vaccination programme to stop using the AstraZeneca shot pending consultations with the national medicines regulator. Søren Brostrøm, the agency’s director, said it needed “to respond promptly and carefully when we have knowledge of possible serious side-effects. We need to clarify this before we can continue using the AstraZeneca vaccine.” Brostrøm said there was “broad documentation proving that the vaccine is both safe and effective”, stressing: “We have not terminated the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine, we are just pausing its use.” The Danish health minister, Magnus Heunicke, said on Twitter: “It is currently not possible to conclude whether there is a link. We are acting early, it needs to be thoroughly investigated.” Norway was suspending use of the vaccine “as a cautionary decision” after the Danish announcement, said Geir Bukholm, the director of infection prevention and control at the Norwegian institute of public health. “We await information to see if there is a link between the vaccination and this case with a blood clot,” he said. Italy’s health authority said it was banning the use of the suspect batch after being notified of “some serious adverse effects”, but stressed the move was precautionary and no link had been established with the vaccine. Media reports said two police officers in Sicily, aged 43 and 50, had died as a result of “severe coagulation disorders” after reportedly being inoculated with doses from the batch 12 days ago. Prosecutors have launched an investigation. Austria stopped using the batch on Monday when a 49-year-old nurse died of “severe blood coagulation problems” days after receiving an anti-Covid shot. Spain said on Thursday it had not registered any cases of blood clots related to the vaccine and would continue administering the shots.     Danish media said the suspension meant people who have had an initial shot of the Anglo-Swedish vaccine would not receive a second jab for the time being and all AstraZeneca vaccination slots had been cancelled. More than 142,000 people in Denmark have received a first shot of the AstraZeneca vaccine, according to figures from the state Serum Institut. The prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said the news was “of course regrettable, because we are so incredibly dependent on everyone being vaccinated”. Denmark has been ahead of most of the rest of the EU27 with its vaccination programme and has administered a first dose to about 13% of its population, prioritising care home residents, over-65s receiving daily help, healthy people aged over 85, healthcare workers, and people with underlying conditions that mean they are particularly at risk from infection.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': \"These US cities defunded police: 'We're transferring money to the community'\",\n",
       "  'full_article': \"After “defund the police” became the rallying cry of protests last summer, Democratic leaders spent months criticizing the slogan and worrying about its impact on elections. While party infighting was dominating headlines, local activists were campaigning to make the catchphrase a reality in cities across the US. Since the killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor prompted unprecedented uprisings, some racial justice groups have successfully pressured municipal lawmakers to cut police funds and reinvest the money in services. And with reformed 2021 budgets coming into effect, cities are slowly beginning to redistribute law enforcement money to housing, mental health programs, food access and other programs. “We are showing the country how reinvestments from the police budget can actually make many people’s lives so much better and safer,” said Gregorio Casar, a councilmember in Austin, Texas, who helped pass a major cut to the city’s law enforcement budget and is now reallocating those dollars to housing programs. “This will build momentum for changes to police budgets across the country.”   Related: Rodney King: 30 years after brutal beating, activists say LAPD 'still corrupt and violent'   More than 20 major cities have reduced their police budgets in some form, an unprecedented trend, though the scale and circumstances vary dramatically. The activists who have long campaigned to take money from US police are now fighting to ensure that the initial cuts are only the start – and that a growing backlash from law enforcement, elected officials and some community groups  does not derail their progress. A ‘paradigm shift’: $870m cut from police For years, local advocacy groups have packed city hall meetings, demanding “jobs not jails”, “care not cops” and “books not bars” – urging officials to stop expanding budgets for police and jails. They have argued that cities should instead prioritize the programs that have been defunded over the years that would address root causes of crime and poverty, like education, healthcare and homeless services. Local lawmakers largely ignored activists’ pleas, and police spending has tripled over the last 40 years, helping to make the US a world leader in incarceration and police killings. Even as cities have faced financial shortfalls, local governments consistently spent an increasing share of their general funds on police (despite repeated research showing that increasing police funding does not correlate to reduced crime). The dynamics suddenly changed last summer during massive Black Lives Matter demonstrations after video emerged of a Minneapolis officer pressing his knee on George Floyd’s neck for almost nine minutes.    Protesters gather in front of the State Capitol on 7 June 2020, in Austin, Texas, during a protest over the death of George Floyd. Photograph: Ricardo B Brazziell/AP   “Everyone on the street provided a new window into understanding and defining the problem of police brutality,” said Nikki Jones, a professor of African American studies at the University of California, Berkeley, who described a “paradigm shift” in conservations about police and systemic racism. Previously, she explained, political debates focused on “bad apples” and “implicit bias” – the ideas that brutality cases were isolated incidents and that law enforcement could be reformed with better training. But the uprisings brought mainstream attention to abolitionist arguments that the problems are institutional, and that the only way to reduce harm is to take power and funding away from police. With public pressure on them, mayors and city councils responded. In 2020 budget votes, advocacy groups won over $840m in direct cuts from US police departments and at least $160m investments in community services, according to an analysis by Interrupting Criminalization, an initiative at the Barnard Center for Research on Women. In 25 cities, such as Denver and Oakland, officials moved to remove police from schools, saving an additional $34m. “Folks might look at $840m as a drop in the bucket of the $100bn we spend on police each year, but it definitely reverses the trend of constantly increasing police budgets over the past many decades,” said Andrea J Ritchie, one of the Barnard researchers, “and it did so in a way that also secured the transfer of funds from policing to community-based safety strategies.” In some cases, the cuts came from leaving vacant positions unfilled or moving the accounting of certain police functions to other agencies – changes that would probably have minimal immediate impact. Other city leaders said their cuts were due to the Covid-19 economic crisis and not the protests, and in 26 major cities, lawmakers continued to increase police budgets.    A demonstrator raises their fist at a protest over the death of George Floyd near the White House. Photograph: Evan Vucci/AP   But for cities that did intentionally pass cuts, some of the changes were significant. Portland, Oregon, cut $15m from its budget and disbanded a gun violence reduction unit and transit team that had both long been accused of over-policing Black communities. San Francisco officials pledged to divest $120m from police over two years with plans to invest in health programs and workforce training. Minneapolis is using police cuts to launch a mental health team to respond to certain 911 calls. New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Seattle, Milwaukee, Philadelphia, Baltimore and a dozen other cities have all also reduced police spending. And some of these cities are now demonstrating the impacts of their new budgets. How Austin is spending police funds Austin, Texas, has made some of the most dramatic changes in the country, directly cutting roughly $20m from the police department, and moving $80m from the agency by shifting certain services out of law enforcement. The city has gone from spending 40% of its $1.1bn general fund on police to now allocating about 26% to law enforcement. “Public health and public safety are at the heart of this,” said Chris Harris, the criminal justice director at Texas Appleseed, a local not-for-profit. “When we take policing away, we are actually filling that void with alternatives that we know are going to help.”  Austin police budget cuts Sankey diagram  The Austin police funds were reallocated to emergency medical services for Covid-19, community medics, mental health first responders, services for homeless people, substance abuse programs, food access, workforce development, abortion services, victim support, parks and more. The city council is using money saved from the police budget to buy two hotels to provide supportive housing for homeless residents. “For decades, Austin has spent so many dollars policing homelessness, jailing the homeless, and paying for emergency rooms and 911 calls instead of reinvesting those same dollars to finally start reducing homelessness,” said Casar, the local councilmember. “By adjusting the police budget even just a little bit, we are going to be able to house and help hundreds of people with these two hotels … and I hope we’ll be able to buy more.” Austin has started redirecting certain 911 calls to mental health professionals – a move meant to provide help to those crises instead of a potentially deadly response by police, Casar said: “We know that we can solve the mental health crisis with treatment and care, not with handcuffs and jail.” The redirected funds are also meant to benefit the crime victims who have been traditionally neglected and mistreated by law enforcement, advocates said. Marina Garrett, a 25-year-old Austin resident and supporter of the defund efforts, has spoken out about how police mishandled her rape case. After she reported that she was sexually assaulted in 2015 at age 19, she submitted to a forensic exam, but detectives didn’t move forward while awaiting results for her rape kit, which was affected by a huge backlog.   We can’t just keep throwing money at police and expect them to change their ways and culture  Marina Garrett    During that time, the police forensic lab shut down amid claims of misconduct and incompetence, and Garrett’s case dragged on: “It was completely devastating. You wake up every day, and it’s all you can think about. My whole life was on pause for two years.” It took two years for the results to come back, and ultimately police and prosecutors did not move forward with a case: “I started to realize that police were no help … and that police were making survivors wish they had not come forward,” said Garrett, who is part of a class-action lawsuit against Austin police. With reinvested police funds, Austin is now moving forward with a new independent forensic science department. Garrett and other survivors have long pushed for the change. She said it was a small step to reduce some of police’s jurisdiction over sexual assault survivors, but that law enforcement remained largely ill-equipped to support victims.  “We can’t just keep throwing money at police and expect them to change their ways and culture, which is sexist and racist,” she said. “There are groups that are trained to provide support to survivors and help them find healing and justice, separate and apart from police.” Alicia Dean, a city spokesperson, declined to comment on Garrett’s case, but said the police department supported the change in forensics, adding in a statement, “the city is committed to improving best practices and outcomes of sexual assault reporting, processing, investigations and prosecutions. We want all victims to feel safe, heard and have confidence in every step of the process.” Fighting the backlash and ‘fear mongering’ One of the greatest obstacles to defunding law enforcement agencies are powerful police unions, which have long opposed reforms and negotiated strong protections in their contracts that typically make it impossible for cities to terminate or lay off officers. Unions have launched aggressive PR campaigns to counter the movement. In Austin, the Texas Municipal Police Association (TMPA) created highway billboards saying “Warning! Austin Police Defunded, Enter at Your Own Risk” and “Limited Support Next 20 Miles” – and put up the signs in September, before the new budget had gone into effect. The Republican governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, has also repeatedly threatened to try to force Austin to restore its police budget through legislation, and other state Republicans have spread misinformation about crime rates in the city.    Greg Abbott speaks at a news conference before signing a ‘Texas backs the blue pledge’ at the Austin Police Association, 10 September 2020. Photograph: Jay Janner/AP   “There are attempts to play up perceived dangers and to associate it with changes in the budget, without evidence,” said Harris. “A lot of the fearmongering that comes out of law enforcement is designed to play up racial tensions and racist myths.” Cities across the US that have made modest progress on defunding are facing similar resistance. In Seattle, councilmembers initially pledged to meet activists’ demands and cut the police budget by 50%, but ultimately backtracked amid intense police opposition, passing a reduction of about 18% (by leaving vacancies unfilled and moving certain functions, like parking enforcement, out of the police budget). Councilmember Kshama Sawant, a socialist who supported the 50% defunding, said it was particularly disappointing for the city to maintain high rates of police spending in a budget that made cuts to affordable housing, parks, libraries and transportation. Communities of color hurt by those cuts are the same people most targeted by police violence, she added.   A lot of the fearmongering that comes out of law enforcement is designed to play up racial tensions and racist myths  Chris Harris    “Tens of thousands of people in our city are reeling from the Covid crisis and the recession,” she told the Guardian, “but we have no hiring freeze for police.” Sadé A Smith, a Seattle civil rights attorney, said it was hard to see the budget changes get watered down: “While they are playing these bureaucratic games, people are suffering. That’s what’s so frustrating. It took so many days of marching and an unprecedented uprising to even get this little bit.” While there has been aggressive resistance to defunding from law enforcement associations and elected allies, there are also community organizations and local residents who have expressed doubts or concerns. The Rev Harriet Walden, a Seattle advocate who has long fought for police accountability, said she was worried about rising crime rates and feared defunding efforts could leave some Black communities and victims of violence vulnerable: “Crime is escalating … and people aren’t going to get arrested or charged.” Walden said she supported reforms that made it easier to fire officers who violate policies or brutalize people, but that she didn’t want fewer police overall.

Photograph: Jason Redmond/AFP/Getty Images   Sybrina Fulton, the mother of Trayvon Martin, the teenager killed by a neighborhood watch volunteer, also said she would rather see more police officers with better standards, instead of defunded departments. Merchants and business groups, too, have organized against defunding in some cities. Ritchie, the Barnard researcher, noted that the activists leading the local defunding efforts were survivors of violence themselves and that they have made significant progress doing outreach and education, explaining to residents that “cities have for years been defunding housing, healthcare, job programs, libraries, arts and culture and violence prevention programs”. People are often supportive once they understand that defunding police is about re-funding those services and making proactive investments in public safety and health. Activists across different cities were also learning from each other and recently launched a national website to pool together resources and put them in a better position to push for changes in the upcoming budget cycle, she said. “Organizers are better prepared and armed with shared strategies and much bolder and more detailed visions.” “Folks are getting ready and coming back for much, much more.”\\n\",\n",

       "  'full_article': 'Swimming and water polo When I turned 13 my father had just gone to prison, so without a father figure I looked for heroes in music and sports. Both my parents had been champion swimmers and when I was four or five they would throw me in the water when other kids didn’t want to swim. From the age of 13 to 21 I represented Jamaica in water polo, which my father had played. We trained a lot: 5,000 metres a day, 7,000 to 9,000 metres on Thursdays. It consumed my life but in a good way. It took my mind off my father being in prison. Water polo is one of the most physically demanding sports, and there’s a lot that goes on under the water that people don’t see. Hitting, thumping, kicking, tugging … all while you’re trying to breathe and stay alive and catch a ball and shoot! It’s a really rough sport. In the national team, we were trained by a Hungarian coach who called us pimps. “You pimps don’t know anything!” His compliments would be stuff like: “Man, you’re swimming like a horse today.” So I was a pimp, but a horse [laughs]. Eventually my focus turned to music but, after my father died two years ago, I started to play water polo again, to feel closer to him. Casio keyboard When I was 15 I saw [reggae production duo] Steely and Clevie on TV talking about how they used a computer to programme the sounds. They didn’t need a big studio or a band. After that, I wanted to become a producer. I saw a keyboard with a crack in it going cheap in a flea market and begged my mother to buy it for me. I lasted one term in piano lessons, but could pick out a tune and play it. The Casio keyboard had one conga drum, a kick drum, a hi-hat and a snare, but that was enough for me to recreate the rhythms of people like Steely and Clevie or Sly and Robbie, and sing over them. I had a cassette player so would press “record” and use the keyboard to build a rhythm, play bass and spit lyrics. Primitive recording! Then my brother got in with a sound system. In Jamaica, on the back of the 45 single, they would have the “version” [dub]. So I’d sing over those. I was 16, 17, and, while I didn’t get a record out until I was 24, that’s how I started. Nicole Wynter    In my teens, having a girlfriend was a big thing. I’d have one, break up. I’d have another, we’d break up. I don’t know if you could call it infidelity at the boyfriend-girlfriend stage, but in my late teens that’s what led to the breakups. When I was 14 to 15, though, my first girlfriend, Nicole Wynter, was the whole love and marriage thing, what you’d call puppy love. We’d go to the movies, start necking, find out stuff. After we broke up, we remained close friends, but sadly when we were both 17 she passed away with a brain tumour. I sing about her in the song Never Gonna Be the Same and there’s a picture of her in the video. When she got sick, I just didn’t know how to react. I always feel bad that I wasn’t there for her in the last stages, but I couldn’t handle seeing her like that. After she died, I saw her in one or two dreams and she was OK, smiling at me. I felt better after that. She was special to me. Conscious lyrics My teens were very up and down, with my father in prison and my girlfriend passing away. Between 13 and 15, I was taken out of private school and sent to Wolmer’s, the “ruffians’ school” in Kingston. When I was 17, my mother had a nervous breakdown and couldn’t walk properly, so I had a lot of responsibility. Music became my outlet. As a middle-class, uptown kid, I had always been told that dancehall music was not for us, but I just gravitated to it and became more aware of my surroundings. Growing up, I saw poverty, people suffering unnecessarily, and I would think about people having a harder time than myself and that helped me cope. I started writing conscious lyrics, trying to show the differences between uptown and downtown Jamaica and highlighting prejudices. I’d be singing about that stuff, but later on producers would be like: “Bro, this doesn’t seem like you.” They wanted me to sing more about girls and partying, which I was into, too, but part of me got stifled by the party guy, who attracted the ladies and made more money. I was trying to establish myself, so pretty soon I thought: “I like this party guy.” Bob Marley and the Wailers    I have known Bob Marley’s music all my life – in Jamaica, the Wailers are like our Beatles. We get played the nice songs, such as One Love, which are amazing, but between 17 and 19 I got more into the more conscious material – the revolutionary music, or sad songs such as Jah Live. I started to think about roots music. My favourite Marley song is Natural Mystic. I love the way the bassline starts out of nowhere, and it really feels mystical, like a supernatural power to me. I also love Mr Brown, a song from when Marley was younger, which is really funky. We’ve lost a few people in reggae recently: Bunny Wailer, U-Roy, the great engineer Barry O’Hare, and Toots Hibbert from the Maytals, who hugged me every year on tour and really encouraged me. Those names were iconic figures to me. I shed tears for all of them and will try to keep their memory alive in whatever ways I can. Their times will be cherished and they will be missed. English fish and chips My grandmother is from Coventry, and when it was bombed during the second world war, she came out of the air-raid shelter to find that her home was one of only three left standing. They moved to Rugby and she got a job in a drawing office, drawing plane parts for the war, working when she was 14. She met my Chinese-Jamaican grandfather after he went to study in England, she came to Jamaica in the late 40s and has lived here ever since. In my teens, she would cook me English food, such as bubble and squeak. She told me that fish and chips are best when served in a newspaper, smothered in vinegar, when the print comes off in your hands. When she told me stories about England, it always seemed so far away and we didn’t have the money for me to go there, but when I first went to Brixton it was just like Jamaica: spicy food and music! She always told me that she would love to go to the pyramids in Egypt, so after I became successful, I made her dream come true. She said: “It was hot!” She’s 97 now and still kicking; an amazing woman. • Sean Paul’s seventh album, Live N Livin, is released 12 March, with another album, Scorcha, following in May.\\n',\n",

       "  'full_article': 'Politicians, comedians, TV stars and journalists are among hundreds of women who have shared their experiences of feeling a sense of fear when walking home alone, as they expressed their sadness over the news a police officer has been arrested on suspicion of kidnapping and murdering Sarah Everard. The 33-year-old marketing executive vanished while she was walking home in south London at about 9pm on 3 March, and investigators searching for her have found human remains. Women also recalled their own fears about going home alone. Kate McCann, a political correspondent at Sky News, tweeted to detail what goes through her mind when she makes the journey back home on her own. “Keys gripped between fingers we map the corner shops we could duck into en route. Swap shoes for trainers in case we need to run. Keep our music low or turned off,” she said. The sentiment struck a chord among others, with the first minister of Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon, saying she identified with McCann’s message.  That there will be few - if any - women who don’t completely understand and identify with this @KateEMcCann thread tells us everything we need to know.Thinking of Sarah Everard and her devastated family. https://t.co/joEeCpBeYT— Nicola Sturgeon (@NicolaSturgeon) March 10, 2021  Julie Etchingham, a newsreader with ITV News, echoed this and said:  Chilling to read experiences in the wake of Sarah Everard’s terrible death.  Keys in hands, planning safe routes, shoes you can run in, talking loudly on phone - I’ve done all of this. It’s the sheer brain-space this vigilance takes. Imagine what it wd be like to be free of it.— Julie Etchingham (@julieetchitv) March 11, 2021  Police have scrambled to try to reassure the public after PC Wayne Couzens, 48, was arrested on Tuesday at his home in Deal, Kent, on suspicion of Everard’s murder.  The Metropolitan police commissioner, Dame Cressida Dick, said Everard’s disappearance was “every family’s worst nightmare”, and the arrest of a serving officer had sent “shock waves and anger through the public and through the Met”. Other politicians also shared their experiences. The Tory MP Claire Coutinho said: “Walking late at night recently, I remember thinking I’d better look over my left shoulder as much as I’m looking over my right so I don’t strain my neck. And always with keys out.”     The Labour MP Alex Davies-Jones wrote: “We are told: ‘Don’t get too drunk you will be too vulnerable.’ ‘Put your keys between your fingers when walking alone.’ When will we start telling boys & men not to attack women?” Labour’s Diane Abbott also shared her own experiences, saying she often crosses the street if a man is walking behind her.  Even after all these years if I am out late at night on an isolated street & I hear a man’s footsteps behind me I automatically cross the road. It is the habit of a lifetime to try & keep safe. But it should not have to be like this #SarahEverard— Diane Abbott MP (@HackneyAbbott) March 11, 2021  The Labour MP for Coventry North West, Taiwo Owatemi, said women were taught that it was not safe to walk alone “before we have even sat our GCSEs”. She added: “Every woman and girl deserves to live without fear of violence.” Anna Yearley, the joint executive director of the legal action NGO Reprieve, tweeted: “For all those women who text their mates to let them know they got home safe, who wear flat shoes at night so they can run if they need, who have keys in their hands ready to use, it’s not your fault. It never is. So many of us have stories of being assaulted. It’s never our fault.” The comedian and former The Great British Bake Off presenter Sue Perkins paid tribute to Everard in a tweet that read: “I feel so unbearably sad today. My heart goes out to the family, partner and friends of Sarah Everard.” The Love Island star Amber Davies also paid her respects, saying the news was “absolutely terrifying”. She said: “My heart hurts for Sarah Everard and her family. How can a young woman innocently walking home turn into this? Just sickening!”  The singer Nadine Shah said she had been followed home “too many times to count”. “Once I had to hide in a bush for over an hour until two men gave up looking for me. I could hear them plotting explicitly what they were going to do to me and laughing. The solution starts with respecting women,” she wrote. Women on social media are organising a vigil for Everard in Clapham Common over the weekend using the hashtag ReclaimTheseStreets. A poster circulating online says the event is a “vigil for all women threatened on our streets”.\\n',\n",

       "  'full_article': 'My friend Sebastian Stride, who has died of lung cancer aged 65, was for many years the heart and soul of the amateur music pub scene in Richmond upon Thames, south-west London. A singer and guitarist, he hosted open-mic sessions in pubs around the borough of Richmond, inviting anyone to sing, play an instrument or recite poems. Seb was born in Calcutta. His father, David, was a BBC employee in India, his mother, Conchita Guaglione, a Brazilian-born Italian artist who had works exhibited at the Royal Academy of Arts. Seb went to a nursery school in Calcutta, where he was once taught by Mother Teresa, before his family returned to the UK and he went to school in Fulham, London. Good-looking and with a cheeky grin, Seb left school to become an actor, settled in Richmond upon Thames and once appeared in a rep performance at the Richmond theatre in which Laurence Olivier starred. He went on to have roles in TV series including Doctor Who, The Return of Sherlock Holmes and The Citadel. His partner Cathy Bryant told me: “He actually received a small royalty cheque the week before he died, but sadly I was unable to tell him about it. He would have been chuffed.” He was best known as open-mic music host in the Watermans Arms, an old-fashioned pub 50 yards from the River Thames named after the boatmen who used to drink there. Last orders would lead to wee hours’ jam sessions at homes like mine, close to the pub.   Sebastian Stride singing London Years  The warm welcome he provided at the Watermans led to him hosting similar sessions at the local Duke’s Head, the Mitre, the Triple Crown and the Angel & Crown, always encouraging nervous youngsters or even oldsters to play and often accompanying them. He would open his sessions with one of his own favourites, often Billy Swan’s I Can Help, whose lyrics summed up Seb’s philosophy: “If you’ve got a problem, I don’t care what it is, If you need a hand, I can assure you of this, I can help … ” And right up until Covid closed the pubs down, he would often close with a ray of cautious hope through Michael Nesmith’s Rio: “I probably won’t fly down to Rio, but then again, I just might.” Seb was also a decent songwriter, best known for his London Years.  He is survived by Cathy, his children Sylvia and Nicolas, from previous relationships, and two grandchildren.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'Allow school trips in summer term, UK outdoor education centres say',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Outdoor education should be reopened because children in Britain are suffering, experts and celebrities have urged. In an open letter sent to the prime minister on Thursday, explorers, authors and sporting figures joined headteachers, councillors, charities and outdoor education providers to call for residential school trips to be allowed during the summer term, when hotels and B&Bs are due to reopen in England. Among the 200 signatories are the former England rugby coach Sir Clive Woodward, the children’s author Sir Michael Morpurgo, the Olympic gold medal winning canoeist Etienne Stott and the explorers Benedict Allen and Victoria Humphries. “Children and young people have been among those most impacted by the Covid pandemic,” the letter says. “As we recover from this pandemic … outdoor education has to be part of the government’s wider reopening of education, with both day and overnight visits allowed to operate.” With more than 2 million children a year usually taking part in outdoor education, the benefits to health and wellbeing are clear, the letter continues. But a ban on residential school trips since March 2020 has already led to 30 outdoor education centres closing permanently, with 6,000 job losses and £600m in lost revenue. The letter warns that unless providers can reopen at the same time as hotels from 17 May, the sector will face financial jeopardy, a further 10,000 jobs will be at risk and a generation of children could miss out on the often life-changing benefits of visits. Jim Whittaker, the chair of the Association of Heads of Outdoor Education Centres, said: “We can play a vital role in helping children get back on track to achieve their potential, but we need help to do so. The pandemic has been financially disastrous for outdoor education. But just as schools and children need us most, our sector is in an incredibly precarious situation. Without urgent action we face the devastating loss of provision for ever.” Disadvantaged pupils and those with special needs, for whom these visits are often a unique experience, stand to lose the most. Andy Robinson, the chief executive of the Institute for Outdoor Learning, said: “These are often life-changing experiences which, by their very nature, cannot take place in the classroom. If we are to rebuild the resilience and self-confidence of this generation of children we need to start that process as soon as possible.” Around 1.4 million children are on free school meals, and at least that many are unlikely to be able to have these experiences apart from on a school trip, Robinson added. “The industry is desperate to do what we do best: helping children fulfil their potential, whatever their background.” Sean Day, the centre director at the Lake District Calvert Trust, said: “We specialise in providing life-changing residential trips for children and adults with disabilities. If you can complete a high-ropes course in your wheelchair or abseil down a 30ft Lake District crag, then everyday challenges at home can become far less daunting. “If we can’t reopen this summer, the future of this amazing charity is at risk, and it is children with disabilities who will suffer. We are desperate for schools to come back.” Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, is due to decide soon when school trips can safely reopen. The School Travel Stakeholder Group, which represents providers of outdoor education, last week proposed a fixed reopening date of 17 May for day and overnight school visits. Under the proposals, centres would adhere to new Covid-secure protocols and ensure all visits adhere to the government’s school bubble requirements. “We are ready to play our part in the recovery and believe that the Covid-safe protocols that we have developed will enable us to open safely,” said Whittaker. “We have put in place so many safety measures to ensure we can operate with everything that schools and hotels do and more. We opened over the summer to families and didn’t have a single recorded case.” The letter also calls for a £50m culture recovery fund for school travel providers. A petition calling on the government to provide financial support to the sector has had nearly 15,000 signatures. A Government spokesperson said: “Throughout the pandemic we have kept our guidance on both residential and non-residential visits under review, in line with Public Health England advice. We’ve taken action to protect lives and livelihoods, including the extension of the furlough scheme and wider support for businesses to continue to support jobs.”\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'Rolls-Royce reports £4bn loss as Covid crisis shakes jet-engine maker',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Rolls-Royce has reported a loss of £4bn for 2020 as the jet-engine maker’s business was shaken by the coronavirus pandemic. The FTSE 100 manufacturer revealed it burned through £4.2bn in cash during the year as revenues from servicing passenger aircraft collapsed. It expects to burn through a further £2bn this year, but Warren East, Rolls-Royce’s chief executive, raised hopes that the company would generate cash once more in 2022 as flying recovers. “The worst is behind us as far as Covid is concerned,” he said. “There is cause to be optimistic about a V-shaped recovery,” he added, citing “very encouraging” data on vaccines against the coronavirus. Rolls-Royce’s revenues were among the most vulnerable to the pandemic because of its reliance on making and servicing jet engines for passenger aircraft. In the year before the pandemic its civil aerospace business brought in £8bn in revenues, compared with £5bn in 2020. The underlying loss before tax of £4bn compared with a profit of £583m the year before. The underlying loss partly reflected charges related to financing foreign exchange as it adjusted to lower than expected dollar earnings. Losses before tax for 2020 were £2.9bn, including £1.4bn in write-offs and nearly £500m in redundancy costs. Rolls-Royce scrambled last year to cut costs and raise cash when the extent of the pandemic became clear. That included cutting 7,000 jobs out of 19,000 across its global civil aerospace division, in what it said was the largest restructuring in the company’s recent history. East described it as a “programme of self-help”, reducing the number of UK manufacturing sites from 11 to only five. It has also negotiated two-week shutdowns of its engine factories this summer in an effort to save more cash. The hours flown by planes with Rolls-Royce engines slumped to 43% of 2019 levels. In 2021, hours flown are expected to improve only gradually, to 55% of 2019 levels. Rolls-Royce said it expected earnings to accelerate in the second half of this year, but even during 2022 it expected flying hours to be a fifth lower than 2019 as the slow recovery in international travel continues, in part because of new variants of the virus. It had previously expected 2022 flying hours to reach 90% of 2019 levels. Deliveries of new engines are not expected to recover significantly for a “few years”. However, even at 80% of 2019 flying hours Rolls-Royce would be able to generate £750m in cash during 2022, East said. A “reasonable worst case” scenario of 70% cash generation would be £300m lower, and it has £3.5bn of cash and £5.5bn of unused credit lines to see it through if conditions worsen. “Unless something fairly catastrophic happens we will be cashflow-positive,” East said. He revealed plans to gradually raise investment in lower-carbon technologies. By 2023, Rolls-Royce plans to devote 20% of its research and development budget to small modular reactors, hybrid, hydrogen and electric power technologies, as part of its efforts to reduce its carbon footprint. It currently invests about 7% in lower-carbon technology.   Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk   Rolls-Royce had planned to publish details of how it would decarbonise its business during 2020, but that was delayed until June at least while the company focused on making job cuts. However, East said he believed that the pandemic had made spending on decarbonisation easier. “We’ll see that the pandemic has accelerated the journey because it has sensitised people to their relationship with the environment,” he said. Rolls-Royce has not committed to making all of its products net zero. Instead it is relying the airline industry to dramatically increase the use of synthetic fuels made using carbon from the air. Those fuels would add net zero carbon to the atmosphere. As to whether customers actually used net zero fuels, rather than oil-derived paraffin that adds to atmospheric carbon, East admitted that it was “out of our hands”.\\n',\n",

       "  'full_article': 'British theatre needs to be “completely rebuilt” in the wake of Covid-19 to make it more accessible to people from diverse backgrounds, according to the director of a web series about the challenges facing people of colour in the industry. The actor Gabrielle Brooks started Blackstage UK in response to the various pledges to address structural racism in the arts, and says she believes the pandemic has presented institutions with the perfect opportunity to restructure. “Yes, we have the devastating effects that the pandemic has had on the arts financially, but we will survive [and] what we have been given here is a gift to completely rebuild,” she said. “I mean completely start anew from scratch.” Brooks, who stars in Netflix’s upcoming series Shadow and Bone and starred in the Young Vic’s Twelfth Night, said one change that needed to be made was making arts audiences more diverse. “I’ve stood on the stage and I thought to myself: ‘Wow, there is no one looking back at me that reflects me.’ Not only does it make me feel lonely, but it also makes me makes me feel like there’s no progression.” Research released by Arts Council England (ACE) in 2015 found that people of colour accounted for only 5% of the employees in some London theatres, in a city where more than 40% of people are from minority ethnic backgrounds. Another piece of research commissioned by ACE found that the biggest hurdles to black and minority ethnic arts participants were lack of time, the cost of attending or participating, and “concerns about feeling uncomfortable or out of place”.   An episode of the web series Blackstage UK.  Brooks said that some theatre makers believed having diverse casting meant they had addressed the issue even if the work reinforced stereotypes. “Dark-skinned black women are still playing parts where they are the aggressor or oversexualized,” she said. “Yes, you’ve put that black woman on stage, but what you’re really doing is presenting the world’s unconscious bias about that dark-skinned black woman.”   Related: Julie Felix: the brilliant Black ballerina who was forced to leave Britain   Blackstage UK features interviews with actors, stage managers and various figures from across the industry including Gbemisola Ikumelo and the It’s a Sin star Omari Douglas, who discuss challenges in the industry. Participants in the series recall racism and prejudice they have faced in the industry, from assumptions made by casting directors to hostile responses when artists have pushed to have their voices heard. In July the Black Theatre Collective, which includes Paapa Essiedu, Clarke Peters and the Hamilton star Jamael Westman, called for reform of the UK industry. The group had five recommendations, including that hair and makeup teams be trained in afro hair by this summer, and that the “appropriate skin tone makeup, underwear and physio strapping” be given to actors. Brooks is producing an episode on hair and makeup, saying it “feels quite trivial” to some people but is “one of the biggest ways that micro aggressions manifest in the arts and entertainment industries”.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'Bangladesh shipbreakers win right to sue UK owners in landmark ruling',\n",
       "  'full_article': \"British shipping companies that sell old vessels to be scrapped cheaply in dangerous, low-paid conditions in Bangladesh, India or Pakistan may now be sued in London for workers’ deaths or injuries. In the first ruling of its kind by any higher court anywhere in the world, the court of appeal of England and Wales has held that a shipping company in London selling a vessel in south Asia could owe a legal “duty of care” to shipbreaking workers in Bangladesh even where there are multiple third parties involved in the transaction. The landmark ruling means that Hamida Begum whose husband, Khalid Mollah, fell to his death in 2018 while working high up on a 300,000-ton oil tanker on the beach at Chittagong will now be able to sue the shipping company Maran (UK) in London. But by putting the legal spotlight on the notoriously lax environmental and health and safety practices in Bangladesh, the ruling may open the gates for other cases and force Asian shipbreaking yards to improve working conditions. The ruling follows decisions on two other long-running cases where impoverished communities in low-income countries were also given permission to sue multinational companies or their subsidiaries in London for alleged environmental pollution or damages. Last month the supreme court ruled that a group of Nigerian farmers and fishers could sue Royal Dutch Shell in the English courts over pollution in a region where the Anglo-Dutch energy giant has a subsidiary. Shell had argued that it was not responsible.   Related: 'Mollah’s life was typical': the deadly ship graveyards of Bangladesh   In a second landmark ruling, the supreme court ruled in 2019 that Zambian villagers could sue UK-based mining conglomerate Vedanta in the English courts for alleged water pollution because, as the parent body of the mining company working in Zambia, it owed the villagers a duty of care and could be held responsible. An estimated 216 workers have died in the past 15 years at the shipbreaking yards of Chittagong, including seven so far this year. Many more have been disabled or seriously injured. Work in Chittagong is well-known for being precarious, dirty and dangerous, but shipping companies have been able to avoid responsibility by changing ownership of vessels at the last minute, and using tax havens and middlemen. Hundreds of people, mostly without contracts, are injured or die every year in falls, explosions and accidents. The coastal environment is heavily polluted with oils, asbestos and dangerous chemicals and few people can work for more than a few years in the intense tropical heat without being physically injured.     London law firm Leigh Day argued that Mollah’s accident was foreseeable and that Maran (UK), which sold the tanker for demolition to a Dubai-based company, would have known it was going to Chittagong for demolition and should have anticipated the risk of injury to workers such as Mollah demolishing it. Leigh Day contended that the shipping industry takes deliberate advantage of Bangladesh’s weak regulations. The result, it argued, is that wealthy shipowners get the highest prices for scrap vessels in the practical certainty that they will be broken up in Bangladesh where health and safety standards are lower than in more expensive but safer yards. Maran argued that it did not control the ship’s ultimate destination and that there was nothing it could have, or should have, done to avoid the risks to the deceased. But Lord Justice Coulson said: “… the appellant could, and should, have insisted on the sale to a so-called ‘green’ yard, where proper working practices were in place”. According to NGO Shipbreaking Platform, more than 70% of approximately 800 vessels that reach the end of their operating lives every year are broken up in Bangladesh, India or Pakistan. Standard practice is that sales of end-of-life ships are not conducted directly between shipowners and shipbreakers themselves, but through demolition cash buyers who assume the credit risk, with the result that shipowners are distanced. Leigh Day director Martyn Day welcomed the appeal court decision. “The English courts have been shown to be sympathetic to these claims by communities whether in Africa or Asia bringing claims against British multinationals. “Whether it is oil-spill claims against Shell, mine pollution claims against Vedanta or this claim in relation to shipbreaking, London has proved to be one of, if not the only, capitals in the world where claims can successfully be brought,” he said.\\n\",\n",

       "  'title': 'Scotland hate crime bill set to pass despite row over exclusion of women',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Scotland’s controversial hate crime bill is set to pass later on Thursday amid anger about its current exclusion of women and assurances that the legislation will not criminalise those whose views are considered by some to be transphobic. Leading the final debate in the Scottish parliament on Thursday, Scotland’s justice secretary, Humza Yousaf, assured MSPs that the legislation balanced protections for victims of hate crime with safeguarding freedom of expression, stating that the rigorous consideration of the bill had “shown the very best of parliament”. The final vote was delayed from Wednesday, after a marathon five-hour debate over a lengthy series of amendments resulted in one of Holyrood’s latest sittings and concluded the rocky passage of the bill. It is intended to consolidate existing hate crime laws but also creates a new offence of “stirring up hatred” on the grounds of religion, sexual orientation, age, disability or transgender identity. On Wednesday, an amendment to add sex to this list of protected characteristics at this stage was voted down, after MSPs cross-party raised concerns about why women were excluded. The former Scottish Labour leader Johann Lamont argued that the case for including women – “who understand hate crime more than any other group does” – was “indisputable”. An independent working group was established last month, led by Helena Kennedy, to consider whether the creation of a standalone offence or adding sex to the list of other protected characteristics would better tackle misogynist abuse. But Lamont said it was wrong to “outsource our thinking to a working group, rather than wrestle with the issues of principle here in the parliament”. Joan McAlpine, who broke with the SNP whip on a number of amendments, told colleagues: “The thing that finally turned me to my current position was the government’s decision to expand the definition of transgender identity to include cross-dressers who are not trans identified … It will seem bizarre to many people that men who enjoy cross-dressing are protected from hate crime, but women are not.” But Yousaf urged MSPs to listen to women’s organisations, including Scottish Women’s Aid and Rape Crisis Scotland, which warned that a neutral sex aggravator could become a tool for domestic abuse perpetrators to use as part of a wider pattern of coercive control. “I ask members to give the working group the time that it needs to explore the issue, come forward with recommendations and create, potentially, a world-leading approach.” Holyrood did vote to strengthen freedom of speech provisions in the bill, after earlier iterations provoked an outcry from religious and cultural groups. Yousaf accepted one amendment from the Scottish Conservative MSP Adam Tomkins, who is also convener of Holyrood’s justice committee, which restated rights under ECHR Article 10 and emphasised the right to offend, shock or disturb, in relation to a reasonableness defence. Tomkins told MSPs: “So much fear has been stoked in relation to those matters that it is important to set that out. Criticising policy relating to transgender identity is not a hate crime under the bill. Even if you express yourself in a manner that others find transphobic, it is not a hate crime to discuss or to criticise matters relating to transgender identity”. He added that clear explanation to the police and the public was now essential. Tomkins and fellow Conservative Liam Kerr failed to secure an amendment that they argued would protect disagreements, for example, at the family dinner table.\\n',\n",

       "  'full_article': 'My wife, Sally Heaney, who has died aged 79, championed the movement towards child-centred education in the 1960s and 70s. A respected academic and exceptional teacher, she developed a research project in conjunction with Keele University that investigated the value of child-centred teaching methods. In 1975, while working in the education department of Chester College (now University of Chester), she established a playgroup there for disadvantaged children from the area. In order to enable children who could not get to the playgroup, she helped to transform an old double-decker bus into a playbus – so that the playgroup could travel to the children and be a mobile source of fun and pre-school learning. To help raise money for this project, Sally mobilised knitters from local neighbourhoods to create a giant Liverpool scarf. When it was finished it reached around Anfield – the knitters gathered at the stadium and held the scarf up; the event was covered by BBC News North West, as was the playbus.    The playbus converted from an old double-decker, with help from Sally Heaney, as a mobile source of fun and pre-school learning for disadvantaged children Photograph: handout   Born in Liverpool, Sally was the only daughter of Ida (nee Lawrence), a secondary school teacher and later deputy head, and John Hanlon, a joiner and cabinet-maker. Sally attended St John’s primary school in Ainsdale, then Southport high school for girls. She progressed to Keele University in 1960, where she graduated in 1964 with a BSc in biology and economics. We met there in 1963 and married in 1966. I also became a lecturer, in English at Staffordshire University. Following her PhD at Keele, Sally taught at Meerbrook primary school (1965-66) and Kidsgrove high school in Staffordshire (1966-68), before joining Chester. Sally was awarded her doctorate by Exeter University in 1997, by which time she was head of the PGCE she had founded and designed at Chester in 1987. She “retired” from Chester in 2003, and her last position was as a much-valued Open University tutor in Manchester and Liverpool, until 2016. Sally made a great difference to many hundreds of lives. She was tirelessly patient, always generous with her time, and enabled children and students to achieve their very best. Kind, brave, fun-loving, creative and tenacious, Sally inspired all those she taught. She is survived by me, our children, Anna and John, her brother, Lawrence, and two grandchildren, Alex and Ruby. \\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'New US vehicles must be electric by 2030 to meet climate goals – report',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'The US should ensure almost all new cars and light vehicles sold are electric by the end of this decade, and stop using fossil fuels for power generation by 2035, to cut greenhouse gas emissions in line with the Paris agreement, a new analysis has found. Joe Biden, the US president, should aim for a national target of cutting emissions by about 60% by 2030, compared with 2005 levels, for the world to have a good chance of holding global temperature rises within 1.5C of pre-industrial levels, according to Climate Action Tracker (CAT). Such a target would be substantially tougher than the halving of emissions by 2030, compared with 2005 levels, that many US civil society groups have espoused. Biden’s top advisers are working on a national plan for emissions cuts, called a nationally determined contribution, or NDC – a requirement of the Paris agreement. John Kerry, Biden’s climate chief, is expected to unveil the plan at a US-led climate summit on 22 April. CAT analyses countries’ commitments against the Paris goals of holding global temperature rises to well below 2C above pre-industrial levels, with an aspiration of limiting the rise to 1.5C. The latest analysis, published on Thursday, shows that the US as the world’s second biggest emitter, after China, must cut emissions by between 57% and 63% to remain within the lower limit. Biden has plans to ensure the US fully decarbonises power generation in the next 15 years, which CAT said was consistent with meeting the goals of the Paris agreement, and to move towards electric vehicles, though he has not set a firm timeline for the latter. The CAT analysis found nationwide sales of nearly all new light-duty vehicles must be electric by 2030, and that Biden should aim for cuts of 60% in emissions from residential buildings and 70% in emissions from commercial buildings, which would be tougher than Biden’s current aims of halving emissions from buildings by 2030. Emissions cuts of 60% for the US would be a stretch, but should be achievable, according to Niklas Höhne of the NewClimate Institute, one of the two organisations behind Climate Action Tracker. “If you take climate change seriously, this is what [Biden] must do,” he said. “It is a matter of political will.”   Related: How grassroots schemes across UK are tackling climate crisis   He pointed to the rapid progress made in recent years on electric vehicles, and the plunging price of renewable energy. “Things are possible now that we couldn’t have imagined a few years ago,” he said. “That’s why it’s possible to set visionary targets even if you don’t know how to meet the last five or 10% [of the emissions cuts needed].” Countries are already spending trillions on rescuing their economies from the Covid-19 pandemic. “Now is the moment, when a lot of money is being spent, to ensure it is being spent not just to support the economy but to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,” he said. Biden has also made clear his commitment to a long-term target for the US of reaching net-zero emissions by 2050, joining scores of other countries that have also announced a net zero target in recent months. Those long-term targets mean that countries responsible for a majority of global greenhouse gas emissions have now pledged to reach net zero around mid-century, a goal scientists say must be met to stay within 1.5C or 2C. However, few countries have short-term targets aligned with that mid-century target, or detailed plans on how to reach their goals. That is where NDCs, a requirement of the Paris agreement, come in. The deadline for submitting NDCs was last December, but about half of countries – including the US, China, India and other big emitters – missed the deadline owing to the pandemic. The UN recently published a report showing that the NDCs submitted so far would only result in a 1% fall in emissions, far below the levels needed. The UN now wants all countries to re-examine the NDCs they have submitted, and is urging those yet to come forward with NDCs to do so as soon as possible, ahead of a vital UN climate summit this November, called Cop26 and to be hosted by the UK in Glasgow. China, the world’s biggest emitter, is also being closely watched. Last week, Beijing published the latest five-year plan, which sets out the government’s economic blueprint for 2021 to 2025, but it merely reiterated an existing goal of peaking emissions by 2030. Green experts said that was too late to have a chance of meeting the Paris goals, and China may revise the goal in its NDC. John Murton, the UK government’s envoy for Cop26, told a UK parliamentary committee on Thursday: “We are urging all countries to make commitments consistent with pathways to net zero.” Nathaniel Keohane, senior-vice president at the Environmental Defense Fund in the US, said: “After four years of the US going backwards on climate and falling behind, while the UK, EU, China and others moved ahead, this is the moment for the US to demonstrate leadership and set a stretch goal. What seems very clear from all the analyses that have been done to date is that the next target should start with a five. “That level of ambition would re-establish American leadership on climate, supercharge American competitiveness, and galvanise global climate action as we head into Cop26. And as a range of modelling analyses have shown, an NDC of at least 50% is well within reach, provided the Biden administration goes all-in on climate action.” \\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'NHS poll shows rising toll of work stress on staff health',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'The proportion of NHS staff in England who reported feeling unwell as a result of work-related stress increased by nearly 10% last year as the Covid pandemic took its toll, according to the health service’s 2020 survey. The survey found that 44% reported feeling unwell as a result of work-related stress in the previous 12 months, compared with 40.3% in 2019. The proportion has steadily increased since 2016 (36.8%). In a year like no other for the health service, the 2020 survey also found a slight reduction in respondents who said they often or always looked forward to going to work, and a bigger fall in those who said they were often or always enthusiastic about their job. Nevertheless, the survey – which was carried out before Boris Johnson announced plans to give NHS England healthcare workers a 1% pay rise next year, prompting widespread fury – found that the proportion of staff who were thinking of leaving the NHS fell from 19.6% to 18.2%.  Chart.  In a year in which ethnic minorities were heavily represented in the death toll of healthcare workers, and concerns were raised about being more likely to be pushed into frontline roles and about access to personal protective equipment, the responses relating to equality, diversity and inclusion were not so positive. The proportion of staff who said their employer provided equal opportunities fell compared with 2019, with a decrease among black and minority ethnic staff from 71.2% to 69.2%. While the proportion of staff who said they had personally experienced discrimination from patients was unchanged from the previous year at 7.2%, the proportion who said they had experienced it from managers or colleagues rose from 7.7% to 8.4% – the highest level for five years. Danny Mortimer, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said the overall picture was encouraging in the circumstances, adding: “There are, though, significant areas of concern, and the recent data on the continued poorer experience of ethnic minority staff starkly reminds NHS leaders that staff experience varies unacceptably in their organisations. “With the government once again reiterating its intention to offer only a 1% pay rise, there can be no room for complacency when the results also show that around a third of staff are considering leaving their jobs and nearly one in five are thinking of quitting the health service entirely.”   Related: After an unrelenting year, stressed-out NHS staff deserve more than a clap | Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett   At least 230 NHS staff have died from Covid, according to an ITV tally last month, with many more affected. In January, at the height of the second wave of the pandemic, Labour said there were 52,000 NHS staff off with the virus. A paper published in the BMJ in January said black and Asian staff represented 21% of the NHS workforce but early analysis showed that they accounted for 63% of deaths among health and social care workers. Dr Habib Naqvi, director of the NHS race and health observatory said: “Today’s results of the NHS staff survey reflect longstanding patterns of bullying and discrimination … Ethnic minority staff have been disproportionately affected over the last 12 months by Covid deaths and infections, along with other concerning factors such as the quality and availability of PPE, allocation to frontline Covid wards and risk assessments of variable quality.” The survey, which received 595,270 responses out of more than 1.2 million NHS England employees, found that the proportion who said they said they often or always looked forward to going to work dropped to 58.7%, from 59.5%, while 73% said they were often or always enthusiastic about their job, almost two percentage points down on 2019. The survey results also illustrated how Covid has affected the jobs people are expected to do and the way they do them, with 18.5% of staff saying they had been redeployed due to the pandemic and 34.2% of staff saying they had worked on a Covid-19-specific ward or area at any time. Prerana Issar, chief people officer for the NHS, said: “Given the high level of work-related stress for staff caused by the pandemic, we need to maintain our focus on health and wellbeing and give them the support they need during recovery to help us to maintain care for patients.”  The headline and standfirst of this article were changed on 11 March to reflect that the survey was of NHS staff in England and not NHS England staff. \\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'Manchester City Women thrash Fiorentina to reach quarter-finals',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Gareth Taylor praised the professional performance of his Manchester City team as two goals each from Ellen White and Sam Mewis helped them to a 5-0 victory over Fiorentina in the Champions League. The 8-0 aggregate win ensured City’s place in the quarter-finals, alongside Chelsea. “It was very professional. We played with humility and maximum respect to Fiorentina,” said Taylor. “I thought the way we challenged balls, were professional and the way we managed the game from the first to the last minute was excellent.” If there was any expectation that Fiorentina might be a danger on their home turf it was quickly squashed when City doubled their 3-0 advantage from the first leg within 32 minutes, before Mewis came on at half-time and added a fourth and fifth. Twice Lauren Hemp provided for White from the right and those two goals sandwiched a penalty scored by Caroline Weir.   Related: Chelsea into Champions League last eight after Atlético miss third penalty   The penalty award was harsh, with Esme Morgan’s cross having ricocheted mostly off the face of the defender Martina Zanoli rather than her arm, but it was irrelevant in the broader scheme of things with City already four up on aggregate. In reaching the last 16 Fiorentina had gone one step further than last year, when they were knocked out by Arsenal in the previous round by an aggregate score of 6-0. However, with their league form having crumbled – they sit fifth in Serie A, 22 points behind the leaders, Juventus – any chance of an improvement in form against English opposition was slim. This was a ruthlessly clinical performance from City against a team that, at times, looked to be standing still as the ball was played around them. The visitors were without their captain, Steph Houghton, and Lucy Bronze, who were rested to recover from minor injuries. As they cruised into the quarter-finals, Taylor could also shuffle things further – at half-time Weir and Hemp were taken off, and the fresh legs of Chloe Kelly and Mewis came on. Keira Walsh, influential in defensive midfield, also made way for Laura Coombs, while White was taken off for the young academy graduate Millie Davies to make her Champions League debut, having featured for 43 minutes across four substitute appearances in the Women’s Super League. “What I love about this team is we make changes, we make tactical subs and it doesn’t change the performance of the team,” said Taylor. Weir added: “We’re delighted. The team was rotated, it shows the depth in our squad and it gives us confidence going into next week.”   The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.  The win extended City’s unbeaten run to eight games in all competitions and took their goal tally to 38 in 10 games. The draw for the quarter-finals takes place at 11am on Friday. “All the top teams are in there so I wouldn’t say there is one that stands out,” said the Scotland winger Weir. “We know whoever it is will be tough. “Both [English] teams look strong at the moment so it looks like the English teams are in a good place and that’s great for the game in England as a whole. If we can avoid each other, maybe that would be good so we can see English teams go far.”\\n',\n",

       "  'title': \"For women to feel safe in public spaces, men's behaviour has to change | Rachel Hewitt\",\n",
       "  'full_article': 'The disappearance of Sarah Everard while she walked through Clapham, south London, at 9pm on 3 March gives horrific shape to the hum of fear that women constantly feel in public spaces. My social media timelines are full of women who are distressed by Sarah’s disappearance, and terrified that it could have been them. Men have asked what they can do to help women feel safer. But what’s needed beyond the education of individuals are urgent political solutions to counter men’s attempts to claim public spaces as their exclusive domain. The fear that we feel in public places is so common that many women consider it a fact of life. A recent survey for UN Women UK found that 80% of women of all ages in the UK said they had experienced sexual harassment in public spaces, of which men are overwhelmingly the perpetrators. While out running, I’ve been chased by men, and it’s rare that a week passes without random male passersby shouting derogatory comments or making noises at me. The joy I find in running is diminished by fear. This fear is grounded in the knowledge that harassment can precede assault or even murder. In the space of just nine days in 2016 in the US, Ally Brueger, Karina Vetrano and Vanessa Marcotte were all murdered by men while out running. There is no way for women to know whether single instances of abuse will escalate, so we have to anticipate worst-case scenarios, and regard every cat-calling man as a potential rapist or murderer. Street harassment is how men mark out public spaces as their own, making women into trespassers on male territory. Behavioural psychologists have observed how male pedestrians crowd women’s personal space at cashpoints and traffic lights, how all-male groups take up more pavement space, and how men make more antisocial noises in public than women, considering it more acceptable to speak on mobile phones at checkouts or in train carriages. Women are more distressed than men by such unwanted public noise, and by having to challenge its perpetrators. We don’t know how these encounters might escalate. This isn’t a new problem. In fact, men have long sought to exclude women from public spaces and make them feel uncomfortable. In the 19th century, pubs, saloons and restaurants in the UK and US were almost exclusively male spaces. State ordinances forbade women from entering, or segregated them off into “ladies’ snugs”. In 1941, one male British pub-goer refused to use the word “pub” to refer to a mixed-sex establishment: “pub” was short for “public house”, and he reasoned that women therefore didn’t belong in a “pub”, in the same way they didn’t belong in “public”. In formally segregated spaces, women were generally only tolerated if they were there to serve men: as prostitutes or waitresses. Men applied a similar logic to all public spaces: if they treated all women on the street in the way they treated servants or prostitutes, it marked out those spaces as male domains, and suggested that women entering them consented to their own abuse. As the zoologist Edwin Ray Lankester, the third director of the Natural History Museum, wrote, if women “really do wish to be left alone”, they should “avoid the haunts of men”. The haunts of men were all public spaces, and it would therefore be “comic” for a woman to “object being spoken to in the street”.   Related: What would a city that is safe for women look like?   Many men today still appear to believe in a similar social contract. By abusing and harassing women, men make public spaces their own – and by entering those spaces, they perceive that women acquiesce to their abuse. Frequently the onus to prevent these behaviours falls on women rather than men. Many women will be familiar with advice such as holding your keys when you walk home, avoiding listening to music, not getting drunk, travelling on well-lit roads, or shouting “fire” rather than “rape” in the case of assault, because the former is taken more seriously. Rather than taking boys and men aside and teaching them not to harass, assault or murder us, the responsibility for preventing male violence has been placed on women’s conduct. We know that it’s a minority of men who rape and murder women. But a great many engage in continual, low-level, unrecorded intimidation that hints towards assault and is threatening to women who they believe to have “strayed” into their territory. It is difficult to overstate the damage this has done to women. Is it any wonder that we are much more likely to suffer anxiety and agoraphobia than men? Fear of male abuse has led women to give up once-loved activities, or stop walking or running alone. Women’s experience of street harassment rockets during adolescence, when many teenage girls retreat to their bedrooms, as “the only place in the world [they] feel safe”, as one told a researcher in 2001. Too often, women feel unsupported by authorities who are supposed to protect us. It’s difficult to feel that much has changed since a US judge refused to prosecute street harassment in 1976, because it was “generally accepted behaviour [that is] too frequent for a justice system to handle”. What’s missing from discussions about women’s fears is a focus on men. Men’s harassment and assault of women is part of a sustained, long-term attempt to roll back advances in women’s rights and restrict our presence in public spaces. Some well-intentioned individual men ask how they can change their behaviours to make us feel calmer and safer, and are advised to cross the road to ensure they do not walk behind us at night. But we need solutions that rise above individual behaviour, and tackle men’s abuse and intimidation of women as a systemic problem. This is an urgent frontier for women’s rights.  Rachel Hewitt is a writer and the author of Map of a Nation: A Biography of the Ordnance Survey and A Revolution of Feeling: The Decade that Forged the Modern Mind This article was amended on 12 March 2021 to replace mention of a 2008 survey on harassment with a recent UK survey. \\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'Italian volleyball club sues player for contract breach over pregnancy',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'An Italian volleyball player who is being sued by her club for allegedly breaking her contract after becoming pregnant said she was being treated as if she had done something “illicit and malicious”. In a case that has provoked outrage among politicians and sports chiefs, Volley Maniago Pordenone claimed Lara Lugli, 41, failed to tell them she was planning to have a baby when she signed a contract to play for the club during the 2018-19 volleyball season. Lugli, who was captain of the team, was fired in March 2019 after telling her employer about her pregnancy. She miscarried a month later and told the club she had lost the child. She also requested the €2,500 (£2,140) salary owed for the month she played for the team before finding out she was pregnant. The club refused to pay and instead took legal action against Lugli, accusing her of not revealing her plans to have a child in an attempt to extract a higher salary. In a court document shared by Lugli on Facebook, the club accused her of “disproportionately selling her experience” and “hiding her desire to be a mother”. The club argued that her choice had led the team to perform badly for the rest of the season and, as a result, the squad had lost sponsorship money. “When I read the legal document, I was so angry,” Lugli told the Guardian. “I’ve been playing volleyball for 25 years and had given it everything – they knew this. They said a 38-year-old woman should have known whether she wanted to have a baby and therefore should have said something. Not only did they call into question my professionalism but they are comparing pregnancy to illicit and malicious conduct – it’s a very serious thing.” The Italian senate speaker, Maria Elisabetta Alberti Casellati, described the case as “violence against women”, while Luigi Di Maio, the foreign minister, wrote on Facebook: “To think that a woman today is forced to choose between a child and her career is no longer tolerable.” Giovanni Malagò, the head of the Italian National Olympic Committee, also expressed his “solidarity” with Lugli. Franco Rossato, the head of Volley Maniago Pordenone, told the Italian press that the club had moved to defend itself after Lugli “filed an order with us to pay [the back salary]”. He said the club ended the contract by mutual consent after Lugli said she was pregnant, therefore not activating clauses in the contract that stipulated penalties against the athlete for an early exit. “Suddenly, many months later, we received a message from her lawyer for the presumed entitlement,” Rossato said. “Only then did we object and so activated the clauses of the contract.”\\n',\n",

       "  'full_article': 'Every woman can relate to the outpouring of stories about harassment and violence shared after Sarah Everard’s disappearance, the home secretary has said. Priti Patel said the “powerful” accounts reinforced her view that all women “should feel safe to walk on our streets”. She joined politicians from all parties in expressing sadness at the latest developments in the search for Everard, 33, after police found human remains, and a serving officer, PC Wayne Couzens, 48, of Deal, Kent, was arrested on suspicion of kidnapping and murder. The prime minister, Boris Johnson, said he was “shocked and deeply saddened” by the news and sent his thoughts to the family and friends of the missing woman. “We must work fast to find all the answers to this horrifying crime,” he said. Patel echoed the message and also picked up on the personal testimony shared by women online, who impressed on others how it was the norm for women to face fear on the streets. The home secretary said: “These are so powerful because each and every woman can relate. Every woman should feel safe to walk on our streets without fear of harassment or violence.” She added: “At this deeply sad and tragic time, as we think and pray for Sarah and her family, I will continue through my role to do all I can to protect women and girls from violence and harassment.”     Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, began a speech at the party’s local elections launch by offering his sympathies to Everard’s family, whom he said would be experiencing “unspeakable grief”. “This is awful news. And it has shaken all of us,” he said. “I’d like to say these incidents are rare, but the truth is that violence against women and girls is far too common. No woman should walk home with fear or threat. And we have to be clear: it’s only by recognising the scale of the violence, intimidation and misogyny that women and girls suffer on a daily basis, that we can ever start to confront this.” Other politicians have spoken about their personal experiences of harassment. The peer Martha Lane Fox said that when she was 19, she was “attacked in the street, pushed to the ground and kicked repeatedly”, adding: “I don’t know of a woman who hasn’t felt frightened at some point in their life.” The former Labour MP Anna Turley also revealed “we were all given a rape alarm in the first year of secondary school”. The Labour MP Alex Davies-Jones said girls were told not to wear clothing that was too short or get too drunk. She asked: “When will we start telling boys & men not to attack women?” Mandu Reid, the leader of the Women’s Equality party, has said the Metropolitan police should not oversee the case, given the arrest of a serving officer on suspicion of murder. The Met has referred the case to the police watchdog, the Independent Office for Police Conduct, which said: “Following assessment we determined that both conduct referrals relating to the kidnap/murder and indecent exposure should remain under local investigation by the force.”\\n',\n",

       "  'full_article': 'The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine appears to give high protection against asymptomatic Covid-19, according to data from Israel – a finding that will boost hopes that mass vaccination can stop the spread of the virus. The top line of the real-world results, issued by the Israeli ministry of health and the companies but not yet peer-reviewed by scientists, is efficacy of 97% against disease and death and 94% against infection without symptoms.  Israel is the first country to have vaccinated more than half its population, which it has done with the collaboration of Pfizer/BioNTech and an agreement to monitor the results. As of Wednesday, about 55% of its 9 million population had been given at least one dose of the Pfizer vaccine, according to health ministry data, and 43% had received a second dose, which in Israel takes place three weeks after the first. Last month a paper from Israel’s largest health provider, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, said the vaccine appeared to have 94% efficacy against symptomatic illness and 92% against severe disease. The companies declined to release the finer details of the results, on the grounds that they will be published in a peer-reviewed journal in due course. But Pfizer said the data confirmed the 95% efficacy it had found in its phase 3 trials of the vaccine, called BNT162b2, and pointed to the role the vaccine could play in stopping the virus spreading. “The findings which suggest that the vaccine may also provide protection against asymptomatic Sars-CoV-2 infections are particularly meaningful as we look to disrupt the spread of the virus around the globe,” said Luis Jodar, the chief medical officer at Pfizer Vaccines.  Graph  “Altogether, these data are critical to understanding the role of vaccination in combating the pandemic and provide hope to other countries dealing with this devastating disease, which has now afflicted the world for more than a year.” Uğur Şahin, the chief executive of BioNTech, said: “The real-world data reported from Israel demonstrate that BNT162b2 is exceptionally effective in fighting Sars-CoV-2. Our vaccine has been effective in preventing Covid-19 cases, as well as profoundly reducing the rate of Covid-19-related severe diseases, hospitalisations and deaths.” He said the findings were also important because the data was generated at a time when the Sars-CoV-2 variant B117 – known as the UK or Kent variant because of where it emerged – was the dominant strain. B117, which is highly transmissible, was responsible for 80% of tested cases in Israel during the study period. It now accounts for about 98% of cases in the UK and is also common around the world. However, the data shed no light on the effects of the vaccine against variants that have emerged in South Africa and Brazil, because there have been few cases of either in Israel. Prof Yeheskel Levy, the director of the Israeli health ministry, said the impact of vaccination had been profound. “Incidence rates in the fully vaccinated population have massively dropped compared to the unvaccinated population, showing a marked decline in hospitalised cases due to Covid-19,” he said. “This clearly demonstrates the power of the Covid-19 vaccine to fight this virus and encourages us to continue even more intensively with our vaccination campaign. We aim to achieve even higher uptake in people of all ages, which gives us hope of regaining normal economic and social function in the not-so-distant future.”\\n',\n",

       "  'full_article': '  Sign up for the Guardian’s Fight to Vote newsletter  Happy Thursday,   Related: Fight to vote: This is how Georgia Republicans are attacking democracy   There’s been a whirlwind of voting rights stories over the last week. Republicans continue to advance a wave of restrictions in statehouses across the country while there is mounting pressure in Washington for Democrats to do away with the filibuster to pass significant federal voting rights legislation. This is an indication of how voting rights has only emerged as an escalating issue after the 2020 election. Here’s a look at some of the key developments: Georgia The Georgia senate passed a bill on Tuesday that would make it significantly harder to vote by mail in the state after record turnout in 2020. The measure would do away with the no-excuse system Republicans implemented in the state and only allow people to cast a mail-in vote if they are aged 65 or older. The bill now heads over to the Georgia house of representatives, which last week passed its own sweeping restrictions to voting. New data shows how these policies would disproportionately harm Black voters. While the share of white voters who cast a mail-in ballot fell from 2016 to 2020, the share of Black voters increased from 23% to 31%, according to an analysis by the Brennan Center for Justice. Despite those changes, white voters still made up a larger portion of the voters aged 65+ who voted by mail in 2020. A different new study also shows that Black voters in Georgia are more likely than white voters to cast their ballot on the weekend days that could be cut. It’s still unclear whether lawmakers will ultimately choose to get rid of no-excuse absentee voting in the final version of whatever bill they pass. Top Republicans in the state oppose requiring voters to give an excuse and several Republicans, including the lieutenant governor, Geoff Duncan, refused to participate in the senate vote. The filibuster Last week, my colleague Daniel Strauss and I spoke with Jim Clyburn, one of the most powerful Democrats in the US House of Representatives, about how Democrats should approach the filibuster. The procedure stands in the way of blocking HR1, a bill passed by the House last week, that would require states to offer early voting as well as same-day and automatic registration, among other significant measures. It also stands in the way of blocking a new version of the Voting Rights Act that would require states with a history of voting discrimination to get changes pre-cleared by the federal government. Clyburn stopped short of saying the filibuster should be eliminated entirely, but said Democrats needed to find a workaround for voting and other civil rights legislation. He also offered a warning for two moderate Democratic senators, Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, some of the staunchest advocates of keeping the filibuster in place. “There’s no way under the sun that in 2021 that we are going to allow the filibuster to be used to deny voting rights. That just ain’t gonna happen. That would be catastrophic,” he said. “If Manchin and Sinema enjoy being in the majority, they had better figure out a way to get around the filibuster when it comes to voting and civil rights.” Biden’s executive order Joe Biden issued an executive order on Sunday that makes some modest, but potentially consequential, expansions around voting rights. Two provisions in the executive order stood out to me. The first requires federal agencies to offer voter registration if a state requests that it do so. This measure – long pushed by civil rights groups – could make it significantly easier for vulnerable populations to register to vote. Requiring the federal Indian Health Service to offer voter registration, for example, could affect up to 1.9 million Native Americans and Alaska Natives. The second significant piece involves directing the attorney general to provide voter registration information to eligible people with felony convictions in federal custody. That’s significant because people with felony convictions, and the officials who supervise them, often face a confusing maze of rules to figure out if they can vote again. In 2018, Crystal Mason, a Texas woman, was sentenced to five years in prison for voting while she was on supervised release (similar to probation) for a felony offense. The federal officials supervising Mason testified in court that they never told her she was ineligible to vote. The guidance required under Biden’s order could help prevent that kind of confusion. Also worth watching …  Iowa’s governor signed a new law that cuts early voting, requires the polls to close an hour earlier, limits who can collect an absentee ballot and imposes criminal penalties for local election officials who don’t follow state guidance.  Florida lawmakers advanced a bill that would prohibit local officials from setting up drop boxes for mail-in ballots, something that was widely popular in 2020. “I’m at a loss for words,” one Republican local election official told Politico. A new study found that mail-in voting neither boosted turnout nor benefited Democrats. Republicans in Arizona continue to aggressively advance restrictions on mail-in voting. One measure that caught my eye yesterday was a bill that would require officials to reject a ballot that arrived by the close of the polls on election day if it was not also postmarked by the Thursday before the election. \\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'Chicago suburb to become first city to provide reparations to Black residents for housing',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'A suburb of Chicago is set to become the first place in the US to provide reparations to its Black residents for housing through a tax on marijuana sales, with a plan to distribute $10m over the coming decade. Evanston, which sits on the shores of Lake Michigan north of downtown Chicago, is set for an initial disbursement of about $400,000 for housing needs, with a vote on the issue set to take place at the city council on 22 March. Under the proposal, residents would get $25,000 to use towards home improvements or mortgage assistance. To qualify, residents must have either been or descended from a Black person who lived in Evanston before 1969 who suffered from discriminatory housing practices by government and banks. This funding will be the first to flow in the wake of a landmark decision by Evanston in 2019 to financially compensate its Black residents for historical racism and discrimination. These reparations, set to total $10m, will come via community donations and a tax on marijuana. Robin Rue Simmons, a Black alderman who represents Evanston’s historically black fifth ward, said reparations were the “most appropriate legislative response to the historic practices and the contemporary conditions of the Black community”. Simmons said that “although many of the anti-Black policies have been outlawed, many remain embedded in policy, including zoning and other government practices. We are in a time in history where this nation more broadly has not only the will and awareness of why reparations is due, but the heart to advance it.” However, a group has raised concerns over the proposal, claiming that it does not go far enough to be truly called reparations. The group, Evanston Rejects Racist Reparations, posted on Facebook that “historically racist financial institutions like banks, corporations and various individuals” will profit from the move. The group wants the program to be called something other than reparations and for the city council to come back with direct payments to Black residents. Simmons has dismissed these criticisms, pointing out the council does not have authority over the banking industry. The National African American Reparations Commission, a non-profit civil rights organization, has cited the Evanston program as a model for reparations for the rest of the US. The US has a spotty records of discussing and distributing reparations in past decade, with most plans falling short or happening on a minor scale. In recent years, however, it has become a wider conversation: last year, Asheville, North Carolina, lawmakers postponed a resolution that would allocate a $1m fund for reparations. The mayor of Providence, Rhode Island, also signed a commitment to the idea for both Black and Indigenous residents.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'National Trust report on slavery links did not break charity law, regulator says',\n",
       "  'full_article': \"The National Trust did not breach charity law by publishing a report that found itself at the centre of a “culture war” after it made links between its country house properties and the UK’s history of colonialism and slavery, the charity regulator has ruled. In effect exonerating the trust of claims that it had acted outside of its charitable purposes, the Charity Commission confirmed that the trust had acted legally and responsibly at all times and would face no regulatory action. The trust’s publication of the report, which considered how the lucrative proceeds of Britain’s imperial past had helped build and furnish 93 trust properties, provoked furious headlines in the autumn, with some Tory MPs and media accusing the trust – one of the UK’s biggest charities – of perpetuating “Marxist” or “woke” views. A commission’s statement published on Thursday said that while the concerns raised about the trust had the potential to damage the charity’s reputation, it found the charity had acted appropriately in its commissioning of the report, and had “provided a well-reasoned justification” for why the report furthered the charity’s purposes. “The National Trust has been able to demonstrate that its work to examine links between its properties and histories of colonialism and slavery was carefully considered, and that it fitted within its charitable objects,” said the commission chief executive, Helen Stephenson. “I understand that this conclusion will not satisfy everyone. But I hope it is reassuring to those who raised concerns about the charity’s report, who said it made them feel uncomfortable and concerned that the charity had lost its way, that the commission has examined the trust’s actions very close.” A National Trust spokesperson said: “We welcome the Charity Commission’s conclusion that there are no grounds for regulatory action against us, following complaints the commission received about the report we published on historic slavery and colonialism links at the places we care for.” Among the measures the trust had taken prior to publishing the report included consulting a panel of 2,000 trust members, among which it found “considerable support for research into challenging histories provided the findings were appropriately researched and contextualised”.    Hilary McGrady, director general of the National Trust: ‘While we can celebrate and enjoy history we can also explore and acknowledge all aspects of it.’ Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock   Despite being cleared by the regulator, the trust will be counting the cost of being at the centre of a bruising culture war tussle. There have been countless newspaper articles, social media rows and two parliamentary debates on the issue since the autumn, amid reports of a supposed “revolt” among the trusts’s 5.6 million members. There are wider concerns across the voluntary sector, with many charities fearing that the hounding of the National Trust reflects a wider hostility from some rightwing politicians designed to create a chilling effect on campaigners. It is understood some trust staff received death threats as a result of the furore. A freedom of information request published in November by Third Sector magazine revealed the commission had received just three complaints about the trust report. The trust said it had received 771 complaints – or 0.05% of its 5.6 million members – and many in support of the trust’s decision to publish the report.   Related: Politicians should not 'weaponise' UK history, says colonialism researcher   The trust acknowledged that many of its supporters had been genuinely concerned about the report. But its director general, Hilary McGrady, suggested in a blog post on Thursday that the trust would not shirk from exploring the history of its houses and properties even where this was contentious or challenging. She wrote: “It is surely a sign of confidence, integrity and pride that while we can celebrate and enjoy history we can also explore and acknowledge all aspects of it. “The National Trust is at its best when we capture this complexity – when we present facts and material evidence in ways that inspire curiosity, inquiry, learning and sharing.” Another household-name charity, Barnardos, remains subject to a Charity Commission compliance inquiry after Conservative MPs complained about the publication on its website of a blog examining the issues of “white privilege” in the context of the Black Lives Matter movement.\\n\",\n",

       "  'title': 'Mississippi governor to sign bill banning trans athletes from women’s teams',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Tate Reeves, the Republican governor of Mississippi, is set to sign a bill on Thursday that will ban transgender athletes from competing on girls’ or women’s sports teams. Mississippi will become the first state this year to enact such a ban, after a federal court blocked a similar Idaho law last year. Mississippi’s senate bill 2536 is set to become law on 1 July, although a legal challenge is possible. Reeves, who has three daughters who play sports, has said that the bill is needed to “protect young girls from being forced to compete with biological males for athletic opportunities”. The governor added that the “push for kids to adopt transgenderism is just wrong”. But critics pointed out that the legislation was designed to discriminate. “It’s about erasing and excluding trans people from participation in all aspects of public life,” said Jett Jonelis, the advocacy manager for the ACLU of South Dakota. The bill is likely to end up in federal court. More than 20 states are currently proposing restrictions on athletics or gender-confirming health care for transgender minors this year. Conservative lawmakers are responding to an executive order by Joe Biden that bans discrimination based on gender identity in school sports and elsewhere. The US president signed the order on 20 January, the day he took office. South Dakota’s state senate passed a bill that restricts transgender female athletes from competing on high school and college girls’ and women’s teams. Schools and athletics bodies will be required to collect written statements that document each student’s “reproductive biology”. Kristi Noem, governor of South Dakota and considered a potential Republican candidate for US president in 2024, said she was “excited” to sign the bill, although critics say it may violate the Civil Rights Act by discriminating based on sex. Meanwhile, Alphonso David, president of the LGBTQ civil rights group Human Rights Campaign, condemned the Mississippi bill. “There is simply no justification for banning transgender girls and women from participating in athletics other than discrimination,” David said after the House passed it 3 March. “While millions of people in Mississippi are waiting for urgent relief as it relates to Covid-19, the leaders of Mississippi are not focused on that. Rather, they’re focused on prioritizing bullying against transgender kids.”\\n',\n",

       "  'title': '‘I teach at my old primary school’: how great teachers and happy times inspired me',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'I still have a little trophy that I won when I participated in a talent show at my primary school. My best friend (to this day) and I used to pretend to be our own girl band during playtime at St Mary’s Priory junior school, in Tottenham, north London. There’s an area in the playground with some steps that we called “the stage”. We thought we were the next big thing, singing Beyoncé at the top of our voices. These days, when I’m on playground duty, I sometimes see the children putting on similar performances there, just like we did. I tell them that I used to sing and dance on the “stage”, which they love. They get a kick, too, from knowing that some of the teachers still at St Mary’s taught me when I was there.    ‘My friends, singing and dancing, my lovely teachers: this was the epitome of happiness for my 9-year-old self’ Photograph: PR   My friends, singing and dancing, my lovely teachers: this was the epitome of happiness for my 9-year-old self. I started at the school in year 4, and at first I was really sad as I missed my friends from my old school. But being a Tottenham born and raised girl, St Mary’s soon started to feel like home, and I grew to love it. From a young age, I knew I wanted to be a teacher. I had such great teachers in my life, who always had me engaged and wanted to push me further. I even wrote into the local newspaper when I was 14, about how proud I was that St Mary’s had received a good Ofsted rating. “The teachers are great, the food is fantastic, even the assemblies are interesting,” I wrote, adding that one day I’d love to be a teacher there. After that did indeed happen, I led a school assembly about careers and used myself as an example of what you can achieve when you set your mind to it! Tottenham has been the victim of bad press over the years, what with the riots of 2011 and it being a bit rough around the edges. But the local community is so warm and supportive. I’m proud to be a product of Tottenham, and I’ve learned that it doesn’t matter where you’re from, anything can be achieved if you work hard enough. My story hasn’t been all plain sailing though. I lost my mum at the age of 15 and some of my GCSEs were impacted. As a result, my route to becoming a teacher was a bit of a journey. I took education studies at university, and then went on to get more experience in the field, working as a teaching assistant in various schools across London. Teachers that I worked with would often encourage me to take the leap and apply for a PGCE so I could become a fully-qualified teacher. With that encouragement, plus the support of my father and my friends, and thinking about what my mum would have wanted for me, I retook my GCSEs and went on to complete my PGCE at Middlesex University.    ‘I think the senior leadership team at my school recognises the value of bringing in local teachers,’ says Edwards-Hayde. Photograph: Amara Eno/Guardian   When it came time to find a job, I was encouraged to apply for positions at my two placement schools. But I really just wanted to work at St Mary’s because it was such a happy place for me growing up. It was my ultimate goal, so I waited until a job became available. I started working here, in my old year 5 classroom, in September 2019 and haven’t looked back. It’s funny because I work alongside some of the teachers who taught me and my brothers. Getting the opportunity to work with the teaching assistant from when I was in year 6 makes me want to pinch myself. I was so inspired by these adults growing up, and now I’m incredibly grateful to be working with and learning from these amazing, experienced teachers. There are actually six teachers that were previously students here too, including the incredible headteacher, so I’m not alone! I don’t think it’s a coincidence that so many of us have returned. There is something about this school, and the Tottenham community, that gets under your skin. And I think the senior leadership team at my school recognises the value of bringing in local teachers, who really understand where these children come from. I’m known for my infectious smile – and my laugh can be heard throughout the corridors. My enthusiasm branches out into my teaching. One day I might consider getting involved in senior leadership here, which would really mean I’ve come full circle. But for now, I’m just so happy to have achieved my childhood dream. I’m thrilled to be where I am with my year 5s and to see them smiling and enjoying learning. In time, I hope they will cherish the memories they’re making here, just like I do.

       "  'title': 'NHS England waiting times reached record high in January',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'The number of people waiting for medical treatment in England reached a record high in January for the second month running. Figures from NHS England show 4.59 million people were waiting to start treatment at the end of January – the highest number since records began in August 2007, reflecting the severe pressures faced by the health service due to the second Covid peak. The number waiting more than 52 weeks to start hospital treatment stood at 304,044 in the same month – the highest number for any calendar month since January 2008.  Patients are now waiting 12.1 weeks on average, up from 8.4 weeks in January 2020. This remains well below the 19.6-week median wait recorded in July 2020.  The number of people waiting for treatment in England reached a record high in January for the second month running.  Prof Stephen Powis, the national medical director for NHS England, said: “Admitting more than 100,000 Covid patients to hospital in a single month inevitably had a knock-on effect on some non-urgent care. “However, thanks to the hard work of NHS staff and the innovations in treatment and care developed over the course of the pandemic, hospitals treated more than 1 million people with other conditions in January, at the peak of the winter wave, nearly twice as many as they did last April. “That is a testament to the skill, dedication and commitment nurses, doctors, therapists and countless other staff showed in the most challenging period in NHS history.” A separate release also showed a fall in the number of people presenting for cancer checks and treatments, which were down across every single category this past January compared with the same month in 2020. The figures include an 11% drop in the number of people being seen by a specialist for suspected cancer following an urgent referral by their GP, compared with January 2020. The NHS aims to see 93% of these patients within two weeks; however, just 83.4% were seen within a fortnight in January, a record low.   Related: NHS England poll shows rising toll of work stress on staff health   The number of people in England starting cancer treatment is also down 16% compared with the same month last year. Macmillan Cancer Support estimates that 37,000 fewer people have started treatment for cancer than should have done between March 2020 and the end of January. Macmillan’s head of policy, Sara Bainbridge, said the newly released figures “cast a long shadow over people living with cancer”, adding that tens of thousands of people have missed out on a diagnosis due to disruption caused by the pandemic. Elsewhere, the NHS figures showed that A&E attendances were the third lowest on record in terms of all A&Es and the second worst in terms of type 1 (general) A&Es although the proportion seen within four hours in both settings was up compared to January. The overall number of people attending a yype 1 A&E in February was down 27% compared with the same month last year and down 35% across all A&E attendances. The number of people waiting six weeks or more for diagnosis of treatments including MRIs, colonoscopies and gastroscopies stood at 377,651 in January – down 34% compared with the levels seen in April 2020 – but still eight times as high as the same month last year.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'Charley Hill obituary',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'One bright morning in May 1994, in a summerhouse in the Norwegian fjord town of Åsgårdstrand, Charley Hill, a Scotland Yard detective, stared down a trapdoor leading to the basement. Below, in the dark, was Edvard Munch’s painting The Scream, stolen three months earlier from the national gallery in Oslo. With Hill was an art dealer, who had brought him to this secret location, and two men, hoodwinked by Hill’s pseudonym of Chris Roberts, who were handling the sale of the missing masterpiece. “I posed as a representative of the Getty Museum, wanting to buy the painting. The Getty was wonderful in creating an identity for me. There was a lot of tough talk and near misses, but the thieves fell for it.” Hill, who has died aged 73 after surgery to repair a torn aorta, refused point blank to go down the hatch. He had worked with the Metropolitan police’s art and antiques unit for six years, and knew that, while often romanticised, art thieves could be a dangerous bunch, wrapped up in organised crime. When hunting art, there was a serious risk, Hill told the BBC documentary The Billion Dollar Art Hunt (2020), that one could be “maimed or murdered”.  When the painting was brought up, the first thing the police officer did was to search its surface for the candle wax spilt by Munch when he painted the work in 1893. “In that particular version, the original version, he blew a candle out on it. I made a particular point of memorising exactly how those candle-wax drops looked.” The thieves in the Scream case, Hill said, were “local no-hopers”, who had merely climbed in through a window of the museum, yet high-level art theft is mostly the preserve of international gangs mixed up with the drugs and arms trade.    Hill recovered one version of Munch’s The Scream from a basement in a Norwegian fjord town. Photograph: AP   By the time he had travelled to Norway, his skills sought by the Norwegian government, Hill was well respected for his personable approach and a network of contacts that straddled the art world and the underworld. He had made his name in 1993, tracking down Lady Writing a Letter With Her Maid by Johannes Vermeer, stolen from Russborough House, an Irish stately home, seven years earlier. Shortly after the raid, the gangster Martin Cahill had demanded a multimillion-pound ransom for its return. Putting on an accent, and working on a tip-off, Hill posed as an art dealer who had Middle Eastern buyers lined up. “You’ve got to keep your lies to a minimum, but you’ve got to present yourself as somebody people want you to be,” Hill explained in 2018. “I’m as straight as I can be with people, but with a reasonable amount of charm.” The masquerade led him to a multi-storey car park in Antwerp. In the boot of a rented car, wrapped in rubbish sacks, was the Dutch baroque masterpiece. “I had to mask my emotions as I unwrapped the painting,” Hill said. “It’s the greatest masterpiece I’ve had the pleasure to hold.” Alongside it, unexpectedly, was Goya’s Portrait of Doña Antonia Zárate. Hill was born in Cambridge, the son of Zita (nee Tinling Widdrington), a ballerina, and Landon Hill, a captain in the US air force working on missile projects. The family moved between Britain, Germany and the US before settling in Washington DC. There, Charley attended the private St Albans school. He enlisted in the 1968 war draft, serving in Vietnam with the 173rd Airborne Brigade. On his return to civilian life, he enrolled at George Washington University in 1971 to study history, working nights as a museum security guard, before moving on a Fulbright scholarship to Trinity College Dublin. He taught at a Belfast school and was a youth worker until 1974, and then attended King’s College London, studying theology for two years on a veterans’ grant. He briefly considered ordination in the Church of England, but instead joined the Metropolitan police, first on the beat in Stamford Hill, then as a detective within the serious and organised crime squad. When he was made detective chief inspector in 1990, the art and antiques unit became one of his responsibilities.  In 1992, Hill recovered Christ and the Woman Taken in Adultery, a masterpiece of the Flemish school by Pieter Bruegel the Elder, valued at more than $1m, stolen from the Courtauld Gallery 10 years earlier. He also worked alongside the German police and Czech authorities to recover a $200,000 Lucas Cranach oil painting taken in a 1991 heist from the National Gallery in Prague.   I never give up. Those cases just remain open, until they’re solved      On leaving the force in 1997, he joined Nordstern Art Insurance (now Axa XL) in the City of London as a risk manager. In 2002 he returned to detective work, but in a private capacity. In his first year as a private eye, it became known that Hill was working with David Duddin, an art thief on parole, in his search for Titian’s Rest on the Flight into Egypt, stolen from the Marquess of Bath in 1995, and Jean-Baptiste Oudry’s The White Duck, taken in 1992 from the Marquess of Cholmondeley’s home in Norfolk, Houghton Hall. His acceptance that he might have to collaborate with crooks to recover art, often using rewards as bait, attracted criticism, but Hill claimed he was always “more interested in recovering the art than capturing the criminals”. At the time of his death, Hill was following a lead in the case of $500m worth of art stolen in 1990 from the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston. The FBI have long believed the 13 paintings, including works by Rembrandt, Degas and Manet, remain in the US, but Hill was convinced the haul lay sealed behind a wall in a house in west Dublin. His investigation was the subject of the erroneously titled The Billion Dollar Art Hunt, though Hill fell out with the producers, accusing them of putting the life of his source, the career criminal Martin Foley, at risk. “I never give up,” Hill said when asked if he had ever failed in his investigations. “Those cases just remain open, until they’re solved.” The Boston paintings are still at large. Hill is survived by his wife, Caroline (nee Stewart), whom he married in 1979, and their children, Susannah, Lizzie and Chris, and grandchildren, Georgia and Olivia.  • Charles Patrick Landon Hill, detective, born 22 May 1947; died 20 February 2021\\n',\n",

       "  'full_article': 'The parking lot was packed at The Shops at La Cantera, a partially outdoor mall in north-west San Antonio, on the day that Texas officially ended mandatory mask wearing. But it was clear not everyone was ready to embrace the change, with most people who wandered in and out of stores still donning face coverings, and many shops requiring customers to wear one before entering.   Related: Texans scramble to get vaccinated after Republican governor says no more masks   Governor Greg Abbott announced an end to the statewide mask mandate he issued over the summer on 2 March, and on Wednesday, the new rules took effect. This means that not only are Texans no longer required to wear a mask, but stores, restaurants, and even bars are fully open at maximum capacity despite the fact that only 16% of adults in the state are fully vaccinated. But a few businesses at the mall – including Macy’s, Victoria’s Secret, and L’Occitane en Provence – took it upon themselves to defy the new rules, posting signs informing customers that their policies are not in line with those of the state government. One reads: “Your mask must cover your nose and mouth at all times. No food or drink allowed.” Another says: “No mask, no entry. We welcome 4 customers inside at a time. Thank you!” Eryn Louis sat at a table in the outdoor food court across from her sister. Before agreeing to be interviewed, both women ask for a moment to put their face masks on – a clear indication of how they feel about the governor’s new order.    Mask policy of a shop in a San Antonio mall. Photograph: Erum Salam/The Guardian   “I absolutely hate it,” Louis said, referring to Abbott’s decision to end the statewide mask mandate. “I was at home with my mom when I found out about it. I almost wanted to cry because even though I’m double vaccinated, I’m still high risk since I’m type 1 diabetic. Our grandfather is high risk. My stepdad is high risk.” Louis and her sister said they had already witnessed a non-cooperative customer defy a store’s mask policy. “Today, when we were leaving Target there was a lady who was getting mad because Target is still requiring people to wear masks,” Louis said. “She said, ‘Target is not a Texas corporation. You don’t have to do this.’ And of course she wasn’t wearing a mask when she walked in.” Louis is both a student and a server in a restaurant. While she is completing her classes online, she must be physically present at work where she has been most at risk throughout the pandemic. “We used to [require masks]. Now our sign on the door just says we encourage them. Even last year, my managers cared more about the guest experience than they did about being mask police,” Louis said.  Louis said even before the mask mandate was lifted, she and other servers were told not to say anything to customers if they weren’t wearing a mask, since they would just take it off at their tables anyway. “I’ve had one customer come in who was a doctor. He was terrified of sitting by anyone because he’s seen Covid and what it could do.” Ayana Delvalle works at the cash register at the Pottery Barn, one of the many shops in the mall that is still enforcing a mask policy. “Pottery Barn’s policy from the beginning has always been to cover your nose and mouth from the moment you walk into the store until the time you leave,” Delvalle. “Even more so recently, we have incorporated no food or drink inside the store to prevent people from pulling their masks off.” Devalle says she is not yet vaccinated because she is still too nervous. “Getting the vaccination does scare me a little bit just because it’s still a little soon. I just want to wait it out and see how the more of the population reacts to it before I make that decision myself.”    Mask policy of a shop in a San Antonio mall. Photograph: Erum Salam/The Guardian   However, she says she will continue to wear a mask in public. “For me personally, it’s everyone’s choice but I would hope people would make the right decision as far as other people’s safety and health,” Devalle said. Mahak Ahsan is a student pharmacist in the city. She expressed frustration that the state government is impeding the work she and her colleagues are doing to administer vaccines, and educate people about the benefits of immunizations and wearing masks. “No one has any respect for the healthcare workers. Not even just for us but nurses and doctors – everyone who works so tirelessly. We’re the ones who are around the sick people the most so it’s just a slap in our face,” Ahsan said. “It just really sucks.” Ahsan believes the mask mandate lift is “a very bad idea”. “Majority of Texas hasn’t even been vaccinated. That’s insane,” Ahsan said. “I don’t feel comfortable knowing that so many people out here aren’t vaccinated and are walking around without masks.” Ahsan said she was angry and concerned because while she is fully vaccinated, her parents only just received their first shots this week. She believes vaccines should be available and accessible to everyone now that masks are no longer required. “They did a horrible job of trying to give the [vaccines] to the people who need it the most. You see these teachers still don’t have it,” she said. “At this point, it’s every man for himself. Everyone needs to have gotten it by now.”\\n',\n",

       "  'title': \"'Silence was crucial': Glasvegas's James Allan on soundtracking Return to Dunblane\",\n",
       "  'full_article': 'I was a teenager, walking through the art department at my school in the East End of Glasgow, when I heard the news about Dunblane. I never know how things affect me at the time they’re happening. I call myself emotionally slow, because it takes me time to be able to put a name on the emotions I’m feeling, or to realise how much something has shocked me. But I remember that moment – of the person telling me about a shooting at a primary school – so clearly, even now. It shouldn’t be hard to talk about how you’re feeling, but for some reason it is. That’s why I’m so impressed with the families in the new documentary Return to Dunblane with Lorraine Kelly. I don’t know how they were able to describe their experiences and emotions so well. One father recalls sitting down with a police officer and as soon as he heard him say “I’m sorry to tell you …”, he says everything transformed into a dream. I was asked to write the music for the documentary’s soundtrack. It was a difficult thing to compose for. Even if you soundtrack a movie based on a true story, it’s someone else’s version of the events. But this story was being told by the actual people involved. It’s extreme TV – extreme emotions, extreme everything. I’d written about tragedy before with my band Glasvegas. Flowers and Football Tops from our debut album is about a child who was murdered and how that might feel for the parents. I thought back to it when I was writing this music. It’s a familiar ground that you’re walking on. It reminded me to tread carefully with what I was doing. I had a Zoom call with Lorraine – who covered the tragedy at the time – to discuss the new documentary. She put me at ease straight away and was very welcoming – I think it’s these qualities that earned her the trust of the people she interviewed. The thing that struck me was when she was describing the press conference after the shooting happened. She said it was a room full of journalists, a place full of chaos. But when the police began reading out of the names of the children who died [16 children and a teacher lost their lives in the massacre] the room became silent. She said the sound of that silence stuck with her. Shortly after that conversation, I was sitting in the living room with my fiancee, Molly, and she had a glass of wine; she was playing with the wine glass on this wee flimsy table we had and the sounds were making it shake. It sounded like a tremble, a shiver, in the silence. I thought the soundtrack should be based around that. Writing the music was a new experience because, with Glasvegas, you can self destruct if you want – it’s up to you, because it’s your thing. But when you’re part of a much bigger thing you can’t do that. Your job is to move someone else’s story along. I’ve been obsessed with soundtracks since I was a kid – I was always more interested in them than the movies: Bill Conti’s Karate Kid soundtrack; Jack Nitzsche’s music for Stand By Me; and then the one that really blew my mind was Philadelphia by Howard Shore. People think you can take the music this way or that way, but I think they underestimate how often the music leads you. I’ve tried before to influence things but the music will say “no, this is the way we’re going” and that’s how it was with this. Once I have the start of a melody, I can’t stop thinking about it until it’s resolved. Sometimes, the melodies never resolve, but the best ones always do. Until they do, it’s like you’re going mad – I think about them when I’m trying to sleep or talking to somebody. But that’s just artists I guess. We’re a wee bit mad. With Glasvegas, people are just waiting until I’m happy, then they say “quick, record it before he changes his mind!” But with this I needed someone else’s approval, which was a new experience. The feedback for my first composition was: “Can you make it more dramatic?” I didn’t really know what that meant, so I took it as licence to really push things. I sent back another version on the night of the deadline and was told “This is too dramatic”. But we got there, eventually. I’d definitely like to pursue doing more soundtrack work. Other people are better at describing how they feel, but perhaps that’s why they don’t need to make music. Now that I think about it, maybe this is how I express my emotions best. James Allan was speaking to Tim Jonze. Return to Dunblane with Lorraine Kelly airs at 9pm on 11 March on ITV.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'Myanmar: Aung San Suu Kyi accused of taking bribes as more deaths reported',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'The United Nations has condemned the Myanmar military’s violent crackdown against anti-coup demonstrators as eight more people were reported shot dead in protests and a military spokesman accused deposed leader Aung San Suu Kyi of taking bribes. Speaking in the capital of Naypyidaw on Thursday, a junta spokesman, Zaw Min Tun, alleged the detained chief minister of Yangon admitted giving Aung San Suu Kyi $600,000 in cash, along with more than 11kg ($680,000 worth) of gold. The anti-corruption commission was investigating, Zaw Min Tun said. The claims were strongly rejected by members of her National League for Democracy, one of whom, former MP Aye Ma Ma Myo, told Reuters: “It is no longer uncommon to see slander against politicians and efforts to crush the party while innocent young people are killed in public.” Aung San Suu Kyi, detained since the coup, faces other criminal charges including owning unlicensed walkie-talkies and violating coronavirus restrictions by staging a campaign event in 2020.   Related: Myanmar police surround protesters and raid compound in Yangon   The new charges came as the military’s crackdown on protests opposing the coup continued. Local media, witnesses and medics said six people were shot dead in the central town of Myaing on Thursday when security forces opened fire on anti-junta protests and domestic media said one man was killed in the North Dagon district of Yangon, Myanmar’s biggest city. Photographs posted on Facebook showed a man lying prone on the street, bleeding from a head wound. A further death was reported in Mandalay. More than 60 people are believed to have been killed protesting against the 1 February coup that removed Aung San Suu Kyi’s elected government from power. The UN statement criticising the crackdown however removed language that explicitly condemned the coup and threatened possible further action from the British-drafted text, due to opposition by China, Russia, India and Vietnam. The presidential statement, signed by all 15 members of the security council called for “utmost restraint” by the military. A presidential statement is a step below a resolution but becomes part of the official record of the UN’s most powerful body. The statement called for the immediate release of government leaders including state counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi and president Win Myint who have been detained since they were ousted in the coup. It said it supported the country’s democratic transition and “stresses the need to uphold democratic institutions and processes, refrain from violence, fully respect human rights and fundamental freedoms and uphold the rule of law”. But it is weaker than the initial draft circulated by the United Kingdom which would have condemned the military coup itself and threatened “possible measures under the UN Charter” – UN language for sanctions – “should the situation deteriorate further.” Diplomats said council members China, Russia, India and Vietnam, which is a member of the 10-nations Association of Southeast Asian Nations known as Asean, along with Myanmar, objected to provisions in stronger earlier drafts of the statement. China’s UN Ambassador Zhang Jun said in a statement that “it is important the council members speak in one voice,” and declared that it’s now time for de-escalation, diplomacy and dialogue. The UN statement came as Amnesty International accused Myanmar security forces of using battlefield weapons on unarmed protesters and carrying out premeditated killings orchestrated by their commanding officers. International pressure on the Myanmar junta has mounted since the army ousted and detained civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi last month, triggering daily protests around the country. The United States also applied fresh pressure with sanctions against Aung Pyae Sone and Khin Thiri Thet Mon, two adult children of Myanmar junta leader Min Aung Hlaing. The pair have a variety of business holdings that have directly benefited from their “father’s position and malign influence”, said a US Treasury statement. The UK is also exploring fresh sanctions, foreign minister Dominic Raab said in a tweet.  Welcome news from @SecBlinken of further sanctions targeting the Myanmar Commander-in-Chief’s family and business interests. The UK is exploring additional sanctions too – we are clear the regime should not be allowed to profit from abuse of power and human rights violations.— Dominic Raab (@DominicRaab) March 10, 2021  Close to 2,000 people have been arrested and the death toll has climbed to more than 60 in a post-coup crackdown. On Wednesday, police surrounded and arrested at least 200 students and civilians protesting against the military coup on the outskirts of Yangon, according to witnesses who said those detained were driven away in unmarked trucks. Video footage from North Okkalapa showed protesters fleeing under fire. At least one person appeared to be seriously wounded. “Some of them were severely beaten, but the people are still continuing their protest,” a local rescue worker told AFP. Footage showed people coughing and washing their faces after teargas was deployed and there were reports of gunfire. “A girl was wounded in her pelvic area by gunshot and she was taken to her home because the hospital is occupied by the security forces,” a rescue worker said. Earlier, military forces raided a compound in a Yangon neighbourhood that is home to state railway workers who have been on strike. Riot police sealed off the Mingalar Taung Nyunt area where the Ma Hlwa Kone train station and housing for rail employees are located.    Anti-coup protesters with makeshift shields in Mandalay. Photograph: AP   Thousands of government workers across the country have been participating in a civil disobedience movement aimed at choking state institutions and paralysing the economy. The movement has resulted in hospital disruptions, bank closures and empty ministry offices. Amnesty International meanwhile, has collated graphic video clips posted on social media to document what it called a “nationwide killing spree” in the weeks since the military seized power on 1 February. “These Myanmar military tactics are far from new, but their killing sprees have never before been livestreamed for the world to see,” Joanne Mariner, Amnesty’s director of crisis response, said in a new report. “These are not the actions of overwhelmed, individual officers making poor decisions,” she said. “These are unrepentant commanders already implicated in crimes against humanity, deploying their troops and murderous methods in the open.” Amnesty analysed 55 videos recorded from 28 February to 8 March in cities across Myanmar, including Mandalay and Yangon. In one Facebook clip, dated 28 February from the south-eastern city of Dawei, a soldier was seen handing his rifle to a police officer next to him. The policeman takes aim and shoots, before personnel around them erupt in apparent celebration. The footage was recorded from a property above the street. In the background of the audio, women can be heard sobbing. “Not only does this incident show a reckless disregard for human life, making sport of shooting live rounds at protesters, it also reveals deliberate coordination among security forces,” Mariner said. Amnesty said some military units had been drafted in from restive ethnic-minority areas of Myanmar where many atrocities are said to have occurred, and also alleged extrajudicial executions of protesters.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'Natural England gives proposed London Resort site protected status',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Marshes, pasture and reedbeds beside the Thames where developers want to build a theme park have been listed as a site of special scientific interest (SSSI) in recognition of its rare and diverse insect life. The decision by Natural England to recognise the national importance of Swanscombe peninsula, which is home to 1,991 species of invertebrates, more than any known site in the country, was welcomed by campaigners hoping to save the partly brownfield site from the £3.5bn London Resort. Giving SSSI status to the wetlands and former concrete works, one of only two locations where the distinguished jumping spider is found, would normally protect the area from development. But the government has deemed the proposed theme park to be a “nationally significant infrastructure project” – a classification normally reserved for major roads or airports – which means environmental factors can be overridden during the planning process. Matt Shardlow, the chief executive of Buglife, thanked Natural England “for doing the right thing by protecting one of the country’s most important wildlife sites” but added: “The Swanscombe peninsula remains under threat and it is crucial that a precedent isn’t set by allowing a fun fair to be considered as more important than the wildlife that inspires wonder and sustains us.” Buglife, the RSPB and Kent Wildlife Trust called on Natural England “to do everything in its power” to ensure that the newly proposed SSSI is protected and the government is made fully aware of the “exceptional value” of Swanscombe peninsula and the wider ecology of the Thames estuary. James Seymour, the Sussex and Kent area manager for Natural England, said: “The designation of Swanscombe peninsula as an SSSI is great news for one of the richest known sites in England for invertebrates, ensuring essential refuge for many rare and threatened species that sadly are not able to thrive in the wider landscape. “Right on the doorstep of some of our most densely populated towns and cities, this new SSSI will also offer wonderful opportunities for people to connect with nature via the England coast path. This area is living proof that some of our most important species can thrive hand in hand with businesses and transport infrastructure. Special places like this will form the vital backbone of a national nature recovery network.” Natural England said it was aware of the “potential development opportunities” around Swanscombe and the SSSI designation for 250 hectares of the peninsula was an important step in ensuring its environmental value was “taken due account of” in any future planning decisions. PY Gerbeau, chief executive of London Resort Company Holdings, said: “The project will of course continue, and this is just another issue to address in the long history of this project.” He added: “Sustainability is a green thread throughout the London Resort proposals and we’re very proud of that. We have demonstrated, across thousands of pages within our application, our vision to deliver a net gain in biodiversity and our commitment to enhancing and managing habitats. An investment that runs into millions because we believe in sustainability and in our role as custodians of the environment. “We have shown how we plan to transform a contaminated, former industrial site, through this exceptional, once in a lifetime opportunity. An opportunity which will bring thousands of jobs, generate substantial economic growth and boost tourism with the UK’s first, world class theme park resort.”\\n',\n",

       "  'title': \"'I'm isolated': Joel Corry on bodybuilding, reality TV and his sacrifices to reach No 1\",\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Amid the draining gloom of pandemic life, Joel Corry has been a soothing constant: if you have turned on the radio at any time in the past year, there is a huge chance that one of the British pop-house producer’s three big singles will have been playing. Sorry, Lonely and Head & Heart (the latter a six-week chart topper) have collectively earned more than a billion streams and made Corry into one of the UK’s biggest new pop stars, a Calvin Harris type who has guest vocalists out front while he prods equipment and points gunfingers skyward. Sorry got a boost from being used on Love Island in 2018, and his music is rather like the Love Island of pop: buoyant, cheesy, suffused with romantic drama and sparkling sunlight. But when talking to him in his hotel room, clouds gather. Corry could actually be a Love Island contestant: he has the good looks and earnest kindly nature of a 90s boyband heartthrob, as well as the abdominals, which look not so much chiselled as 3D-printed following a successful earlier career as a bodybuilder. In fact, he has reality TV pedigree as a rare southern interloper amid the cast of MTV’s lairy Geordie Shore; he was the boyfriend of the show’s charismatic bad-influencer Sophie Kasaei, with whom he had a six-year relationship until 2017.    His TV-ready teeth beam out of his webcam in Dubai, where he spent the early weeks of the year following a presumably lucrative New Year’s Eve DJ set, at – he stresses – a socially distanced, masked and seated venue in the city. Kasaei and her peers were criticised for travelling to Dubai mid-pandemic to pose in swimwear on their socials, but Corry says he has kept his head down: “Looking like you’re living it up … while everyone back at home is just having such a horrible time of it – that doesn’t sit right with me.” He has since returned to the UK, and while his reasoning for going out in the first place hardly seems essential business – he wanted to, after the pandemic cancelled a year of DJing – he says that aside from some rooftop exercise classes he filmed, he stayed put in his hotel room, recorded his weekly Kiss FM show and tinkered with new tracks. This workaholism has been with him his whole life, says Corry: “It’s a gift and a curse. I’m pretty isolated. I know it looks like I’ve got a lot going on, but the truth is, I have one really good friend, my mum, my sister and my brother. And there’s no one else in that circle.” Inspired by his DJ older brother, he started out as a teenage UK garage fan in Barnet, north London, originally calling himself DJ Jenga. He cringes, his face creasing at the memory: “My brother had this line about me: all the DJs are falling down but Jenga’s still rising! I thought I was so cool. Garage, and grime: it’s my roots. I grew up in a period where I felt I was part of something.” He and a friend started a DJ business, playing discos and birthday parties in north London, and Corry graduated to residencies at the capital’s clubs. “It was a hustle, turning up and asking the DJ if you could do their warmup set,” he says. He studied music production at college, then the music business at university; while his fellow freshers were out strawpedoing alcopops, he was providing the soundtrack. “I’ve DJed to commercial dancefloors – sometimes six or seven nights a week – since I was 16, and I’m 32 now. DJing is the love of my life; it’s electricity, adrenaline, joy. And when it comes to production and creating my music, I now know the moments the crowd need to have: the drops, the singalong moments, the hooks.”    Sophie Kasaei and Joel Corry in 2013. Photograph: WENN Rights Ltd/Alamy   A side hustle was working as a runner at MTV while DJing at the weekends in Mayfair, where he could get the Geordie Shore cast on to guestlists. Soon he was dating Kasaei and became a TV star in his own right. “Twitter and Instagram had just exploded; it was brutal at points,” he says. “I was able to get a bit of a thick skin to the bad comments and nasty stuff, but it was difficult to see [Kasaei] going through that. It made us closer as well; we were a team, getting through.” He says he has generally good memories of the show, though, and his raised profile took his DJing nationwide and to European party resorts such as Malia and Zante each summer. I can almost hear him shouting out the drinks promos on the mic between tracks. “Maybe they weren’t the most credible gigs,” he admits. “I was playing a lot of crap venues. I’ve played in every town in the UK, and I played to so many empty clubs. But my name was still on the flyer, you know? I just felt like, whatever I do, get my name out there. The TV thing was another platform for me to push myself.”   I had to be on my own. And I still feel like that now. It’s almost selfish, but I can’t have any distractions, man  Joel Corry    So too was the bodybuilding: he won competitions, earned sponsorship deals and got the bodybuilding equivalent of a No 1 single: the cover of Muscle & Fitness magazine, his torso straining like a mixed grill through a fishing net. He first hit the gym back in his school days, idolising Arnie and Sly and in search of a six pack to impress girls, “then the competitive side of me wanted to see how far I could push it”. Getting the ultra-lean physique to be best in show in his bodybuilding career was also difficult, and required some damaging behaviour. “Definitely at points it was unbalanced. There were no darker nights than the ones when I was in bed starving, wanting to have food but I didn’t because I was on the diet plan.    ‘Exercise was a way of channelling whatever was going on in my head’ ... Joel Corry. Photograph: Benjamin Hennig/PR   “I wouldn’t say doing those competitions is healthy,” he continues. “I wouldn’t recommend them. That’s got to come from a burning desire in the individual, wanting to push themselves to another level.” His physique has settled from hypertrophied to merely very jacked. “Every morning when I go on the treadmill or do weights, everything in my brain is firing for my to-do list that day; that’s what I get out of it now.” Buffeted by body image expectations on one side and his own drive on the other, Corry seems to have walked a tightrope towards a healthier state of fitness, to the point where he is now satirising the quests for bodily perfection and social media clout in his Black Mirror-ish music videos. But he still seems prone to the same obsessive behaviour that once spurred him to compete. As a teenager, “I felt like I had to make myself look like that to, kind of like ...” He grasps: “Be me. Exercise, even to an obsessional level, was a way of channelling whatever was going on in my head, controlling anxieties. As I’ve got older, I’m able to channel the obsessive stuff into my music career.” He says this brutal single-mindedness pushed him to break up with Kasaei. “My ambitions of what I wanted to do, and things I wanted to achieve, I had to be on my own. And I still feel like that’s the way now. It’s almost selfish, but I can’t have any distractions, man. My mum is like: ‘Joel, one day you need to get married!’ But right now, I can’t see it. I focused 100% of my time and my love into making it in the music industry, and it eventually happened.” Beginning in 2015, he released 12 singles in a row that didn’t reach the Top 100, but after putting his focus entirely on music, he forged industry connections and partnerships to the point he is now constantly courted by songwriters keen for him to add his production. He says he prefers working in person with them in his studio space in King’s Cross, London, creating tracks “organically made from the ground up, from having a loop on or some chords. Early demos of some of these tracks are someone just humming.”    His subsequent back-to-back hits are now joined by new single Bed, a collaboration with the pop singer Raye and dance titan David Guetta that is currently rising through the charts. Where Head & Heart was addictively catchy, vocalist MNEK evoking a fluttering heart in the phonetic chorus, Bed is no less of an earworm, but softer, with gorgeous cosmic-disco detailing and what is becoming Corry’s signature flourish: a climactic drop that lands with devastating sweetness on the offbeat. He will next try to add a hit album to his singles; if he achieves that, will he finally be happy? “I’m never satisfied,” he says, his voice a blend of athletic will and wry, exasperated guilt. “It’s not a money thing; it’s more a validation thing. Even after I had Head & Heart [at No 1], I was saying: what’s next? I almost find it hard to enjoy the moments. Whatever this is inside me, I’m so happy I’ve got it because it drives me, but it means I will never stop. I’m always in my own head, and the thoughts of what I’m going to do next – it’s constant.” No pain, no gain, as he has no doubt frequently scolded himself. • Bed is out now on Perfect Havoc / Asylum\\n',\n",

       "  'title': \"The Good Girls by Sonia Faleiro review – the story of an 'ordinary killing'\",\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Two teenage girls go missing. They are discovered hanging from a mango tree. Sexual activity may or may not have taken place, prior to their deaths. Were they killed or did they kill themselves? There are eyewitnesses who may be the aggressors – their stories don’t match up. To add to this, there is a defining visual image. The dead bodies hang from the tree for days, knocking against each other in repetitive, heart-breaking camaraderie, while the grieving women of the village form a circle around the tree trunk, to prevent the girls from being taken down. If they come down, Padma and Lalli (not their real names) will be forgotten. As long as the corpses retain the power to horrify, they are protected from indifference. “Place is the crossroads of circumstance,” Eudora Welty wrote in her 1957 essay “Place in Fiction” – “the proving ground of, what happened? Who’s here? Who’s coming?” In the The Good Girls, the shifting answers to these questions form a morass of half-truths and lies, freighting the ancient fields of Katra Sadatganj – an “eyeblink of a village” in Uttar Pradesh, north India – with existential threat. This ancestral land, a marker of power and identity for those who work in it, “put dal in the katori, clothes on the back … It made them cultivators. Without it they were landless labourers”. Those who inhabit it “believed they would sense if something was amiss, just as one can sense a change in the texture of one’s palm. But this was not the case.” What follows, in this shocking, mesmerising book by Sonia Faleiro, is an unravelling of shared hubris.   Related: India’s caste system is alive and kicking – and maiming and killing | Mari Marcel Thekaekara   Faleiro uses the structures of a true crime narrative. The need in the reader to understand these painfully premature deaths and make sense of the world, means that the real objective of The Good Girls – to turn and face the factual horror of inequality – is skilfully masked. “Journalists justify their treachery in various ways according to their temperaments,” was the verdict of Janet Malcolm in The Journalist and the Murderer (1989); “The more pompous talk about freedom of speech and ‘the public’s right to know’; the least talented talk about Art.” In this sense, Faleiro is a judicious writer: as with her nonfiction debut Beautiful Thing – a portrait of the table dancers of Bombay – the prose in The Good Girls is full of precise intention. Facts are presented without the electric burn of outrage. The reader plays detective as the story unfolds, piecing together “evidence” that is remembered from earlier chapters – a phone call, a text, a snatch of overheard conversation, an admission that might later be denied. The author will not hold your hand as you navigate this mystery; instead you are encouraged to solve it yourself. At the heart of the book, and crucial to interpretation of events, is the question of consent – more specifically, of consensual desire. Padma and Lalli are referred to repeatedly by relatives and politicians as family assets – tangible, walking, breathing manifestations of family honour. There are multiple discussions as to whether they have been raped – at one point the media reports declare this to be incontrovertible, and yet the evidence does not support it beyond reasonable doubt. Vital evidence is tampered with, in the name of saving family honour: phone recordings are deleted, witnesses are told to revise their stories, and the number of potential rapists swells from one to five and back again. The idea that the girls might have had their own romantic lives with boys from the village is crushed in the white noise of gossip and misinformation. Faleiro’s subjects are numerous and interconnected – from India’s corrupt politicians and media to the deleterious effects of caste prejudice and the systemic rot scouring its way through the police force. But her core subject is that of entrapment, and she returns again and again to the lack of agency that the girls have over their own lives, banned as they are from wandering freely around the village and its environs. The author concludes that “an Indian woman’s first challenge was surviving her own home”. The girls’ nightly journey to squat in the fields after dinner to relieve themselves emerges as the only gap in a system set up to put them under constant surveillance. And it is this gap of possibility, at Welty’s “crossroads of circumstance” that Padma and Lalli enter flushed with life, only to die hours later. The Good Girls is a beautifully calibrated book, full of suspense to the final pages, urging us to walk into that night and listen. • You People by Nikita Lalwani is published by Viking.

       "  'title': 'Boris Johnson resists calls to correct claim in NHS pay row',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Boris Johnson has resisted calls from Labour to apologise and correct what the party said was a false claim about opposition MPs voting against a pay rise for nurses. The prime minister’s press secretary, Allegra Stratton, insisted he said nothing wrong, after the Commons Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, piled pressure on by saying that not admitting mistakes was “dishonourable”. The row began when Johnson was challenged by the Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, over the government recommending a 1% pay rise for some NHS staff, despite their hard work during the coronavirus pandemic. Holding up a copy of the NHS long-term plan published in June 2019, Starmer said: “Two years ago, he made a promise to the NHS in black and white: his document commits to a minimum pay rise of 2.1%.” Johnson retorted that Starmer “voted against the document in question”, prompting outrage from Labour MPs and a complaint from the shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth – because no one voted against the NHS Funding Act, which brought the 2.1% pay rise into effect. At the time, Hoyle said that by making his intervention, Ashworth had achieved his aim of putting a clarification on the record.     However, amid rising anger from opposition MPs, Hoyle issued a new statement saying the onus was on MPs to “correct the record if they make an inaccurate statement to the house”. He cited the ministerial code, which says MPs should “correct any inadvertent error at the earliest opportunity”. And in a thinly veiled warning to Johnson, Hoyle said ministers “must take responsibility for correcting the record if a mistake has been made”. He added: “It is not dishonourable to make a mistake, but to seek to avoid admitting one is a different matter.” Stratton later said Johnson had nothing to apologise for and would not make new comments on the subject in parliament, because the prime minister had been talking about the Queen’s speech, which sets out the government’s upcoming plans to create new laws. There was no mention of the speech during Johnson and Starmer’s exchange, but Stratton said the “document in question” that the prime minister referred to was the Queen’s speech. She denied the government was trying to retroactively find an explanation for Johnson’s comments, telling reporters at the daily lobby briefing of journalists: “It’s not hindsight, it’s explaining what was said yesterday. We’ve gone over this to establish the grounds upon which he made a point.” On Wednesday, Stratton made no mention of the Queen’s speech in her explanation of Johnson’s comments, but on Thursday explained that was because “I hadn’t had a chance to speak to the PM … I hadn’t been able to get to the bottom of the particular point he’d been making”. Asked if Johnson felt he needed to make the explanation himself in parliament, she said: “No, he does not.” Starmer, when asked about the matter at Labour’s local election campaign launch, said Johnson should apologise and correct the record. “I’m afraid we have a prime minister who has never taken responsibility for anything in his life, and he should start now,” he said. Jacob Rees-Mogg, leader of the Commons, explained the meaning behind Johnson’s comments in a short statement on Thursday, but Labour pushed for the prime minister to do so himself. In his second letter to Johnson on the subject, Ashworth said: “I believe it is in the public interest that you clarify the situation yourself through a statement to parliament to abide by the [ministerial] code.”\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'Shell chief took more than 40% pay cut in 2020 as Covid hit profits ',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Royal Dutch Shell cut the pay of its chief executive by more than 40% in 2020 after the oil company plunged to a $20bn (£14.3bn) loss triggered by the steepest ever drop in oil demand during the Covid-19 pandemic. Ben van Beurden’s total remuneration fell to €5.8m (£5m) last year, compared with about €10m the year before. It is the second consecutive pay cut for the chief executive after his pay packet halved in 2019.   Related: ECB to speed up pandemic bond-buying stimulus programme – business live   Van Beurden was also forced to cut Shell’s dividend for the first time since the second world war, and will make staff cuts of 7,000 to 9,000 across the group’s global business as the oil and gas company grapples with the financial toll of the pandemic and the pressure to adapt to a low-carbon energy future. Shell also announced on Thursday that its chairman, Chad Holliday, would step down after six years in the role, to be succeeded by the former BHP chief executive Andrew Mackenzie from May. Mackenzie’s six-year tenure at BHP Billiton was defined by an ambitious turnaround programme in which the Anglo-Australian company streamlined its operations and shrugged off its interests in US shale drilling. Mackenzie said it was “a pivotal time for the industry and wider society” and he planned to “profitably accelerate Shell’s transition into a net zero emissions energy business” that would “continue to generate substantial value for shareholders, customers and communities alike”. The Scottish-born geologist spent 22 years at BP before moving to the mining company Rio Tinto and then BHP. He joined the Shell board in October. Van Beurden said he was looking forward to working with Mackenzie. “We are emerging from the Covid-19 pandemic with a clear and distinct strategy that I believe will enable us to seize the opportunities presented by the energy transition. I cannot think of anyone better than Andrew to take this role,” he said. The pandemic caused a precipitous fall in oil prices in March 2020 as traders adjusted to the prospect of far lower demand for transport fuels and a deep global recession. Shell responded by slashing its spending, lowering its oil price forecasts for the coming years, and writing down the value of its oil and gas assets by $22bn.   Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk   Van Beurden’s fixed pay was worth €2.1m, and he declined to take an annual bonus for 2020 as the value of shares slumped. However, he still received a bonus of €3.7m under his long-term incentive plan, down from €8m in 2019. Shell’s chief financial officer, Jessica Uhl, received pay of €3.7m, including a long-term bonus of €2m. Oil prices have recovered in the early months of 2021, in part because of dramatic production cuts but also because of hopes for the global economic recovery as Covid vaccination programmes roll out. Brent crude oil futures were sold for more than $65 a barrel on Thursday, above the $63 levels at the start of 2020, before the extent of the pandemic’s impact on the global economy became clear. The improvement in oil prices has lifted the price of Shell’s shares, though they remain 31% below their levels at the start of 2020.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'England must learn lessons from India tour but future still looks bright | Ebony Rainford-Brent',\n",
       "  'full_article': \"Amid all the despair about England’s heavy defeat in the Test series in India, it is important to keep some perspective: before the tour started almost everyone I spoke to was predicting a 4-0 defeat and, though it was in the end only a little less one-sided than that, Joe Root’s side avoided a whitewash and managed to pull off one of their best away results in recent years. India’s record at home is incredible and they came into the series full of confidence after winning in Australia; England had an inexperienced batting lineup, particularly against spin, and badly needed a top-level, ready-to-go second spinner. The series threw up plenty of issues for them, areas they have to work on if they want to move towards being the best in the world, but I don’t think the result was surprising. When you put it in perspective, it was probably about par.   Related: England's treatment of Jonny Bairstow has continued his cycle of pain and joy | Jonathan Liew   Ravichandran Ashwin, India’s wonderful 34-year-old spinner, was the man of the series but the players who stood out for me were their youngsters, which is a theme that continued from Australia. Washington Sundar, only 21, had played one Test before but averaged 90.50 in his three appearances and took a couple of wickets; the 23-year-old Rishabh Pant kept wicket well and batted excellently; Axar Patel, 27, played the first three Tests of his career and took 27 wickets at an average of 10.59. These are players who have been brought up in the IPL, which is a different type of cricket but means they are bred to handle pressure, so these moments don’t faze them. This is the culture of Indian cricket and I think it could help them dominate the sport for a while. They have a very balanced side: in the past they didn’t always have the seam bowlers, but now they’ve got Jasprit Bumrah, and when he couldn’t play Mohammed Siraj came in and was outstanding. Then there’s Virat Kohli: they won the series in Australia despite having their captain for only one game and against England he batted poorly, averaging 28.66, but once again they showed they don’t rely on him. This is a great India squad full of options, high on confidence, and they were playing in ideal conditions. Losing to them in India is no disgrace, and no surprise.    Virat Kohli, Axar Patel, Rishabh Pant and Mohammed Siraj (left to right) hold the series trophy. Photograph: Amit Dave/Reuters   There was lots of controversy about the state of the pitches. I don’t think many people, even in India, would disagree that the third Test, which finished in two days, was played on a poor wicket – India made full use of home advantage with that one and took it to an extreme. Overall, though, I don’t think the pitches were a factor in winning or losing the series, particularly given England won three of the four tosses. Only once did England take advantage of that good fortune, when a double century from Joe Root and good innings from Dom Sibley and Ben Stokes put them in control of the opening Test. On a flat wicket they were OK but as soon as it started to spin the lack of options was obvious. Players were repeatedly getting out bowled or lbw to balls that went straight, they weren’t getting their bat out in front, and they were getting stuck in the danger zone rather than getting really forward or getting really back. Under extreme pressure an inexperienced lineup repeatedly crumbled.   Sometimes we do focus on specific tours rather than the bigger picture   The top order struggled horribly. In eight innings England’s opening partnership posted more than 10 runs only twice and only once did they get as many as 20. Other than the first innings of the series, the opening partnership lasted, on average, 18.6 deliveries, while across the entire series the second wicket lasted 25.4. This meant Root, batting at No 4, was coming in far too early: without a platform, he had an unbearable amount of pressure as he tried to make up for the deficiencies around him. Over the last 18 months or so England have been able to get early runs, but in spinning conditions that did not happen. As a result there is once again doubt about the best lineup, and players who feel they are on the verge of getting dropped will struggle to show their best. England always have a packed diary, but when push comes to shove there are only two tours – India and Australia – where careers get made. If you can perform there, in the toughest conditions for different reasons, on wickets ideal either for spin or for bounce and seam, you’ve made your name. But sometimes we do focus on specific tours rather than the bigger picture, on results in extreme conditions that we have to face only infrequently.   Related: Sam Curran's convoluted diary shows England have lost control of players | Ali Martin   It will be interesting now to see how England bounce back in the summer, when there are two Tests against New Zealand and then five against India at home, probably with a few green-topped seaming pitches literally to swing things in their favour a little. If they can park this series just gone, realise they won’t have to face this kind of challenge again for a while, get their batters firing again, help Jack Leach, their frontline spinner and the one English player who improved through the series, as he continues to develop, and refocus on the Test journey ahead, there is still a bright future there for the taking.   Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors’ picks.  Now is the time to plan for the next cycle – start, for example, by looking after the seam bowlers, particularly Jofra Archer with his troublesome elbow and the overworked Ben Stokes, because come the Ashes next winter they are going to be vital and their workloads between now and then will have to be very carefully managed. The India series ended with a run of emphatic defeats and individual disappointments but playing these opponents in these conditions is probably the hardest of all cricketing arts to master. England should learn everything they can from this series and then draw a line under it.\\n\",\n",

       "  'title': \"Cherry review – taking the 'post' out of post-traumatic stress disorder\",\n",
       "  'full_article': \"The Russo brothers, Anthony and Joe, have become renowned for directing the epics of the Marvel Cinematic Universe; and now they take on the big, serious, operatically painful story of Cherry, about a US army medic played by Tom Holland who leaves the service in 2007 with PTSD after witnessing horrors in Iraq. He acquires an opioid addiction that blossoms into a full-scale smack habit, miserably shared with his young wife Emily (Ciara Bravo), and finally finds a new trade in robbing banks, like a zombie wired on desperation. The Russos produce and direct, and screenwriters Angela Russo-Otstot and Jessica Goldberg have adapted the bestselling autobiographical novel by the decorated war veteran and ex-convict Nico Walker about his own desolate experiences in Civvy Street, robbing banks to feed his habit.   Related: Marvel directors the Russo brothers: 'The Avengers films were a powerful political tool, at the right time'    Holland is a fierce, compact presence, his jaw muscles perennially working: he is a sweetly innocent young guy who falls for fellow college student Emily and one afternoon makes a fatally premature decision to tell her he loves her. Instead of hearing “I love you” back, Emily is scared by the gesture, pulls away from him and in angry despair at what turns out to be a temporary break-up Cherry irreversibly signs on the dotted line to join the army. Everything follows from that.    The movie is divided into self-consciously weighty and epic chapters, but really it splits into two parts, war and postwar: Cherry’s military career in Iraq, in which he is both brutalised and brutalising, and then the grim nightmare of his civilian life which makes it clear that the “post” in post-traumatic stress disorder is wrong. His is a life of continuing trauma, continuing stress and continuing disorder. This is a vehement, heartfelt film that culminates in a colossally grandiose sequence with a full-scale overhead camera shot (the sort mocked in Team America: World Police) and Puccini blaring on the soundtrack. Holland certainly brings his A-game. At various times, he reminded me of Jake Gyllenhaal as the stoic grunt in Sam Mendes’s Jarhead and the smack addict Heath Ledger in Neil Armfield’s underrated heroin drama Candy. But Emily’s story is skated over and the film is rounded off a little too easily into a straightforward redemption story (its mood tacitly absorbing the happy ending of the publishing and movie deals) with no permanent price paid. There is the bleakest kind of chaotic humour in the bank robberies themselves – and it’s a reminder that apart from the Avengers movies, the Russo brothers also directed episodes of the TV comedy Arrested Development. Jack Reynor has a great supporting role as the loathsome drug dealer nicknamed Pills’n’Coke, familiarly known as “Pills”, who becomes Cherry’s longterm supplier and even his sort-of friend, although friendships are impossible in the soulless world of drug addiction. Pills finds himself being roped into being a getaway driver and then bank robber himself alongside Cherry, with terrible consequences which show us just how much Pills is really esteemed by his new non-friends. What is very interesting about the robberies here is that they show that in the moment-by-moment confrontation with the bank teller, there is a kind of negotiation, or bargaining. The teller might decide to offer a single wad of cash, but the gun-brandishing robber might angrily demand another wad before making a run for it – and all the time the clock is running down; the robber fears the police arriving and the teller fears being shot. It is a game of chicken in which the robber always loses in the end. Cherry is a fervent movie, corn-fed with drama and action, but maybe a little less than the sum of its parts. • Cherry is released on 12 March on Apple TV+.\\n\",\n",

The 47-year-old was stopped last month near his home in Windermere, Florida, after reports he was driving erratically, hit a curb and drove past a stop sign line.

       "  'title': \"If Johnson thinks he can charm his way to success at Cop26, he's sorely mistaken | Larry Elliott\",\n",
       "  'full_article': 'It ought to be simple, but it will be anything but. When almost 200 countries gather for the UN Cop26 climate conference in Glasgow in November, they will do so under the shadow of two crises: a global pandemic that emerged out of nowhere and a climate emergency that nearly everybody has been able to see coming. Governments have spent trillions of pounds, dollars and euros in the battle against Covid-19. They have the incentive – as Boris Johnson puts it – to build back better, to channel that stimulus into the greening of the global economy. If ever there was a time to think big and be bold then this is it. Six years ago, the nations that will gather in Scotland later this year met in Paris, where they pledged to halt the increase in global temperatures and so avoid the worst impacts of climate breakdown. But most of the big emitters are not even meeting the modest commitments made in 2015, and the mercury continues to rise. In Glasgow, countries need to set more testing targets and lay out in detail how they intend to meet them. There’s no question about it: the Cop26 is both the biggest and the most important summit Britain has ever hosted. Yet there is no guarantee that the conference will end in success, and warning signs abound that it might end in failure. That, as John Kerry noted earlier this week, would be a disaster. Joe Biden’s climate envoy wants Glasgow to kickstart a decade of action. “This is the moment,” Kerry has said. The fact that Biden reinstated the US to the Paris agreement within hours of being sworn in as president is one piece of good news in recent months. Washington plans to announce new carbon-reduction pledges shortly, something that would certainly not be happening had Donald Trump been re-elected. American engagement with the process at least makes it possible for Cop26 to end well. Kerry wants the US and the EU to put joint pressure on China, India and Brazil, to make firmer commitments to emissions reduction. Achieving this will not be easy. The reason there has not been a successfully completed round of global trade talks is that the US and the European Union make up a smaller proportion of the global economy than they did in the decades after the second world war. The leading emerging-market countries are no longer willing to sign up to deals cooked up between Washington and Brussels. Relations between the UK and China are at a low ebb, and Beijing doesn’t seem eager to make life easier for Boris Johnson in the run-up to Glasgow. China is responsible for more than a quarter of CO2 emissions, and burns more coal than every other nation on Earth combined. President Xi Jinping has set a target for becoming a net-zero emissions country by 2060, but when the latest five-year plan was announced last week, environmentalists were hoping that China would set a 2025 target for reaching peak emissions. Those hopes were dashed. China’s industrial strategy will remain heavily dependent on burning fossil fuels. In a way, this is not entirely surprising. While China’s rapid growth over the past 40 years has eradicated extreme poverty, a large part of its population – hundreds of millions – are still poor by advanced country standards. For China’s leaders, there is a trade-off between action to tackle the climate crisis and the desire to boost the incomes of its lowest-paid citizens by growing the economy. Beijing is not alone in this. In last week’s budget, Rishi Sunak defended his decision to leave fuel duty unchanged, on the grounds that raising it would increase the cost of living, which is true enough. Similarly, the government has announced that it intends to help the aviation industry by cutting air passenger duty on domestic flights. For the UK as for China, there are often hard choices between the pressure to protect incomes and jobs, and the need to make progress on its climate-change agenda. Britain accounts for only 1% of global CO2 emissions, but it is reasonable for other, poorer countries to expect Johnson and his ministers to be setting an example in the run-up to Glasgow. If the prime minister thinks he can busk his way to success by turning on the charm at the last minute, he is sorely mistaken. International conferences fail because insufficient progress has been made in the months leading up to them. If the hard bargaining is left to the conference itself, then it’s far too late. Seen from this perspective, preparations for Glasgow are not going well. Poor countries say, with justification, that rich countries have historically been responsible for the heating of the planet, and if they now want green growth then they are going to have pay for it. There could hardly have been a worse time for Britain to cut its aid budget. Similarly, the budget was an opportunity for the government to let the rest of the world know that it was serious about speeding up the UK’s progress to net zero. As someone who believes that tax incentives matter, Rishi Sunak could have scrapped VAT for people retro-fitting their homes. He could have announced steps to improve and better fund the government’s green home grants, which subsidise energy efficiency. He could have framed the UK’s recovery from the pandemic as a Green New Deal. Instead of which, there were a few modest announcements – a new national infrastructure bank and a net-zero innovation fund – that will certainly not have persuaded China, or any other developing country, of the need to show willing in the buildup to Glasgow. Their message to the UK will be: if you want us to get serious, get serious yourself.  Larry Elliott is the Guardian’s economics editor \\n',\n",

       "  'full_article': 'The frenzy of stock market trading linked to “meme stocks” such as GameStop has helped the investing website IG Group attract a record number of traders. Retail investors piled into shares including GameStop, a US video game retailer, after users on the social media website Reddit banded together to raise its price. The share price surge drew massive interest, including from people who had never invested before, as retail investors hoped for the chance of giving Wall Street a black eye. The biggest winners from the rapid stock market gains during the retail trading mania remain unclear, but the surge in trading volumes has helped spreadbetting companies such as IG and its rival, CMC Markets, which allow speculation on shares. IG, a member of the FTSE 250 index, said it made revenues of £230m in the three months to 28 February, 65% higher than the same period last year. June Felix, IG’s chief executive, said it had been “one of the busiest periods in IG’s history” as it coped with the influx of new customers drawn by widespread media coverage of the Reddit investing phenomenon. IG added 40,300 new clients during the quarter, with a total of 230,100 active over the period. It is understood that the first day of the GameStop frenzy was its record day for new customers, with six times more sign-ups than its previous record – the day when the drug company Pfizer announced positive results for the first coronavirus vaccine. IG eventually banned customers from making leveraged bets on GameStop shares, which have been through volatile trading ever since.   Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk   Most of IG’s revenues come from spreadbetting, but its smaller business executing share trades also jumped to £14m, up 600% from the same period last year, as investors tried to jump on the Reddit bandwagon. The company, which focuses on wealthier customers who are subject to less regulatory scrutiny, turned away thousands of would-be customers during that period as it coped with the influx. They were “exceptional levels of trading activity”, IG said in a statement to the stock market on Thursday. It expected to benefit permanently from revenues from the extra customers.

Newman was due to perform for the UK at 2020’s event, before it was cancelled because of the coronavirus pandemic. His song My Last Breath hasn’t been carried over to the 2021 event.    Where My Last Breath was a Coldplay-like swelling anthem, Embers radically ups the tempo for a song about enduring passion that Newman says has resonances with the approaching end point of the pandemic. “When we were writing this, it felt like I wanted to show everyone that we were coming back together,” Newman told the BBC. “It’s about having that connection and something reigniting. It’s about us emerging from this rubbish time we’ve been having. It fits with the idea that Eurovision is coming back.” Newman has only released a handful of solo singles, but already has impressive pop pedigree. He won a Brit award in 2014 for best British single, as co-writer of Rudimental’s hit Waiting All Night. He co-wrote Blame, a UK No 1 by Calvin Harris with Newman’s pop star brother John performing vocals. He also has writing credits with artists including Little Mix, Jess Glynne, Kesha, Olly Murs and more. Newman will be looking to overcome lacklustre showings by the UK at the Eurovision song contest in recent years. In the 1990s, the UK enjoyed a Top 10 placing in every year apart from 1999, including a win in 1997 for Katrina & the Waves. But since then, the country’s popularity has fallen sharply, with only two Top 10 placings this century, and four last-place finishes, including in 2019’s contest.\\n',\n",

The decision is seen as a milestone development in women’s rights in the country. The women will be awarded between 4m Malawian kwacha (£3,600) and 10m kwacha (£9,000), according to Gladys Gondwe, registrar for the Malawi supreme court of appeal and the high court. No police officers have been charged over the incident. During violence that followed presidential elections in 2019, police were deployed to a township in the capital Lilongwe. Security personnel used teargas and attacked the public. The NGO Gender Coordination Network (NGO-GCN) documented accounts from women and girls from the area who said they had been sexually assaulted by officers.   Related: Malawi sex workers protest at 'targeted police brutality' after Covid-19 curfew   Last year the Women Lawyers Association of Malawi filed a legal complaint against the police over failure to take action against officers accused of the attacks. The high court ruled that compensation should be given and on Tuesday announced the amounts. The court also ordered the police to investigate the officers named in the allegations. Richard Chimwendo Banda, minister of homeland security, said officers would appear before an independent police commission. He added that the ministry would not appeal against the high court decision. Immaculate Maluza, president of the Women Lawyers Association, said the compensation would help the women move on from what she described as a traumatic experience. “This is progress and this is really good news. In terms of the amount, we’ve talked to the women and we’re waiting for feedback from them in terms of how they feel about the ruling,” Maluza said. “We intend to pursue the matter to its logical conclusion.

       "  'full_article': 'A party founded by school climate strikers is standing in the German local elections, hoping to entice Green party supporters and first-time voters. Two of Klimaliste’s (Climate List) founders were leaders of the student climate strikes sparked by Greta Thunberg in 2019. The party was set up less than six months ago with policies aimed at ensuring the Paris agreement climate pledges are not breached. It is on the ballot for this weekend’s elections in the German state of Baden-Württemberg. The founders, all of whom are under 35, say they felt they had no choice: they live in the only state in Germany led by the Green party, yet they see more support going to the powerful local car industry than to renewable energy. One of Klimaliste’s early successes was to push the other parties in the state government, including the Greens, to incorporate the 2016 Paris pledge to limit global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels into their manifesto programmes.    The German Green party candidate campaigning in Stuttgart, Baden-Württemberg, where they are facing opposition from Klimaliste. Photograph: Thomas Kienzle/AFP/Getty Images   Some members considered this job done and left to reassert their support for the Greens. Other members did not trust the other parties to act on their promises, so they stayed. Klimaliste’s policies include a total switch to renewables within five years, a fair transition away from fossil fuels, the introduction of a citizens’ assembly and lowering the voting age. To run in the election, the founders had to register Klimaliste as a party, recruit two candidates for each of the 70 districts in the state and collect 5,000 signatures – all during the pandemic. One candidate, Cordula Markert, 30, who spent her last two birthdays camping out with Extinction Rebellion, says the processes for starting a party were designed for a pre-digital era and there were times when she thought they may not make it through the bureaucratic quagmire. Markert admits that the party’s flat organisational structure can be inefficient but says it models the kind of direct democracy Klimaliste would like to see in action. Since September 2020 the party has grown to about 450 members, many of them activists and scientists. In part, Klimaliste is a product of the disappointment many members feel towards the Baden-Württemberg Green party, which they believe has made too many compromises for the sake of power and popularity and has not been bold enough in responding to the climate emergency. Polls suggest the Greens will secure a solid victory in this weekend’s vote, but Klimaliste hopes to attract disillusioned Greens and a large proportion of the 500,000 first-time voters. Talks are under way about whether Klimaliste should fight in the central government elections this autumn, but some members are concerned about undermining the Green vote. Klimaliste Baden-Württemberg is part of a network that started in 2019 in Erlangen, Bavaria. Sebastian Hornschild and fellow Fridays for Future strikers were not satisfied that their demonstrations were doing enough and set up Klimaliste to run in their municipal elections. They won two seats and Hornschild, 31, is now a Klimaliste city councillor. \\n',\n",

       "  'title': \"Sarah Everard: London vigil organised to 'reclaim' city's streets\",\n",
       "  'full_article': 'A vigil to make streets and other public spaces safer for women has been organised for this weekend after Sarah Everard’s disappearance in south London. The vigil, titled Reclaim These Streets, will take place on Clapham Common bandstand at 6pm on Saturday, near where Everard was last seen as she made her way home to Brixton last week. The 33-year-old marketing executive vanished after leaving a friend’s house in Clapham at about 9pm on Wednesday and beginning a 50-minute walk home. A serving Metropolitan police officer has been arrested for her suspected kidnapping and murder, and investigators searching for her found human remains in woodland in Ashford, Kent. The remains have not yet been identified. A woman was also arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender. Since Everard went missing, social media has been flooded with women sharing their own experiences of constant safety fears when out in public, particularly at night, as well as advice for men on ways to help prevent this. The event’s Facebook page states that the vigil is for and about all women who have felt unsafe, and is open to all. Attenders are invited to “bring a light to remember those we’ve lost”. Organisers said: “It’s wrong that the response to violence against women requires women to behave differently. Women are not the problem. “We’ve all been following the tragic case of Sarah Everard over the last week. This is a vigil for Sarah, but also for all women who feel unsafe, who go missing from our streets and who face violence every day.” Attenders are told they must observe social distancing and wear a mask, and are also encouraged to use the NHS contact-tracing app. A silent vigil was held outside New Scotland Yard on Wednesday as police gave an update on the investigation. Everard’s disappearance has felt overwhelmingly close to home for many women, who have shared their own personal experiences of sexual harassment, abuse and being made to feel scared and unsafe in public spaces. Many have pointed out that this was often despite them having gone out of their way to be hyper-vigilant and avoid potentially unsafe situations, employing measures instilled in them since childhood. This includes updating friends when they have made it home, taking lengthy detours and sticking to well-lit streets, talking on the phone as a deterrent, clutching their keys, and wearing comfortable shoes in case they need to run. It has spurred a conversation online about what men can do to be more effective allies to women, which prompted the sharing of tips on how men can change their behaviour so their presence does not make women feel uncomfortable. Being active bystanders and intervening if someone looks uncomfortable, giving space and crossing the road, not blocking paths, and calling out problematic behaviour from their friends were among the suggestions for what men could do to help. Better educating men and boys on these experiences was deemed significant if societal attitudes toward women’s safety were to change. One woman tweeted: “Sarah Everard did everything we, as women, are ‘meant’ to do. It’s stuff that we have to think about, but shouldn’t – main roads, bright clothes, calling loved ones. And it didn’t work, because we aren’t the issue.” Another said: “The fact that basically every woman on here is freaked out because we all feel like we could have easily been Sarah Everard says it all really.”\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'Diane Keaton’s 10 best performances – ranked!',\n",
       "  'full_article': '10. Sleeper (1973) Some of the jokes in Sleeper are as dated as the special effects (and they looked creaky enough nearly 50 years ago). But Keaton is ethereally lovely as Luna, a socialite from the future. As always, there is an intelligence to her performance that lifts her above the weaker material, such as Woody Allen’s character floating around a field in a hydrovac suit. 9. Marvin’s Room (1996)    Comedy with clout ... Keaton and Leonardo DiCaprio in Marvin’s Room. Photograph: Tribeca Productions/Allstar   It is strange that Keaton is usually thought of as a comic actor, because she has done a hell of a lot of melodrama, including this, for which she got one of her four Oscar nominations. She plays Bessie, the “good” sister, who has been looking after her father (Hume Cronyn) while her “bad” sister, Lee (Meryl Streep), has been sort-of raising her mentally ill son, Hank (Leonardo DiCaprio). The family reunites when Bessie is diagnosed with leukaemia. Despite the premise, the movie is not slushy, with Keaton giving a performance that balances comedy and emotion. 8. The First Wives Club (1996) I have so much time for Keaton’s 90s comedies, from Manhattan Murder Mystery (1993) to Father of the Bride (1991), and The First Wives Club sums up her strengths in all of them. She is a great team player, leaving the bigger comedy to Goldie Hawn and Bette Midler, but her on-screen charisma is irresistibly empathic. She plays Annie, whose emotional fool of a husband routinely takes her for granted, until she finally finds a way to take revenge. It is the 9 to 5 of the 90s, with Keaton in the Jane Fonda role, but she makes it her own. 7. Something’s Gotta Give (2003)    Extremely endearing ... Jack Nicholson and Keaton in Something’s Gotta Give. Photograph: Warner Bros/Allstar   You would need a doctor’s prescription to find something more comforting than a Nancy Meyers movie; as the US journalist Rachel Handler said recently, Something’s Gotta Give “is like if you turned Meyers herself into a bottle of white wine and chugged it”. Keaton is extremely endearing as Meyers’ alter ego of sorts, a playwright who, through plot machinations best not investigated too closely, ends up being wooed by Keanu Reeves and Jack Nicholson simultaneously. You need to be a fleet-footed performer to be in a Meyers film and not come across as smug/annoying. Keaton is that performer. 6. Shoot the Moon (1982) Like Kramer vs Kramer, Shoot the Moon is about divorce, but whereas Kramer places all the blame on the selfish mother, here the finger is pointed squarely at the father (Albert Finney). Keaton plays the alternately furious and heartbroken wife. Movies about divorce are rarely subtle, with characters sketched in black and white, but Keaton doesn’t go for the simply downtrodden, even when confronting her husband about his affair. The joy she derives from her own affair is sweetly realised. 5. The Godfather: Part II (1974)    Emotional heart ... Keaton in The Godfather: Part II. Photograph: Moviestore/Rex/Shutterstock   The first Godfather film ends with Michael (Al Pacino) shutting out Keaton’s character, Kay, but in the second film she brings herself to the centre of what is otherwise a monument to machismo. Her lovely face is the film’s conscience, while the scene in which she tells Michael that she didn’t miscarry their son, but rather terminated him to save him from “this Sicilian thing”, is the movie’s emotional heart. As much as the killing of Fredo, Kay’s abortion is the definitive proof of Michael’s fatal moral descent. 4. Baby Boom (1987) Sure, Keaton’s first film with her longterm collaborator Meyers doesn’t have the dramatic clout of, say, Looking for Mr Goodbar (1977), but it has endured a lot better. Keaton is deliciously believable playing against type as a gung-ho Wall Street type whose life comes undone when she unexpectedly inherits a baby. Often dismissed as fluff, Baby Boom is one of the great feminist-lite films and Keaton deftly moves between drama and full-on slapstick.  3. Manhattan (1979)    An ode to New York ... Woody Allen and Keaton in Manhattan. Photograph: United Artists/Allstar   It is almost impossible to talk about Manhattan without descending into arguments about Allen’s morality. But let’s focus for now on Keaton’s performance, as the enjoyably absurd Mary. Only Allen’s greatest collaborators can take his lines and put their personality on them, instead of reciting them in an Allen-esque rhythm, and Keaton does this better than anyone. The scene of Mary and Isaac’s first date – Keaton and Allen clearly enjoying being with one another while New York looks impossibly beautiful around them – is one of the great movie date scenes. Allen and Keaton’s friendship is the warm heart of this movie. 2. Reds (1981) Like Keaton’s most famous film, Annie Hall, Reds was written and directed by, and stars, one of Keaton’s exes: Warren Beatty, in this case. As in Annie Hall, she dominates what could easily have been the man’s vanity project. Reds is ostensibly a biopic of John Reed (Beatty), the US communist activist, but Keaton’s performance as his partner, Louise Bryant, is the more involving. The scenes in which she stands up to Reed, about his infidelity, and then Eugene O’Neill (Jack Nicholson), for his cruelty, should be required viewing for those who dismiss Keaton as a ditz. 1. Annie Hall (1977)    Defining role ... Allen and Keaton in Annie Hall. Photograph: United Artists/Allstar   Not just Keaton’s most celebrated performance, but one of the most memorable performances of all time. Allen wrote it for her, using Keaton’s real surname, and only she could have captured Annie’s sweetness and fragility without descending into cloying irritation or, worse, becoming a proto manic pixie dream girl. Allen wanted the movie to be about the inability of his character, Alvy, to feel joy; Alvy is certainly the captain of this film’s ship, narrating it and dominating the action. But Annie’s warmth towers over Alvy’s depressive comedy, like a sunflower bringing light to a dark patch of the garden. • This article was amended on 11 March 2021 to more accurately describe the final scene of The Godfather and to replace an image from The Godfather with one from The Godfather: Part II. An erroneous reference to Keaton playing a banker in Baby Boom was also removed.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'Lou Ottens, inventor of the cassette tape, dies aged 94',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Lou Ottens, the Dutch engineer credited with inventing the cassette tape and playing a major role in the development of the first CD, has died aged 94 at his home in the village of Duizel in North Brabant. As product development manager at Philips, Ottens twice revolutionised the world of music, but he remained modest to the end. “We were little boys who had fun playing,” he said. “We didn’t feel like we were doing anything big. It was a kind of sport.” Ottens, born on 21 June 1926, showed an early interest in engineering, building a radio as a teenager through which he and his parents could receive Radio Oranje during Germany’s wartime occupation of the Netherlands. He equipped the device with a directional antenna that he called a “Germanenfilter” because it could avoid the jammers used by the Nazi regime. Following the war, Ottens obtained an engineering degree, and he started work at the Philips factory in Hasselt, Belgium, in 1952. Eight years later he was promoted to head of the company’s newly established product development department, and within a year he unveiled the EL 3585, Philips’s first portable tape recorder, which would go on to sell more than a million units. But it was two years later that Ottens made the biggest breakthrough of his life – born out of annoyance with the clumsy and large reel-to-reel tape systems of the time. “The cassette tape was invented out of irritation about the existing tape recorder, it’s that simple,” he would later say. Ottens’s idea was that the cassette tape that should fit in the inside pocket of his jacket. In 1963 the first tape was presented to the world at an electronics fair in Berlin with the tagline “Smaller than a pack of cigarettes!”    Ottens did not back the recent resurgence of the cassette tape. Photograph: Jerry Lampen/EPA   Photographs of the invention made their way to Japan, where substandard copies started to emerge. Ottens made agreements with Sony for the patented Philips mechanism to be the standard. It led to the mixtapes beloved by teenagers across the world and the frustration of the unspooled tape, albeit largely fixable with the insertion and twirl of a disposable pen. In 1972 Ottens became director of audio at Philips’ NatLab, where he became involved in the next major music innovation: the CD. A collaboration was entered into with Sony and in 1980 the 12cm Philips-Sony CD standard was ready for the world. More than 100bn cassette tapes and 200bn CDs have been sold. When asked about his regrets, Ottens lamented that Sony had brought out the first Walkman. “It still hurts that we didn’t have one,” he said. Ottens, who died on Saturday, had little patience with the renewed popularity of the cassette tape – or even vinyl. “Nothing can match the sound of the CD,” he had told the Dutch newspaper NRC Handelsblad. “It is absolutely noise and rumble-free. That never worked with tape … I have made a lot of record players and I know that the distortion with vinyl is much higher. I think people mainly hear what they want to hear.”\\n',\n",

       "  'title': \"Failures of State review – never forget the Johnson government's Covid disasters\",\n",
       "  'full_article': \"Publishing, like politics and like comedy, is all about timing. The timing is not right for this book, which is a damning assessment of how the UK government of Boris Johnson mishandled almost every aspect of the coronavirus crisis, so that Britain suffered both the highest death toll in Europe and an economic slump more devastating than in any other G7 nation. The timing is off because of the one thing the government got right. At this moment, polls suggest a nation grateful to be vaccinated efficiently and at speed, with case numbers and deaths falling daily, schools open once more and the first sound of the key being turned on a lockdown that has seemed to last for ever. Spring is in the air and people are itching to break free. Those chunky Tory poll leads do not suggest a public eager to immerse itself in the horrors of the last year and work out what went wrong and who to blame. That time will come, however, and when it does, this book will serve well as the charge sheet. More than that, it reads like the first draft of the report that will one day be delivered by the inevitable public inquiry, even if it is balder and more scathing than those texts, written in mandarin English – indirect, coded, implied – usually dare to be. If you’ve ever wondered what an actual catalogue of disaster might look like, look no further. Failures of State is a Christmas-at-Argos sized catalogue of the government’s errors, page after page filled with its mistakes, misjudgments and even its possibly actionable crimes (it quotes lawyers who believe Johnson could be charged with “gross negligence manslaughter”). The authors are Jonathan Calvert and George Arbuthnott, investigative journalists and custodians of the storied Insight brand at the Sunday Times. There might be the odd Guardian reader who assumes the Murdoch press would never lay a glove on this Tory government. They should have been parted from that misconception when Calvert and Arbuthnott published last April what they tell us is the most read story in the online history of the Times or Sunday Times, an evisceration of Johnson’s pandemic response that was headlined “Coronavirus: 38 days when Britain sleepwalked into disaster”, revealing among other things that Johnson had failed to attend the first five Cobra meetings called to marshal the UK’s response. But Failures of State surely settles the matter.    Michael Gove in Downing Street, September 2020. Photograph: Barcroft Media/Getty Images   Some acts of negligence are, like that serial Cobra truancy, already well known. Still, there is a value in having laid out before you just how costly, for example, Johnson’s thrice-repeated delay in introducing lockdown proved to be. Three times it was screamingly obvious that the public would have to stay at home if the virus were to be reined in, and three times Johnson waited and waited: in March, in September and again this winter. The authors cite Imperial College modelling, which found that over the course of the combined 68 days that Johnson hesitated before imposing those three lockdowns, the number of infections that spread across Britain totalled 4.5m. “On each occasion, he had been advised to act immediately.” There is poor judgment wherever you look, leaving the reader by turns baffled and furious all over again. We read of the cabinet row in late March, when the first lockdown had already begun, over whether to close the country’s borders to flights from known virus hotspots. No, said the Foreign Office: that would complicate efforts to bring home Brits stranded abroad. All right, thinks the reader, then surely the government would close the borders once all returning Brits were safely back. But no. The flights kept coming. There are lesser-known horrors in the catalogue too. The authors are keen to explode the comforting narrative that the NHS coped with the pandemic even at its peak, and that everyone got the care they needed. They report that some hospitals were forced to ration treatment according to a set of guidelines that struck doctors and nurses as “Nazi-like”, denying intensive care to those who scored too high on three metrics: age, frailty and underlying conditions. Whole categories of people – the old, the weak, the disabled – were denied the critical care that might have saved their lives. Incredibly, the guidelines were so rigorously enforced that in one Midlands hospital, dozens of intensive care beds lay empty, kept free for younger, fitter patients, while those over-75 were left dying on regular wards, without even being offered non-invasive ventilation. It meant that of the patients who died at the height of the pandemic in April, just 10% had received any intensive care.   The £185,000 a year head of Public Health England breezily admitted that his public health credentials could fit 'on a postage stamp'   Word of all this hardly reached beyond the doctors, nurses and families who suffered through it. An omerta was imposed on hospitals to keep the reality on the wards hidden. The Unison trade union alleges that managers at Nottingham’s Queen’s medical centre, for example, locked away vital PPE “as punishment” after staff on a Covid ward raised concerns. Meanwhile, Matt Hancock was on TV saying everything was under control. It’s all here, the £185,000 a year head of Public Health England who breezily admitted that his public health credentials could fit “on a postage stamp”, along with the national stockpile of PPE supplies that had, thanks to austerity, been left to moulder in a Merseyside warehouse, much of it well past its use-by date. The shelves were full of respirators whose true expiry date was 2012, the labels simply replaced with new ones giving an end date of 2016, with another label placed on top of that one, claiming the devices were suitable for use in 2020. What explains this failure upon failure? The book describes “government by ADHD”, with ministers from Johnson down making crucial decisions “on the hoof” or “winging it” and hoping for the best. There’s an accusing finger pointed very directly at Rishi Sunak for ignoring advice and pushing to keep things open in the name of kickstarting the economy, even though it was obvious that what would hurt the economy most would be lockdowns that had to run long because they came too late. (By contrast, Michael Gove is regularly presented as the voice of sober realism in the face of the pandemic, a gloss which has one wondering if the loquacious minister might perhaps have been a generous source to two journalists working for his former employer at Times Newspapers.) Above all, it describes a government that only had eyes for Brexit, that had diverted whatever contingency planning capacity it had to a no-deal scenario rather than to a looming pandemic.    A lateral flow testing centre in Portsmouth, February 2021. Photograph: Finnbarr Webster/Getty Images   The authors have little patience for Johnson’s defence that any failings are only visible now with the benefit of what the PM likes to call the “retrospectoscope”. By way of rebuttal, they reproduce the warnings scientists were giving back in January 2020, spelling out the dangers and urging swift action. Two are quoted, accusing Downing Street of twisting their words to suggest that it was they, the experts, who had underestimated the severity of the threat, a move Richard Horton, editor of the Lancet, calls a “Kremlinesque” attempt at “government disinformation”. As Horton puts it: “They really are scared that the verdict of history is going to condemn them for contributing to the deaths of tens of thousands of British citizens … They are desperately trying to rewrite the timeline of what happened. And we must not let them do that.” Calvert and Arbuthnott have exposed the failings of Johnson, his ministers, advisers and many others. What, perhaps, is missing – besides a fuller look at the scandal of test and trace, with its indefensible £37bn price tag – is the larger accusation hinted at in the title: the failures of the British state that made this disaster likely, regardless of who was in charge. Is there a more deep-rooted arrogance and complacency, a lack of care, that went beyond, and predated, Johnson and Dominic Cummings? Maybe that question will have to wait. For now, this is the book to throw at those who were meant to protect the British public and failed in their duty. This vaccine spring may not be the moment for that reckoning. But it will come, one day. • Failures of State: The Inside Story of Britain’s Battle with Coronavirus is published by Mudlark (£20). To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com.

       "  'full_article': \"France reached their nadir at Twickenham two years ago. A record defeat by England prompted their experienced half-backs Camille Lopez and Morgan Parra to publicly question the way the side were coached, or not coached in their words. They were dropped for the next match and replaced by Romain Ntamack and Antoine Dupont, hope emerging from despair. France were coached then by Jacques Brunel. He was hastily appointed after the national side’s messy divorce with Guy Novès. As a pal of the French Rugby Federation’s president, Bernard Laporte, he was only too happy to sign a pre-nup while his employers searched for a more suitable partner.   Related: Free-flowing Wales shaping up to be unlikely Six Nations champions     That turned out to be Fabien Galthié, who was dropped into Brunel’s management team for the 2019 World Cup. By the end of the tournament, the team bore more of his imprint than that of the nominal head coach, with Charles Ollivon and Grégory Alldritt installed in the back row, Bernard Le Roux at lock and Virimi Vakatawa and Gaël Fickou in midfield; not to forget Ntamack and Dupont. The only two starters at Twickenham two years ago who were in the team that played Ireland in France’s most recent match in this year’s Six Nations were Damian Penaud and Fickou, who was on the wing that afternoon. That compares with six in the 2019 quarter-final defeat by Wales, a side that included Vakatawa and Ntamack, who missed the Dublin encounter through injury. France were a shambles two years ago. They turned up at Twickenham to face a side renowned for their kicking without a recognised full-back and were duly exposed. England secured the try bonus point before half-time against a team that had won only seven Six Nations matches since the 2015 World Cup and just two away from Paris, against Italy and Scotland.    The France team are dejected after England’s third try at Twickenham in 2019. Only two of the starting XV that day played Ireland last month. Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian   England, in contrast, were on their way up, even if they lost in Cardiff in the next round and missed out on the title. Eleven of their starting side two years ago took the field in Cardiff 12 days ago: two of the absentees were injured, Manu Tuilagi and Courtney Lawes, while Maro Itoje missed the 2019 match. Only Chris Ashton and George Kruis are now out of contention, but Eddie Jones’s preference for a settled side is being questioned after two defeats this year. “The bloke’s a genius. I never see him have a bad game and that’s why he’s one of the best players in the world, if not the best. It’s amazing to be playing with a captain who is as dominant as he is and who leads from the front in the way that he does.” The England hooker Jamie George was talking about Owen Farrell after the 44-8 victory over France but, two years on, players are having to defend a player whose place in the side, never mind his leadership, has become increasingly questioned. Jones is loyal to players who have served him, the England head coach needing more than one or two off-days to persuade him to contemplate whether there has been a paradigm shift.   Related: Pirates' stellar win offers lessons for Eddie Jones and English rugby | Robert Kitson   One question is whether England are a side more in the image of Farrell, who made his Test debut in 2012, than Jones, who pitched up four years later. In tournaments Jones has used two fly-halves, Farrell and George Ford, regularly deploying the former at inside-centre. Marcus Smith and Jacob Umaga have been given a taste of life in the squad without coming near to selection, while Danny Cipriani was teased in the buildup to the World Cup before being omitted. Cipriani’s one appearance under Jones came in the third Test against South Africa in 2018, when the series had been lost. His kick for Jonny May helped conjure victory but Farrell’s facial expressions at times during the match indicated he did not have confidence in the fly-half who had replaced someone with whom he went back a long way, Ford. Jones never discusses the rugby reasons behind his decisions to leave out players. His one observation about Cipriani was that he did not think that the player would be content with a bit-part role in the squad; he was someone who either had to be first-choice or overlooked. If Cipriani struggled to integrate himself in the squad in South Africa, was that more down to him or his captain? Was he welcome?    Pascal Gaüzère awards a penalty against England in Cardiff. Eddie Jones’s side did not adjust to how the breakdown was being refereed. Photograph: David Rogers/The RFU Collection/Getty Images   Farrell has come to define England with his competitiveness, attention to detail, defensive organisation and ability to execute a gameplan, but as Jones anticipates a greater emphasis on more open, unstructured play leading up to the 2023 World Cup, he will have to consider whether he needs someone more instinctive at the helm. It is not that England are now where France were two years ago, far from it, but the side that dismantled New Zealand in the World Cup semi-final has scarcely been seen since and the recurrent failure to react to events, highlighted by the failure to adapt to the way Pascal Gaüzère refereed the breakdown in Cardiff, is a weakness that will prevent them becoming, in Jones’s words, the greatest team the world has ever seen.   Sign up for the Breakdown.  The word culture was used a lot by the previous England regime, and perhaps now is the time for another change. France used to alter their side for the sake of it and the result was wretched inconsistency, but the danger of making few voluntary changes is a feeling of comfort that turns into complacency, cancerous in a competitive environment. Two years ago, France arrived at Twickenham with no discernible plan. All that could be said about them was that they never gave up. The considerable distance between the sides then has closed and, after winning in Cardiff last year for the first time in a decade and ending a 10-year drought in Dublin last month, France now have only Twickenham to topple. A reaction to the defeat in Wales will not be enough for England: they need to start using their heads. • This is an extract from our weekly rugby union email, the Breakdown.

       "  'title': \"Loretta Lynn: Still Woman Enough review | Alexis Petridis's album of the week\",\n",
       "  'full_article': 'In 2018, Loretta Lynn gave every impression of having quietly retired. Who could blame her? She was 86 years old and had recently suffered from a stroke and a broken hip, caused by a fall at home. Besides, she had presided over one of country music’s most extraordinary careers: since 1960, she has cut an authentically groundbreaking figure, such a trailblazer for women in country that one writer suggested most modern female country artists could be called Lynettes. Her brand of “advocacy for ordinary women” – she is “not a big fan” of the term “feminist”, considering it to be insufficiently concerned with working-class women – bordered on the confrontational, at least by the conservative standards of Nashville.    Loretta Lynn: Still Woman Enough album cover Photograph: Publicity image   The horrified reaction to her 1975 single The Pill is legendary – the song was suppressed for three years, then banned by country radio stations on release – but it’s just one in a succession of two-fisted reproaches of patriarchal mores. On 2018’s Wouldn’t It Be Great? – an album recorded before, but released after, her illness – she re-recorded one classic example, 1967’s Don’t Come Home A-Drinkin’, a song that hides a dark saga of sexual consent behind its wry humour. She did the same with her autobiographical theme song Coal Miner’s Daughter. It felt like a neat way of tying things up: that, one might have assumed, was that. And yet, here we are, three years on, with Lynn weeks away from her 89th birthday and a new album named after her second volume of autobiography. Its cover depicts the singer clad in one of her trademark gowns, sitting on a throne and wearing an expression that suggests – as so many of her songs do – a woman who’s had enough of your bullshit, or perhaps a woman who’s heard you’ve been spreading rumours about her retirement and isn’t terribly pleased about it. Its contents speak of an understandable decline in songwriting productivity – there’s only one new Lynn original, the title track, co-written with her daughter; Coal Miner’s Daughter makes yet another appearance, this time as a recitation of the lyrics set to music – but her voice sounds frankly astonishing. The woman singing I Wanna Be Free has a slightly flintier tone than the woman who first recorded it 50 years ago, but she still sounds strident and authoritative: there’s none of the diminution in clout you might expect from someone whose professional career is now into its seventh decade. Certainly, her guest stars – Reba McEntire, Carrie Underwood, Tanya Tucker and Margo Price – never feel like they’re there to do the heavy lifting vocally, or bolster a waning talent: they sound like they’re sparring with her, particularly Price, who performs on a version of 1971’s One’s on the Way, a classic Lynn saga of domestic strife (albeit one written by Shel Silverstein, best-known as the author of Johnny Cash’s A Boy Named Sue). The cultural references – Liz Taylor, Raquel Welch, Jackie Onassis – might have dated, but the song’s theme seems timeless: it deals with the gulf between a perfectly airbrushed world of celebrity and the reality of daily life, as relevant in the Instagram age as it was when it was written.   Loretta Lynn and Margo Price discuss the making of One’s on the Way – video  Other covers delve so deep into country’s history that Hank Williams’ I Saw the Light – breezily rendered by Lynn here – counts as relatively recent, the original merely having been recorded in 1948. There are three songs from the 1930s oeuvre of the Carter Family and the standard Old Kentucky Home, a song first published in 1853. Whether religious or secular in theme, they’re linked by a tone of steely determination that suits Lynn perfectly. The protagonist of I’ll Be All Smiles Tonight declines to show weakness while watching the man she loves marry someone else; the hard-boiled stoicism of I Don’t Feel at Home Anymore found popularity among dust bowl refugees in the 1930s, its tone of acceptance so infuriating Woody Guthrie that he rewrote it, throwing in a reference to Donald Trump’s racist father for good measure. Guthrie saw the song as meek, but Lynn sings it with an affecting combination of joy and conviction.

The subject of You Ain’t Woman Enough fares better than that of 1968’s Fist City (“I’ll grab you by the hair of your head and lift you off the ground”) but not much. “For you to get to him, I’ll have to move over,” she sings, “and I’m gonna stand right here – it’ll be over my dead body.” Delightfully enough, she sounds like she means every word: there’s a toughness that doubtless accounts for Still Woman Enough’s very existence. Long may she decline to budge.

       "  'title': \"The Green New Deal's time has come – but where has Labour's radicalism gone? | Adam Tooze\",\n",
       "  'full_article': 'What a difference power makes. The past 18 months saw political defeats for the left on both sides of the Atlantic. Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership of the Labour party came to an end after a resounding Conservative victory. The Bernie Sanders campaign went down at the hands of the Democrat establishment. And yet the bitter irony of 2020 was that just as the political hopes of the left were dashed, the strategic analysis of the Green New Deal – the centrepiece of its policy vision – was spectacularly vindicated. The Green New Deal demanded that social and economic policy should be oriented towards the immediate planetary challenge of the environment. Its proponents, groups such as the Sunrise Movement, put a “just transition” front and centre; this means fairly managing the social harms such as unemployment that would arise from an accelerated shift away from fossil fuels. Then, as if on cue, the coronavirus arrived, and delivered a devastating “inequality shock” forcing even the likes of the Financial Times to talk about a new social contract. The Green New Deal’s politics emerged from a recognition of the fact that there was unfinished business from the financial crisis of 2008; climate activists warned that we were harnessed to a dangerous financial flywheel and demanded that finance be turned in a constructive direction. The thinking was based on the notion that the status quo was the one thing that we could not have: the events of 2020 confirmed precisely how dangerous and precarious our reality is. In the US, this feeling was compounded by Donald Trump’s terrifying antics and the killing of George Floyd. Even Joe Biden, as centrist as it gets, has been moved to speak of four converging crises – Covid-19, the economy, racial justice and the climate. Nor is this merely a rhetorical framing. The Biden administration has assimilated a large part of the Sanders agenda. The double stimulus programmes planned for 2021 are unprecedented. The administration is clearly serious about climate. It is forced, by the balance of power inside the Democratic party, to put race and environmental justice at the heart of its policies. This assimilation of the left programme into the centre is made possible by victory. It is based on a confidence that a broad-church progressive coalition can win a majority in the US. Furthermore, the Republicans have done the Democrats the favour of vacating the middle ground almost entirely. The contrast to the UK is painful. Reeling from its bitter defeat, languishing in the opinion polls, Keir Starmer’s Labour party diagnoses a polycrisis too, but it consists not of issues of global significance, but of Brexit, the collapse of the “red wall” and the question of Scotland. Questions of identity overshadow everything. Rather than seriously questioning what the nation might be, as the combination of Trump and Black Lives Matter is forcing liberal America to do, Labour appears to be content with trying to reclaim the union flag from the Conservative party. Starmer’s long-awaited “big speech” last month was an exercise in sophomoric national cliche. He managed to be sentimental even in the passages about British business. References to the blitz and 1945 formed the anchor. The climate crisis got a single line, with one other passing reference. The Mais lecture by the shadow chancellor, in January, was weightier. Unlike Starmer, Anneliese Dodds did in fact seriously discuss the climate emergency, but it is no longer the organising framework that it once was, no longer the pacesetter, the imperative to action. The only thing that matters is to convince some key voters that Labour is responsible enough to be trusted as a steward of the economy.  Though “acceleration” was one of Dodds’s key terms – a reference to the way the pandemic has amplified pre-existing trends such as flexible working and digitalisation – she managed nevertheless to offer a curiously muted vision of the huge challenges facing the UK and the world economy. No doubt the pollsters have fine-tuned these messages with target segments of the electorate. But if you do not belong to that audience, if you understand your identity to be complex and multiple, if you have ever been on the bitter end of the politics of patriotism, then flag-waving repels. If a little thought about society and politics has taught you to regard “common sense” as the most dangerous of snares, you cannot but worry about a party so desperate to please the Daily Mail. Labour’s retreat from radicalism means that the initiative belongs to the Johnson government. Having done Brexit, it can look to the future. It leads even on climate. After destroying the miners union in the 1980s, the Tories may end up presiding over historic decarbonisation. After vaccines they will claim Britain’s hosting of Cop26 as a victory too. Ahead of the 2024 election, the Tories will no doubt pivot to “fiscal responsibility”, but as the budget makes clear, they are spending as the situation demands. Labour is left to harp on value for money. The independent Bank of England created by Gordon Brown is now merrily buying bonds to finance Rishi Sunak’s spending. Whereas experts aligned with the Labour party were once leading a global conversation about redefining central bank independence in a progressive direction, the shadow chancellor now proposes to treat its independence as inviolable. Not so the Tory chancellor, who has added climate to the bank’s mandate. No doubt the Corbynite left was too in love with its own radicalism. But the Green New Deal was not radicalism for its own sake. It was radical because reality demanded it. Faced with the 2008 global financial crisis and its aftermath, the world historic presence of China, Trump, the escalating climate crisis, and an unprecedented global pandemic, what more is needed to demonstrate this point? A politics that does not want to mobilise around these challenges, which prefers to deal in patriotic pastiche, forfeits any claim to be progressive. The disinhibited politics of the new global right recognises this radical reality, though in the form of fantasy, denial and conspiracy. Global capital is swinging full tilt behind its own version of a Green New Deal. Hundreds of billions is now sloshing into renewable energy. The restructuring and job losses about to happen in the global automotive industry will put every previous reorganisation in the shade. In the age of the great acceleration, Corbyn’s politics at least rose to the challenge of recognising that the future would be different. Labour’s new look – the Little Britain to come – promises a nostalgic road back to the future. It is, in reality, a dangerous dead end.

       "  'full_article': 'My friend Mike Carey, who has died aged 71, was a pioneer in the development of speech recognition and digital audio, including digital audio broadcasting (DAB). After a formative period at the Post Office research labs, Keele University and Mitel Telecom, he left in 1985 with Adrian Anderson and me to establish Ensigma, a company that quickly established itself as a leader in the research and development of digital speech and audio applications, with uses in mobile telephony, broadcasting and automated speech recognition systems. Mike was born in Preston, to Ethel (nee Glover), a weaver and housewife, and Stephen, a miner-cum-decorator. At Preston Catholic college, a local grammar, he met Elizabeth Mercer at a school dance, for once beating the cross-country champion across the floor. They married in 1969, by which time Mike was on a Post Office scholarship to study electrical engineering at Imperial College, London, supported throughout by extra work taken on by his parents. Mike had a strong business sense, as well as a razor-sharp mind and deep understanding of the engineering and technology that he worked on. Much of Ensigma’s business derived from licensing designs for incorporation into semiconductors and third-party products. He was a strong believer in education and in the importance of the links between industry and universities. This was demonstrated by collaborations with the universities of Bristol, Swansea, East Anglia, Manchester and Liverpool (among others) that included projects, student and staff placements and joint publications. Mike had numerous patents and international papers in the field of speech recognition and speaker verification that are still being referenced today. In 2000 he negotiated a takeover that gave Ensigma the critical mass to compete successfully on the world stage. After being diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease in 2005 he retired but worked as an honorary professor at Birmingham University, where he continued his research and supervised a number of PhD students. Mike was an immensely talented man of great determination, ambition, focus and great energy. Outside work, wine and classical music were great passions, and he was an early adopter of top end hi-fi equipment, including electro-static speakers that brooked no compromise in their place in his house. Elizabeth worked with him in the business from the beginning, and cared for him throughout his illness. She survives him, as do their three children and eight grandchildren, and his sister.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': \"Minneapolis promised change after George Floyd. Instead it's geared up for war | Akin Olla\",\n",
       "  'full_article': 'The George Floyd uprising that began in Minneapolis introduced the demand of defunding the police to the general public, empowered Black-led anti-police violence movements across the planet, generated policy changes in cities across the US, and most importantly built new organizations which have the capacity to fight for systemic change for the long haul. The uprising brought a lot of reforms and positive developments to its birth city, too, including a move to actually defund the Minneapolis police department and redistribute funds to services with a larger potential for eradicating both crime and poverty. Now, however, the Minneapolis and Minnesota governments are in the process of undoing that progress and moving in the opposite direction. The trial of Derek Chauvin, the officer who publicly killed 46-year-old George Floyd – and inadvertently triggered what may have been the largest protest movement in US history – began this week. Instead of becoming more transparent and committed to undoing the anti-Black image it has cultivated, the city of Minneapolis has quickly transformed itself into a 21st-century police state, pushing even beyond the hyper-militarization and violence that already plague police departments across the US. For a while it seemed that Minneapolis was headed on a better path. A veto-proof majority of city council members previously promised to dismantle the police department and build something better to replace it. Their attempts were dashed by the Minneapolis Charter Commission that shut down a ballot initiative that would have given voters the chance to abolish the police department in favor of a proposed department of community safety and violence prevention. By this winter, the summer’s ambitions had been replaced by a renewed commitment to the status quo. The police budget was cut by a mere $8m – out of a total budget of $179m – and a proposal to modestly reduce the size of the police force was shot down by city council members and Mayor Jacob Frey, who would be more useful to the world as a Justin Trudeau impersonator than an elected official. While the cut is a step towards disinvesting in police, it pales in comparison to the city council’s more genuinely radical rhetoric. Some of the blame for this policy about-face lies with the city’s rising violent crime rate and the subsequent push by some within Minneapolis for increased policing. This uptick in crime has been seen across the country and may add fuel to fiery opposition to police abolition activism. In fact, adding more police is hardly ever the real solution to increased crime rates, though it is often the first that cities reach for. There is no conclusive evidence that the overpolicing of the 1990s and the rise of mass incarceration is what caused the decline in crime that occurred towards the end of that decade. A growing number of sociologists and other social scientists believe that there is a abundance of historical evidence that shows that violent crime, particularly murder, is deeply correlated with political instability and a lack of faith in government institutions. Considering the pandemic and decades of unresolved social crises like police violence against Black people (only one Minnesota police officer has been convicted for on-duty killing in recent history), it shouldn’t surprise us that public trust in government is near historic lows. Increasing police presence, especially in moments of justified tension, will only continue this trend. That seems like the direction that the state of Minnesota, and Minneapolis more specifically, is headed as they prepare for protests in response to a potential acquittal of yet another police officer caught executing someone on camera. Governor Tim Walz has issued an order authorizing national guard troops to be sent into Minneapolis at the request of Frey. The governor has also proposed $35m in state aid to fund the deployment of police officers from across the state to support the Minneapolis police department in the case of “extraordinary public safety events”. The state is also coordinating with the FBI, the federal joint terrorism taskforce, and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The Hennepin county government center, the location of the trial, is being turned into a fortress. Several layers of high-security barbed-wire fences line the area around the center and a few buildings around it; they are reinforced with large concrete barriers which, combined with up to 2,000 national guard soldiers, give the impression that the city is ready to fight its own people. Speaking to ABC News, Kandace Montgomery, the current co-director of the local Black liberation organization Black Visions, responded to the city’s preparations: “As the people of Minneapolis and Minnesota are calling for justice and healing, and care, state officials have been responding in some ways by basically preparing to go to war with folks … So, I do think it’s meant to be an intimidation tactic.” In arguably its most dystopian move, the city also wanted to pay social media influencers to share messages during the trial to prevent potential rioting. The city planned on giving six influencers $2,000 a day each to combat “misinformation”. In January the city approved over a million dollars to fund a communication strategy that would include community organizations and influencers, specifically targeting “Black, Somali/East African, Native American, Hmong and Hispanic” communities by sharing “city-generated and approved messages” – which local activists have compared to the Ghetto Informant Program that Cointelpro used to hinder Black movements in the 1960s. After anger from community members, the influencer plan has been scrapped, though the city still plans on communicating with local leaders – excluding organizations like Black Visions who helped popularize the “defund the police” demand. People in Minneapolis are preparing for the trial in their own ways. Some organizers have already planned protests, while others are rebuilding mutual aid networks to support each other with grocery runs and resources in case of unrest. The Corcoran Neighborhood Organization is encouraging text chains among neighbors and has initiated neighborhood patrols. Frey insists that these preparations are unnecessary, but there is a strong lack of faith in the city’s ability to keep people safe, from police, and white supremacists, who have occasionally used moments of upheaval to attack protesters, like the 2015 shooting of five Minneapolis activists by white supremacists during protests over the police killing of Jamar Clark. The city’s plans thus far seem to be more concerned about what have statistically been peaceful protests than with the very real threat of white supremacist violence. Instead of committing to police reform and transparency – or acknowledging the growing threat of the far right – the city of Minneapolis is, in the words of city councilman Jeremiah Ellison, “showing up ready for war”.

       "  'title': 'What if the most important election of the year is happening right now in Alabama? | Indigo Olivier',\n",
       "  'full_article': \"This month, 5,800 Amazon warehouse employees in Bessemer, Alabama, will be voting on whether or not to unionize with the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union in what could turn out to be the most important election of the year. While the Bessemer fulfillment center itself is a drop in the bucket when compared to Amazon’s roughly 500 facilities around the country, this could be the ballot heard around the world. If successful, this election would mark the first unionized Amazon facility in the US.   Related: Amazon's mushrooming power has met an unlikely foe: Bessemer, Alabama | Hamilton Nolan   Over the past 26 years, Jeff Bezos has built himself a private empire. Amazon is now the second largest employer in the US, after Walmart, and the fifth largest in the world. The more than 800,000 Amazon employees across the country represent a population between the size of Maine and Montana. Globally, the company employs more than 1 million workers. Amazon is also the largest online retailer in the world, with a market cap (or value of the company’s shares) at $1.5tn – larger than the GDPs of most countries. The power this company yields is unrivaled. Yet Amazon’s success has been made possible by the labor of the underpaid and overworked employees who keep operations running; by weakened anti-trust laws; by a larger US economic shift from manufacturing to the service and logistics sectors; and, of course, by generous government subsidies, which have seen the company get away with paying no taxes in recent years. Unions alone will not bring Amazon to heel – but without them, all bets are off. The message this election will send to workers is: if we can do it in the anti-labor, “right-to-work” south against one of the most powerful companies in the world – one with no scruples with regards to its anti-union tactics – then workers can unionize anywhere. It would be a marked shift since Ronald Reagan’s mass firing of striking air traffic control workers, which caused a chilling effect on organized labor and ushered in a new pro-business, anti-worker era. Labor organizers are hoping that a victory in Bessemer might turn this tide. The labor movement recognizes the significance of this election. Members of the AFL-CIO and nurses from a recently unionized hospital in North Carolina have been phone banking to speak with Bessemer workers directly about the importance of voting yes on a union. Supporters have also made it clear that the fight at the Bessemer facility, where about 85% of workers are Black, is also a fight for racial justice. Biden’s recent statement in support of workers organizing in Alabama suggests that under this administration significant gains for labor can be won, but only if workers are willing to fight for them. One of the biggest lies sold to the American public has been to convince the vast majority of people that “politics” means showing up to the polls every few years to elect representative officials who will take it from there. Like many aspects of our lives, politics has become something to consume passively. It’s cable news networks, the punditry class, bumper stickers, lawn signs, campaign donations. It’s horse-race journalism and partisan tabloids.   A union victory for one workplace is a victory for all workers   It has narrowed the spectrum of the “political” to red and blue, kids in cages or “migrant overflow facilities”, dog whistles over bull horns, an open disdain for working people or a veneer of compassion. Far fewer see the actions they take day-to-day, in the workplaces where we spend the majority of our waking lives, as something worthy of being political. The Bessemer election has the potential to topple this frame in favor of a new horizon. The difference between electoral politics and labor organizing is the difference between voting in a president who says he will phase in the minimum wage to $15 an hour over the next four years – yet surrenders before the battle begins – and taking direct action to ensure that higher wages are guaranteed in your contract immediately. Amazon prides itself on paying its workers $15 an hour – more than double the federal minimum wage – plus benefits. But rather than being a product of the benevolence of an enlightened CEO, we should all understand this to be a Machiavellian tactic used to preempt the serfs from storming the castle. More importantly, workers organizing towards a union must recognize that in the long run, without labor protections, every employee lives under the dictates of an unforgiving and despotic market. These “tides” will only turn when workers see themselves as a unified force and recognize that a union victory for one workplace is a victory for all workers. It favors a rising tide that will lift all boats to the trickle-down economics that have left us in perpetual drought. The Bessemer election is not one in which fulfillment center employees will cast their ballots and abdicate all further responsibilities. Rather, this vote would open the floodgates.

       "  'full_article': 'Max Malins will make his first England start against France on Saturday, with Elliot Daly dropped to the bench by Eddie Jones. Luke Cowan-Dickie and Charlie Ewels also come into the side as Jones makes three changes to the starting XV who lost to Wales last time out. Malins has caught the eye in his six appearances from the bench so far – not least in the Autumn Nations Cup final against France in December – and finally gets his chance from the off on Saturday. His combined playing time in the tournament so far is less than 30 minutes but, with Daly struggling for form, Jones has seen fit to give the 24-year-old his chance.   Related: CVC concludes 18-month saga with £365m deal to buy into Six Nations   Ollie Lawrence also returns to the match-day squad as a replacement while Cowan-Dickie comes back into the side to replace Jamie George at hooker, having impressed on his first championship start against Italy. Indeed, he was unfortunate to lose his starting place against Wales but gets another shot against France, having scored the try against Les Bleus in December to force extra time. Ewels is selected alongside Maro Itoje in the second row with Jonny Hill – who endured a difficult afternoon in Cardiff – dropping to the bench. It is believed Jones was giving consideration to selecting Itoje at blindside flanker in the absence of Courtney Lawes but instead he has kept faith with the back-row combination against Wales. That means Ben Earl – another who is thought to have been close to starting – again settles for a place on the bench, with Mark Wilson, Tom Curry and Billy Vunipola continuing. While Malins’ selection is the most eye-catching – and in dropping Daly and George, Jones has left out two of his six Saracens contingent – the head coach has resisted wholesale changes despite the fact England have in effect relinquished their Six Nations title. France are chasing the grand slam, as are Wales, who will officially end England’s title hopes with victory in Italy on Saturday.     “This France game is one we are really looking forward to,” said Jones. “We are of course disappointed that we can’t defend the championship, but that makes this an even more important game. We want to show what we are capable of. The squad have competed really hard in training since Sunday. I believe this is the best 23 to really take the game to France and get us on the front foot.” On the bench Lawrence is included, having not featured in a match-day squad since starting against Scotland on the opening day of the campaign. He will hope for more involvement as and when he comes on, having largely been a bystander in that disappointing defeat. Mako Vunipola and Kyle Sinckler continue as the props while Ben Youngs and George Ford are once again the half-backs. Owen Farrell stays at inside-centre with Henry Slade outside him, while Jonny May and Anthony Watson – who wins his 50th cap – are on the wings.

       "  'full_article': 'Here is a documentary about the resurgent interest in retro culture that comes across like a warm fuzzy blanket of nostalgia for pre-Covid days. The central figure is “Doc” Florian Kaps, who the film presents as Vienna’s answer to Steve Jobs, a social visionary untroubled by such details as earning a living or indeed running a functioning business. Kaps’ speciality is what he calls “analogue”: physical hardware such as manual switchboards, jukeboxes, printing presses, and the like, made obsolete by the rise of laptops and smartphones. At the start of the film, Kaps’ attention is caught by the failing Polaroid camera, and – seemingly on a whim – he agrees to take over the company’s last factory, in the Netherlands. (We are not told much about his finances, other than the occasional arrival of tech investor types who pop up whenever needed.) It soon becomes clear that Kaps’ visionary utterances (“What does Facebook smell like?”) are no match for a solid business plan, and after a few years of trying fruitlessly to replicate Polaroid’s instant film, Kaps is ejected from his own company when a former intern becomes CEO after bringing in his own investor father.    Kaps is not daunted after this cautionary experience, and applies his roving mind to, first, a cafe/gallery called Supersense, and later to hotel keeping; his tech contacts come in handy for the latter as he appears to get backing from Facebook’s Analog Research Lab to restart operations at a giant mothballed Overlook-type place called Sudbahnhotel. It’s never clear exactly what roles Kaps has in any of these activities, or how he earns money, but he is genial company and makes a persuasive case for life beyond the digital realm: making an astute observation that, where once analogue businesses tried to convert to digital, digital companies are now getting interested in the real world. Of course, this was all filmed pre-Covid, during which the power of digital technology has asserted itself like never before. It’s possible that Kaps’ enthusiasms may have foundered by the time the pandemic recedes. • An Impossible Project is released on 15 March on digital platforms.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'Stalled ships, stressed crews: Covid buying boom overwhelms LA ports',\n",
       "  'full_article': ' There were 48 ships laden with goods destined for store shelves across the United States sitting at anchor in southern California’s San Pedro Bay on Wednesday. In normal times, these massive cargo ships would have made their way from factories in China and other Asian nations directly to a dock at the ports of Los Angeles or Long Beach, the busiest seaport complex in the US. Today, they are spending an average of more than seven days sitting at anchor as dockworkers in southern California struggle to keep up with a surge in imports brought on by a pandemic-induced buying boom while parts of their workforce are recovering from the coronavirus. “We’re happy to keep working because that is what we do, we’re hard-working people,” Henry Pollard Jr, a tophandler driver who has spent the past 15 years working at the ports. “We just need more skilled labor to help unload all the cargo.” The backlog at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach – along with nearly every other port in the US – has been exacerbated by the spike in coronavirus cases in southern California tied to the holiday season. Of the 15,000 dockworkers at the two ports, about 800 have in recent weeks been infected with the coronavirus – a number representing just over 5% of the ports’ total workforce. Overall, the workforce at both ports has seen almost 1,000 coronavirus infections and reported at least 12 deaths tied to the pandemic. “We’re a full year into a global pandemic, and longshore workers have seen both record-breaking cargo imports and the heartbreaking deaths of our colleagues,” Mike Podue, president of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, Local 63, said on the union’s website. “These losses connect us all on an emotional, visceral level.” Following a concerted push from both port officials and union leaders to have longshoremen and warehouse workers classified as a priority group to receive the Covid-19 vaccine, California authorities agreed and allowed workers at the ports to begin to be inoculated starting on 12 February.    Shipping containers sit on a dock in Oakland, California. Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images   About 800 longshoremen were the first workers at the ports to receive shots of the Moderna vaccine at a clinic quickly organized by the Long Beach department of health and human services. Port officials said they were hopeful that with the recent approval by the US Food and Drug Administration of the Johnson & Johnson single-dose vaccine – along with the ramping up of production of both the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines – that the ports will be able to operate with a full workforce in the near future. “We’re not there yet, but it’s on everybody’s radar and we’re simply trying to highlight the inventory as it becomes available,” said Gene Seroka, the executive director of the port of Los Angeles. Seroka, however, cautioned that even having 100% of both longshoremen and dockworkers able to unload cargo would not solve the crisis caused by the surge of imports coming to US shores. “We have so much cargo that you need more than 100% to get the job done,” he said. It’s a dramatic turn from the first months of the pandemic, when the Chinese government issued its stay-at-home orders as Covid-19 began its global spread – a move that effectively shut down the manufacturing industry of the US’s largest supplier of imported goods. In 2019, Chinese imports to the US totaled $451.7bn, accounting for over 18% of all goods imported to the US, according to the Office of the United States Trade Representative. In the spring of 2020, the volume plunged. “In the first five months of the year, through May, our cargo volume was down 19% and the available work on the docks was about the same percentage,” Seroka said. “So truck drivers, the longshoremen, warehouse people – all those guys had less work opportunities.” Pollard, too, said things got a “little rough” during the first months of the pandemic. “You’ve got a family and you’ve got to take care of that family, so that was your major concern,” Pollard said. He added, however, that many dockworkers at the time assumed the downturn would be similar to the annual slowdown around the Lunar New Year. And while it lasted longer than that, it quickly made a swift change of course last summer as Americans began dishing out dollars normally spent on dinner and movie tickets on consumer goods. Despite the high unemployment figures and overall economic insecurity, people were spending money on everything from sneakers and handbags to home goods and new cars.    Container ships are docked at the port of Oakland. Photograph: John G Mabanglo/EPA   A US commerce department report from last summer found that consumer spending jumped 6.5% in June 2020 and another 1.9%in July. And those numbers continue to remain high, with the commerce department reporting that consumer spending increased the largest amount in seven months in January amid new pandemic relief money to low-income households and a drop in the number of new Covid-19 infections. The spike has left the ports in a precarious situation, said Tony Nuzio, the founder and CEO of ICC Logistics Services, a New York-based transportation and logistics consulting firm. On one end, manufacturers in Asia are churning out products to meet the growing demand in the US and quickly shipping their goods across the Pacific. In many instances, shipping lines are making the return journey to Asian ports with empty containers – a move that speeds up their return to Asia but has angered American farmers, who say they are both losing out on overseas sales and being hit with rising costs. In January, the number of empty containers leaving the port of Los Angeles for Asia increased 14.5% compared to January 2020. Ports are also dealing with problems on the domestic front, namely a lack of space. With longshoremen in southern California being inundated with record amounts of new cargo on a daily basis, warehouse workers are also struggling to find room to store the deluge of containers. There is nary a warehouse within 60 miles of the two ports that is not filled to capacity and, at both the port and in warehouses, the time it takes for trucks to haul them away has more than doubled compared to before the pandemic. At the port of Los Angeles, for example, containers are currently sitting at the dock for an average of five days, compared with around two days before the surge. In off-site warehouses, those times climb higher, with containers sitting for around eight days instead of the standard three and a half days. “More thought really should have been put into how people in this country get their products,” Nuzio said. “When this is over, maybe it’s time to pause and re-evaluate how we do things.” While the surge, and resulting backlog at US docks, has resulted in sleepless nights for port workers and executives trying to figure out how to unload all the cargo, it has raised fears for the financial viability of companies and the looming threat of soaring prices for consumers on both sides of the Pacific. Businesses in Asia worry that they won’t be able to secure the containers needed to ship their goods to the US, while their buyers stateside voice concerns that their shelves will remain empty. These scenarios are already playing out in US stores, where spot shortages of goods like household appliances and some clothing saw the cost of imported goods from China rise in December by 0.3%, the largest one-month gain in over three years. “It’s the law of supply and demand,” Nuzio said. “On the bright side, it looks like we’re getting to a solution. Are we out of the woods yet? No, but we’re getting there.” Seroka and other port officials across the US have said that while the surge will continue well into the second quarter of 2021, the availability of more vaccines paired with putting pressure on the retail and import communities to pick up their shipments as quickly as possible will help ease the pressure. In the meantime, southern California ports are also selectively metering out ships to other nearby ports in an attempt to stem the backlog. “It does not do the American supply chain any good if we just keep stacking up ships,” Seroka said. “So ships we can allow are going to other ports, but in very small, small percentages. He added: “It is allowing us some breadth and depth to catch up.” Seroka estimated that southern California’s ports will be able to clear up the backlog sometime my mid-summer, but warned that if the pileup of cargo is not resolved, there could be dire consequences when consumer spending ramps up even more for next winter’s holiday season. “We’ve got to be prepared for that because if we don’t get out of this and then the cargo takes another uptick, that’s going to spell a lot more complications than even this equation we’ve got going right now,” he said.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': \"Fishermen's wives: how unsung efforts keep a way of life afloat\",\n",
       "  'full_article': \"In spring 2020, the fishing community of Newport, Oregon, shuttered along with the rest of the country. A coronavirus outbreak at a local Pacific Seafood processing plant left fishermen sitting on docks with no buyers for their Dungeness crabs, while restaurants closed and families found themselves housebound. That’s when Taunette Dixon and her organization, the Newport Fishermen’s Wives, stepped in. This group quickly mobilized to provide food, supplies, infant formula, pet food, fuel cards, masks, gloves and money for past-due utility payments to fishing families who had been hit by the pandemic. For 50 years, groups like Dixon’s have formed the behind-the-scenes backbone of their communities, often lobbying on behalf of their husbands, who leave for months at a time to fish. In fishing towns where fishermen’s spouses stay onshore, fishermen’s wives associations have served as mutual aid groups, social support networks and political agitators. Dixon and her colleagues mend nets, keep books, care for families, fight for or against environmental regulations, navigate byzantine quota systems and act as onshore brokers communicating information to husbands out at sea. Data about these women is scarce, and there’s not much research quantifying exactly how much work they perform for the industry, but social scientists call their labor an “informal subsidy”. And yet, when policymakers talk about supporting fishermen, women like Dixon are often left out of the conversation. And at a local level, members of these groups say their individual efforts can go unnoticed or taken for granted.    Taunette Dixon, as president of the Newport Fishermen’s Wives, leads a meeting of women while holding her grandson Kainen Borden in Newport, Oregon. The organization supports their fishing community through scholarships, fundraising, and mutual aid programs. Photograph: Amanda Lucier/The Guardian   “In a fishing family like mine, I do the management. I do payroll, I make sure we have our permits, I fill out all the red tape,” said Dixon. “I don’t think it’s recognized generally how much work women do in the industry. It’s changing but it has a long way to go.” Some of these women receive payment for their administrative and organizing work by finding jobs at fishing-related non-profits or governmental agencies, while others don’t, and most are well-respected in their communities. But many say their organizations are still rankled by broader misconceptions about women in fishing and by casual misogyny. “If somebody calls about some aspect of what’s going on on the boat, they’re always asking for my husband when it’s myself who’s going to give the answer,” said Dixon, who is co-president of the Newport group.” [People need to] realize that women can make good decisions in the fishing industry.” ***   Related: 'We have no market, but lots of lobsters': a Maine lobsterwoman fights for her livelihood   Fishing has always been a harsh, addictive pursuit, and the fishing industry has always been singular: it involves making a profit off creatures that dwell in a public resource, and as such, it’s often both highly regulated and contentious – just this season, fishermen in Newport joined their counterparts up and down the west coast to strike in protest of low prices for Dungeness crab. These days, the industry finds itself at a crossroads: battling climate change, which has altered currents, expelled species from their traditional breeding grounds and acidified the ocean, and Covid-19, which caused the lucrative export market for fish to collapse last spring. While women do fish, especially in Alaska and on the west coast, there are plenty of reasons why women who marry fishermen or are born into fishing families may stay onshore. In some industries, such as lobstering, the exclusive licensing system favors the old boys’ club. In Massachusetts, the Italian and Portuguese immigrants who shaped the industry believed that women on boats brought bad luck. “Traditionally we’re in a man’s world,” said Renée Gagne, who once worked as a commercial fisherman, and now works as a shellfish constable in Massachusetts, a town-appointed job that entails monitoring clam diggers to ensure they’re sticking to regulations. “There’s limited participation of women in the actual fishing part of it.”    Heather Mann, the executive director of the Midwater Trawlers Cooperative talks with boat owners in Newport, Oregon, on 8 January. Photograph: Amanda Lucier/The Guardian   And yet when a woman marries a fisherman, his career often transforms her life. “Becoming a fisherman’s wife is almost like marrying into the military, without the kudos,” said Suzanne Russell, a social scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) in Seattle. Fishing becomes the organizing principle of their family life. Women who are born or marry into this world might support the family business by handling day-to-day tasks. “There’s a lot of grinding and scraping and painting of boats,” Amber Taunton, Dixon’s co-president, said one November afternoon, after just coming in from painting buoys. Others might take a governmental role like Gagne, work in a non-profit, design nets or run markets. But one of the most enduring ways in which women have supported the industry is through the fishermen’s wives groups. These organizations sometimes pop up to tackle a particular industry issue and then dissolve, but others remain in operation, gaining sway in their local community and becoming a force to be reckoned with. The Newport group, for example, started as a social club but transformed into a support and advocacy group for the local fishing economy. One example of their organizing was in 2014, when they successfully sued the Coast Guard over a plan to remove its search and rescue helicopter base from Newport, which the wives feared would imperil their seafaring husbands.

Photograph: Amanda Lucier/The Guardian   In Massachusetts, in another tight-knit fishing community, the Gloucester Fishermen’s Wives Association has taken on a political edge, shaping New England fishing since it was founded in 1969. The group’s current president, Angela Sanfilippo, emigrated from Sicily to Gloucester when she was young, and by 1977, she was married to a fisherman, with two children. That year saw the enactment by the UN of the 200-mile limit, which established an exclusive economic zone for US fishermen. The downside was that they started catching too much, flooding the market. Sanfilippo attended a meeting about this issue to translate for the fishermen, first-generation Italian immigrants, many of whom didn’t speak English, and found herself weighing in. Since then, she and her fellow wives have asserted themselves as key decision-makers in the local fishing economy. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, they first secured a one-year and then a 10-year moratorium on disruptive oil drilling on Georges Bank, fertile fishing grounds off the east coast. In 1993, they negotiated with environmental groups to preserve fishing rights in the Stellwagen marine sanctuary, crucial territory for Massachusetts fishermen. In 2008, they pioneered one of the nation’s first community-supported fishery boxes, Cape Ann Fresh Catch, to encourage consumers to eat different kinds of seafood. They opposed wind turbines on fishing grounds, facilitated safety training, erected a fishermen’s wives statue in their town. “We were shore captains,” said Sanfilippo. “We would make sure when the boats came in, they’d get everything they needed so they could go back out the next morning at 2.30. The wife would be responsible to make sure these things happened. As their wives, we knew more than them.” ***    Fishing vessels sit in port in Newport, Oregon. Photograph: Amanda Lucier/The Guardian   Overlooking women’s work has a long history, said sociologist Erin Hatton, who studies gender and labor at the University at Buffalo. She calls this the gender lens: work done by women is coded and perceived as unessential, not as real labor. One famous historical example, said Hatton, stems from the garment industry: women were considered to have nimble fingers, and so their aptitude with sewing was considered natural and biological, not skilled work that should be fairly compensated. Discourse around women’s so-called natural affinity for parenting and nurturing also falls into this category, said Hatton. Because the wives’ work focuses as much on individuals’ needs in their community as it does on the broader conditions of the fishing industry, their contributions to the local economy can similarly go overlooked. And yet it’s hard to describe the women’s work as anything other than essential. It seems women are the connective tissue of fishing communities: bringing together other workers with hard-to-access resources. If a fisherman needs a new trailer truck for his business and can’t afford it, he might come to them for help, said Nina Groppo, a colleague of Sanfilippo’s. When the pandemic hit, Sanfilippo said the wives helped families apply for unemployment and SBA loans and helped fishermen track down tariff relief funds that were owed to them, while their healthcare navigators helped fishermen parse the MassHealth system. Despite all this, fishermen’s wives groups are often left out of discussions at a policy level, especially at the state and federal level. “If we’re designing support for fishermen to help them through Covid, do we need to think in broader terms about who’s affected [in these economies] beyond just the fishermen themselves?” said Sarah Harper, a professor at the University of Victoria who studies the social dimensions of fishing communities. Policies like tariff relief payments, industry-specific Covid relief and compensatory programs for regions affected by oil spills may assist fishermen who find themselves struggling – but if women back home are organizing among themselves to help prop up the industry, who is looking out for them? “The implications of that oversight are quite significant. We have to consider all the people involved,” said Harper. Asked what can be done to garner more recognition for fishermen’s wives, Hatton said she thinks these women are already on the right track. The fishermen’s wives groups, she said, “are taking up space and asserting that they deserve recognition for their work. It sounds like they’re doing part of that work of taking off the gendered lens that obscures our vision about what work is, and who does it.” As Nina Groppo said, “Now fishermen’s wives are almost an icon.”\\n\",\n",

       "  'title': 'Queen and David Bowie recorded Cream covers in Under Pressure sessions',\n",
       "  'full_article': \"A new interview with Brian May and Roger Taylor reveals there are further unreleased recordings made by David Bowie and Queen during the sessions that produced Under Pressure. In summer 1981, Queen were recording in Switzerland. Bowie, then a tax exile in the country, popped in to pick their brains about record advances while he searched for a new label. His visit turned into a boozy jam session in which the glam stars tooled around playing “all sorts of old songs … whatever came into our head”, said Roger Taylor. They eventually worked up Under Pressure – released in October 1981, it became Queen’s second UK No 1 (after Bohemian Rhapsody) and Bowie’s third.    The cover of Record Collector Presents … Queen. Photograph: -   A new conversation with Taylor and Brian May in a special one-shot edition of Record Collector dedicated to Queen reveals that further recordings exist from those sessions, including covers of songs by Cream. “If we look to the archives, yeah, there’s probably stuff,” says Taylor. “We would do the odd thing like covering old Cream songs. I remember we did NSU and I Feel Free, just for a laugh really, and then we decided, ‘Let’s write one for ourselves.’” The interview makes no mention of whether the recordings will ever be issued in the future. Smile, the pre-Mercury incarnation of Queen, had previously covered I Feel Free. Bowie and the Spiders from Mars included the 1966 Cream hit – the group’s second single, which reached No 11 – in encores to their shows in the early 70s, where it played the role of “crowdpleaser”, wrote Ashes to Ashes author Chris O’Leary. “A hit song in a set mainly consisting of unreleased material”. “We didn’t do it very well,” Bowie later said of those performances, a perception that prompted him to record a version with Mick Ronson on his 1993 album Black Tie White Noise. The song had a personal resonance, Bowie told NME that year.   Queen and David Bowie: Under Pressure – video  He recalled seeing the group in Bromley with his half-brother, the late Terry Burns, who had been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. The brothers had to leave the gig because Burns “started feeling very, very bad … He used to see visions a lot.” Outside, said Bowie, Burns “collapsed on the ground and he said the ground was opening up and there was fire and stuff pouring out the pavement, and I could almost see it for him, because he was explaining it so articulately.” Burns died by suicide in 1985. Despite its stature, Under Pressure was not promoted by Queen or Bowie – “The single sleeve had no photographs, its video was cobbled together by David Mallett from stock footage,” O’Leary wrote in Ashes to Ashes – and they never performed the song together, even at Live Aid where they both appeared. Though a staple of Queen’s setlists, Bowie did not perform it live until the 1992 memorial concert for Mercury, as a duet with Annie Lennox and the surviving members of Queen.   Related: David Bowie's 50 greatest songs – ranked!   Speaking to Record Collector, May recalled that the Queen song I Go Crazy (released on the B-side to Radio Ga Ga in 1984) was also developed in the Swiss sessions, though the final recording – which does not credit Bowie – was “very different to the version that we started off when David was around”. Once Queen unearthed an instrumental then titled Feel Like, complemented by Bowie trying ideas out on the piano, Under Pressure was born. “That became very much the priority,” said May. “So there are only little sketches apart from that.” There is, however, also the infamous version of Cool Cat that Bowie attempted to suppress. A Queen-only version of the song appeared on their 1982 album Hot Space, but the original was, inevitably, leaked – and panned. • Record Collector Presents … Queen is available in shops and to order now.\\n\",\n",

       "  'title': 'Gab: hack gives unprecedented look into platform used by far right',\n",
       "  'full_article': \"A data breach at the fringe social media site Gab has for the first time offered a picture of the user base and inner workings of a platform that has been opaque about its operation. The breach, news of which first emerged in late February, allowed hackers to extract Gab databases that appear to show user accounts and a history of public posts and direct messages. The user lists appear to mark 500 accounts, including neo-Nazis, QAnon influencers, cryptocurrency advocates and conspiracy theorists, as investors. They also appear to give an overview of verified users of the platform, including prominent rightwing commentators and activists. And they mark hundreds of active users on the site as “automated”, appearing to indicate administrators knew the accounts were bots but let them continue on the platform regardless. Finally, the data appears to contain direct messages between the Gab CEO, Andrew Torba, and a user who has been identified as a high-profile QAnon influencer, showing the entrepreneur seeking direct feedback on site design from a member of a group that promotes a “spiderweb of rightwing internet conspiracy theories with antisemitic and anti-LGBTQ elements”, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center.   Related: Rightwing 'super-spreader': study finds handful of accounts spread bulk of election misinformation   The breach was the first of two hacks targeting Gab in recent weeks. On Monday, the platform went dark after a hacker took over the accounts of 178 users, including Torba and the Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene. In messages sent from the pirated accounts, the hackers claimed they had obtained 831 “verification documents” from the site and asked for Bitcoins in exchange for returning them. High-profile users spew hate Gab, a Twitter-like website promoted by Torba as a bastion of free speech, has long been a forum of last resort for extremists and conspiracy theorists who have been banned on other online platforms. It attained worldwide notoriety in 2018 when a user, Robert Bowers, wrote on the site that he was “going in”, shortly before allegedly entering the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and killing 11 people.    People hug on the sidewalk outside the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh on 27 October, the second anniversary of the shooting. Photograph: Gene J Puskar/AP   News of the initial breach was first reported by Wired magazine on 28 February, after reports about it had been circulating online. The data was not publicly released, but was offered selectively to reporters and activists by the transparency organization Distributed Denial of Secrets. Torba acknowledged the vulnerability and the breach in a statement released following the leak but did not comment on the authenticity of the data or particular content. He did not respond to the Guardian’s request for comment on its content. The leaked files contained what appears to be a database of over 4.1 million registered users on the site and tags identifying subscribers as “investors”, “verified” users and “pro” users. Gab investors contributed in one of three share offerings and one convertible note, a form of short-term debt that converts into equity, according to its financial reporting. The 2017 share offering, for example, required a minimum investment of $199.10, and rewarded investors who contributed a greater amount with “perks”. Users who invested $200 could display a “Gab investor badge” on the site. The badges corresponded with a tag in the database, which allowed investors to be looked at in detail. Some of the people associated with investors’ accounts had high-profile jobs and public roles, while spewing hate and extremist beliefs online. Among the accounts labeled as an investor is a user named “Manwe Sulimo”, who presents themselves in their user bio as a “former NASA Engineer turned Flat-earther”. The account is littered with posts and reposts of antisemitic, transphobic and pro-Nazi material. At one point the user expressed the opinion that “Jews are Satan’s chosen people”. In their profile, they link to several videos, including a notorious pro-Hitler documentary series.   Related: US far-right extremists making millions via social media and cryptocurrency   The University of Michigan email attached to that account belongs to Shane Moore, a 33-year-old resident of Lake Orion, Michigan. While there is no evidence that Moore worked directly with Nasa, papers he co-authored confirm the claims made on his LinkedIn profile that he worked on aspects of NanoFet, an experimental high-speed spacecraft engine, while an engineering student at the University of Michigan. His LinkedIn profile also says that he is currently a thermal simulation engineer at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles in Auburn Hills, Michigan. Neither Moore nor Fiat Chrysler returned requests for comment. BiglySpeaks is another account tagged as belonging to an investor. The bio for the account carries hashtags indicating a promotion of Holocaust and coronavirus denial, apparent beliefs that are also reflected in the account’s antisemitic and conspiracy-minded posts. The email address attached to the account belongs to Steven Reid, a former Republican party activist and conservative political blogger in Provo, Utah. In 2011, Reid unsuccessfully ran for secretary of the Utah county Republican party. His now dormant blog, Nacilbupera, was widely cited as a source of information on conservative politics in that state. Reid did not respond to a request for comment. ‘Pro’ users, verified users and bots The data breach also appears to offer some insight into users tagged as “verified” by Gab, which according to the platform’s own explanation means that they have completed a verification process that includes matching their display name to a government ID. Verified users whose email addresses appear to have been exposed in the leak range from longtime political operatives, such as Roger Stone, to far-right political commentators including Michelle Malkin and Peter Brimelow, editor of VDare, and far-right activists such as Nick Fuentes and Jared Taylor, who heads the white nationalist organization American Renaissance. And it appears to include a list of users registered as “pros”, which allows users to access additional features and a badge at a price starting at $99 year. The database indicates over 18,000 users had paid to be pro users at the time of the breach. Nearly 4,000 users were flagged as donors to Gab’s repeated attempts to attract voluntary gifts from users. More than 770 registered accounts on the platform, including some active ones, appear to be marked in the service’s own database as bots. The Guardian emailed all of the verified users named above for comment on the breach, but none immediately responded except for Jared Taylor, who wrote in an email: “This hacking operation was a federal crime, but don’t expect the Biden administration to care.” Direct messages included in the leak appear to show close communication between Torba and a major QAnon influencer who is labeled a Gab investor, seemingly reinforcing the CEO’s public efforts to make Gab a home for adherents to the QAnon conspiracy theory, which helped fuel the 6 January attack on the nation’s Capitol.    Torba publicly sought to make Gab a home for believers in the QAnon movement, which helped fuel the Capitol attack. Photograph: Shannon Stapleton/Reuters   In the messages, Torba and the user Neon Revolt, who has been identified as Richard Cornero Jr, a QAnon influencer, discuss the direct messaging feature, then relatively new on the platform. The messages suggest a close relationship between Gab’s CEO and one of the key proponents of a baseless conspiracy theory whose adherents have held, among other things, that Donald Trump was on a secret mission to expose and imprison members of a pedophile ring that included celebrities and high-ranking Democratic politicians. Cornero did not respond to a request for comment. ‘Negligent or malicious’ about security According to Wired, the data exposed in the apparent hack was sourced by a hacker who had found a security vulnerability in the site. Eugen Rochko, the developer of a source codebase named Mastodon that was used by Gab as a basis for its website from early 2019 over Rochko’s objections, believes poor security practices played a significant part in the breach. Rochko said in an email that Gab adopted Mastodon’s codebase “as a way of circumventing Google’s and Apple’s ban on [Gab’s smartphone app] from their app stores”, but that Gab then removed features that show total numbers of users and active users, and ultimately severed ties with Mastodon’s ongoing development process.. In doing this, Gab’s programmers introduced two serious security vulnerabilities into its code, according to Rochko, one of which was publicized by another programmer in early February. Rochko says that Gab did little to address these “obvious” problems, adding: “I’m not aware of them ever adopting our bug fixes, including important security fixes.”   Related: US militia group draws members from military and police, website leak shows   Megan Squire, a professor of computer science at Elon University and longtime researcher on the far right’s use of internet technologies said the vulnerabilities Gab introduced in its codebase were “basic, basic stuff”. “Gab was negligent at best and malicious at worst” in its approach to security, she added. “It is hard to envision a scenario where a company cared less about user data than this one.” Of this week’s hack, Torba said in a post on the site that the hacker had taken advantage of Gab’s failure to clear user authorization tokens following the initial attack, but that Gab had “not independently verified the information that the hacker posted”. Squire added that her comments “still apply” after this latest breach. Gab’s chief technology officer, Fosco Marotto, did not respond directly to questions about Gab’s approach to security, writing in an email of the hack: “Our investigation is continuing and we will have more to say on this matter when it has concluded.” Torba himself initiated communication with the Guardian after it had started contacting users identified in the data breach. Torba sent an empty email with the subject line, “Deuteronomy 28:7”, a Bible verse promising victory over enemies. He did not respond to a return email with questions about his security practices but used his own website to condemn “journos” and other perceived enemies.  This article was amended on 11 March 2021.

       "  'title': \"Meet the 'faux commuters' taking fake trips to work during the pandemic \",\n",
       "  'full_article': 'At the outset of the Covid-19 pandemic, some workers found themselves at home, momentarily (at least they thought) liberated from the many impositions of office work – including commuting. Now, instead of waking up early, getting dressed and schlepping to the office and back, people had time to do anything they want. Which is why it might be surprising that some are still pretending to commute.   Related: Out of office: what the homeworking revolution means for our cities   “When I [started] working from home, I had this gap in my day. At first I was like, ‘Wow, like I have a lot more time, I can sleep in!’ But there are a lot of aspects of the commute I just was missing,” says Kerri Jesson, a digital marketing associate in Vancouver, British Columbia. Before the pandemic, Jesson had planned her day while on public transit – going over her to-do list, checking her calendar, and getting ready to transition into work mode. “I didn’t even really realize that I was prepping myself for the day until I no longer had the ability to do that,” she says. In an effort to regain the satisfying elements of her former routine, Jesson began faux commuting several months ago. Now, she drives about 20 minutes to a coffee shop most mornings, before her workday starts. Not only does Jesson’s commute create a buffer between her work and personal time, but it “adds that more human aspect” back into her day.   When you’re commuting, there’s hundreds of people around you, so it’s kind of like everyone’s in it together  Kerri Jesson    “When you’re commuting, there’s hundreds of people around you, so it’s kind of like everyone’s in it together,” she says. Jesson is clearly not the only one craving this sort of downtime. Microsoft has tried to recreate the benefits lost from commuting by creating a “virtual commute”, giving employees time to set goals in the morning, and reflect back on the workday at its end – with an optional short guided meditation to round everything off. John Dorsey, an attorney in Washington DC, had been cycling 40-odd minutes to work and back every day for 20 years when the pandemic hit. For him, cycling was a way to avoid heinous city traffic while exercising, or to listen to the occasional HG Wells audiobook. Dorsey’s last day working in an office was a Friday, and the following Monday he was already back out there on his “circular commute”, a 15-mile morning ride through Rock Creek Park that’s become a favorite pastime. “It’s an hour where I don’t really need to talk to anybody, I’m just sort of away,” he says. But with winter’s freezing temperatures, you would think some cyclists might appreciate a break from their morning commute. Apparently not, for cyclist Louis Philippe, a business analyst in Mississauga, Ontario, who has continued cycling to work through winter, but from the comfort of his own home. Philippe appreciates the meditative qualities of a morning “fake commute” cycle – but  swapped out the rush of wind in his hair and got his adrenaline pumping from November onwards using a stationary bike in his basement. “As soon as it starts getting dark early and we change the clocks I have trouble getting up to [bike outside] early in the morning,” he explains. Studies support the fact that commutes offer the benefit of creating psychologically useful transition periods between work and home life. Consciously signaling to the brain and body it’s time to stop working is especially important when we’re working from home: a recent study of 3.1 million people by the National Bureau of Economic Research determined that following lockdown orders, remote workers stayed on the job almost 50 minutes longer every day than they did while in office, a trend which could exacerbate burnout. Before the pandemic, when commuting was obligatory, its healthy, boundary-creating elements may have felt like a meager silver lining around a dark cloud of drudgery and stress to many. Now, faux commuters can journey on their own terms, choosing where to go – like a park instead of gridlocked traffic; they can choose their mode of transportation – like a nice walk rather than a dark subway ride; and how long they want to “commute” for – perhaps just in the morning, afternoon, or both.   [The faux commute] is super vital for optimizing sleep quality and the capacity to fall asleep easily at night  Jessica Eastman    Jessica Eastman, a naturopathic doctor and a faux commuter herself, even believes a commute can be the secret to a high-quality sleep – something many have found harder to get during the pandemic. Now, Eastman prescribes morning and after-work walks to her clients to help them clear their minds and get better rest. “People are having a really hard time falling asleep at the end of the day after working remotely,” she says, explaining how time blurs together without clear slots for things like lunch, start time and finish time. Without the time to process and clear information, she says we end up finally doing it at the end of the day, when we lie down to sleep – keeping us up at night. “Not only is [the faux commute] really vital for helping to regulate mood, energy and focus for the day, it’s also super vital for optimizing sleep quality and the capacity to fall asleep with ease in the evening.” At the very least, faux commuting is as good a reason as any to get out of the house. • This story was amended on 12 March 2021.

       "  'title': 'Boost for Biden as Covid aid bill passes | First Thing',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Good morning Congress passed a landmark $1.9tn coronavirus aid bill on Wednesday, marking the first major legislative victory for Biden and his administration, and breathing life into one of the largest emergency packages in US history. Falling along party lines, the House of Representatives voted 220 to 211 for the bill, with Democrats erupting into applause as the result was announced. As news broke, Biden tweeted that “help is here”; he will sign the bill into law on Friday. The bill promises to support millions of Americans as they cope with the economic fallout of the pandemic, which has caused mass job losses and pushed many into poverty. It was the result of an aggressive campaign by the White House to push through the bill at its current price tag, amid continued efforts from Republicans to water it down. However, it isn’t all good news for Biden; despite his pledges of unity, the president failing to win over a single Republican.      So what’s in the bill? As many as 85% of US households will be eligible for direct payments of $1,400 a person, unemployment benefits will be extended and child tax credit expanded, alongside a number of measures around vaccines, local government and health insurance subsidies to target the pandemic. Read our explainer about what the bill contains. The bill could cut the number of Americans living in poverty by a third, and reduce child poverty in the US by nearly half, writes Washington DC bureau chief, David Smith, in his analysis of today’s big story. The bill marks an end to Reagan-style economic policies and embraces the projects of Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson, championing investment and reform, he writes.  Andrew Cuomo is facing his most serious allegation yet    “As I said yesterday, I have never done anything like this. The details of this report are gut-wrenching,” Cuomo said through a spokesperson on Wednesday evening. Photograph: Seth Wenig/AP   An aide to New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, has accused him of groping her, the sixth and most serious allegation of sexual harassment made by women so far. According to the a report in the Times Union of Albany, the woman, who was not named, was summoned by Cuomo to help with his cellphone, and was alone with the governor when he closed the door, reached under her shirt and groped her breast. The paper cited an unidentified source with direct knowledge of the woman’s claim. Cuomo faces harassment allegations from five other women. The 25-year-old’s attorney, Debra Katz, said in a statement released on Wednesday evening that the latest allegations are “eerily similar” to the claims of former aide Charlotte Bennett, who says she was summoned to the Capitol on a weekend purportedly for cellphone help, before Cuomo asked about her sex life and propositioned her. The three-term governor has denied any inappropriate touching, but apologised if he made anyone uncomfortable. Merrick Garland has been confirmed as attorney general    Leading Republican Mitch McConnell expressed his support for Garland, commending ‘his long reputation as a straight shooter and a legal expert’. Photograph: Reuters   The US Senate approved Merrick Garland as the country’s most senior law enforcement official with a 70-30 vote on Wednesday. Supporters hailed the moment as a turning point in the management of the criminal justice system, marking an end to Trump’s “law and order” narrative and alleged politicisation of the justice department. It’s not the first time Garland has been close to judicial leadership; he was nominated to the supreme court by Barack Obama in 2016, but Senate Republicans denied him a hearing on the basis that it was an election year.  After Donald Trump spent four years … subverting the powers of the justice department for his own political benefit, treating the attorney general like his own personal defence lawyer, America can breathe a sigh of relief that we’re going to have someone like Merrick Garland leading the justice department,” said majority leader, Chuck Schumer, ahead of the vote. “Someone with integrity, independence, respect for the rule of law and credibility on both sides of the aisle.”  Two other Biden candidates were also confirmed, with Marcia Fudge approved as head of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Fudge, who is the first Black woman to run the department in decades, is a veteran lawmaker. Meanwhile, Michael Regan was confirmed as the first black man to head up the Environmental Protection Agency; he has served as North Carolina’s top environmental regulator for four years.

       "  'full_article': 'The BBC has appointed its media editor, Amol Rajan, as a new presenter on the Today programme. Rajan will become the flagship Radio 4 news show’s fifth presenter, alongside Justin Webb, Mishal Husain, Martha Kearney and Nick Robinson. He will also host a new interview series for BBC Two and a two-part documentary about Prince William and Prince Harry’s relationship with the media. The former editor of the Independent will continue in his existing role alongside his appointment to one of the highest-profile news jobs at the corporation. But he will step back from Radio 4’s The Media Show. Rajan said on Twitter that he was “enormously humbled and thrilled to join the presenting line-up on @BBCr4today, alongside a team of greats on and off air … Will try to do everyone proud.” In a statement released by the BBC he said: “I’ve no intention of trying to reinvent news, and think the best thing is to keep it simple. Be fair, get to the truth, and don’t screw up.” Owenna Griffiths, appointed as editor of the programme last summer after the departure of Sarah Sands, tweeted that the appointment was “brilliant news”. The BBC director of news, Fran Unsworth, said: “Amol conducts interviews with sharpness and grace, and I’m delighted we’ll be able to showcase that to the widest possible audience across BBC Two and the Today programme.” The Today programme attracts more than 7 million listeners each week, according to figures released last March before audience data collection was suspended because of the coronavirus pandemic.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': \"Violence against women an 'epidemic' that needs more resources, says Labour\",\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Violence against women is an epidemic which requires far more attention and resources, Labour’s shadow minister for domestic violence, Jess Phillips, has said, in the wake of the disappearance of Sarah Everard, who police believe may have been abducted as she walked home in south London. Phillips, who will speak at parliament’s International Women’s Day debate on Thursday when she will read out the names of all the women murdered by men in the past year, said it was untrue to say that the killing of women was rare.  Speaking on Radio 4’s Today programme, Phillips said random attacks on the street were a “rarity, if that is what this was”, but added: “The reality is that it’s not a rare crime. Since last week since when Sarah first went missing, six women and a little girl have been have been reported as being killed at the hands of men. “So it’s not particularly rare and the fear that women live with is an everyday thing. For most women they have had some form of experience that they feel frightened of and the message that they should be sending out is not one about what women should or shouldn’t do. “It is about how serious violence against women and girls is and how it is an epidemic that we have to put far more attention and resource into.” On Wednesday night, the Metropolitan police commissioner, Dame Cressida Dick, announced that police had discovered human remains in woodland in Kent during the search for Everard, a 33-year-old marketing executive. The remains have not yet been identified. A serving police officer has been arrested on suspicion of Everard’s murder. Seeking to reassure the public, the Met commissioner said: “I know Londoners will want to know that it is thankfully incredibly rare for a woman to be abducted from our streets. I completely understand that despite this, women in London and the wider public – particularly those in the area where Sarah went missing – will be worried and may well be feeling scared.” PC Wayne Couzens, 48, was arrested on Tuesday at his home in Deal, Kent, on suspicion of kidnapping Everard, who vanished after leaving a friend’s house at around 9pm on 3 March and beginning a 50-minute walk home. Mandu Reid, the leader of the British Women’s Equality party, has said the Met should not oversee the case, given the arrest of a serving officer. She said: “This case has affected women right across the capital and across the country but I cannot begin to imagine the pain that Sarah’s friends and family are going through. “The fact that a police officer has been arrested on suspicion of murder makes it all the more frightening, and it is imperative that the case is now taken over by a separate police force. We have to do this right.” London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, said: “I know how shocked and worried Londoners are by Sarah’s disappearance and the developments in the case. “I want to assure Sarah’s family, and everyone in our city, that the police are doing absolutely everything they can … Londoners will continue to see more police officers on our streets continuing their investigation and carrying out reassurance patrols in the area where Sarah went missing a week ago.” The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, called the case “devastating” and added: “Women should be able to walk home without fear or threat.” The case has prompted many women to share experiences of being threatened or harassed by men as they walked home. Phillips said she was a “tough cookie” but said that “when I was a teenager a man pulled up next to me and exposed himself to me”. “It’s got absolutely nothing to do with anything I can do. I can’t change the chromosomes in my body … I’m not stereotyping women as weak, I’m not even stereotyping men as all being perpetrators. “I am saying that the message that needs to be sent, is that male violence is something that has to be tackled and challenged – and the justice system and society has to wake up to that, because at the moment we just simply don’t take it as seriously as we take other crimes.”\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'Hong Kong activists urge EU not to ratify new deal with China',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Hong Kong democracy activists have warned the EU it must not ratify its planned new investment deal with China at a time when Beijing is tearing up international obligations to the people of Hong Kong. The 24 activists – including 13 in exile – have written to the EU commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, to call for the EU to refuse to sign the treaty until China’s national security laws are repealed and restrictions on who can stand for election are lifted. The letter comes as the EU prepares to try to sell its deal reached at the end of last year in the face of intense scepticism inside the European parliament. MEPs must ratify the deal before it can come into force. That task will not be made any easier by China’s National People’s Congress voting unanimously bar one abstention overnight to back changes to Hong Kong electoral laws to ensure only patriots can stand. The US has expressed its regret at the EU decision, and the Hong Kong exiles claim the EU is both being naive in trusting China’s commitments on labour rights and letting down those prepared to fight against authoritarianism by backing the deal. The activists write: “Given that Beijing is in the process of rewriting Hong Kong’s electoral system in direct contravention to its international obligations under the Sino-British Joint Declaration, is currently undertaking mass arrests and trials of pro-democracy lawmakers and activists under the draconian National Security Law, and is infringing on basic freedoms guaranteed both under the Basic Law and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, we do not see how the EU can move ahead with ratification of this investment treaty.” The letter, facilitated by Hong Kong Watch, is co-signed by leading activists including Ted Hui, Lam Wing-kee, Brian Leung, Nathan Law, Joe Tay, Ray Wong, Glacier Kwong, Finn Lau, Simon Cheng and Joey Siu. It adds: “It is simply absurd for the EU to expect China to uphold its obligations under a new bilateral investment treaty, when it is openly floating its current obligations to the international community to guarantee the autonomy and freedoms of the people of Hong Kong.” The letter is likely to be powerful ammunition for the large group of MEPs who are determined to resist the investment treaty. They warn that if European leaders show no moral backbone and instead sign the treaty they will be sending a signal to China that there are no red lines, including over the future of Taiwan. The activists argue that the EU will never have greater leverage over China than now, and it is not good enough simply to rely on China’s promises to make endeavours to sign up to ILO commitments to avoid the use enforced labour Ted Hui, a former democratic lawmaker from Hong Kong, now in Australia, said: “Members of the European parliament, European leaders, and EU commissioners must search their conscience, and ask whether the last few weeks of oppression in Hong Kong will continue if they push ahead with the ratification of the EU-China investment partnership?” Joey Siu, a Hong Kong activist in exile and associate of Hong Kong Watch, said: “The timing of CAI, months after the National Security Law was passed, sent a dreadful diplomatic message. It sent a message to Beijing that the EU would not sacrifice trading interests, no matter how they act, and communicated to Hongkongers that the EU is indifferent to our struggle to freedom.” Ray Wong, the first refugee from Hong Kong to receive asylum in Germany, said: “In Hong Kong, we have experienced first-hand that the CCP is not willing to keep its word. While the Australians are being punished with tariffs for taking a stand for democracy, the EU is ploughing ahead with CAI. The deal will weaken the bloc’s ability to take a principled stand in solidarity with Hong Kong’s people, and Uighurs facing oppression.” Many MEPs say the EU is in a totally compromised position since it is advocating closer economic ties with China at the same time as it is issuing statements condemning the changes to electoral law and vowing to be ready to take additional steps. The commission says the deal, years in the making, improves market access for EU companies, protects intellectual property and provides levers to make demands on human rights. They argue it is unrealistic for the EU to decouple from China economically, and if engagement is the only option, it is best to compete on more equal terms than China allows at present.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': \"How to access one of the 800,000 cheap flights in Australia's tourism bailout package\",\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Australians will be able to access half-priced flights to a handful of regional tourist destinations after the government announced it would subsidise certain routes as part of a $1.2bn support package for the tourism sector ravaged by state and international border closures. While the prime minister, Scott Morrison, labelled the airfare initiative – which includes subsidising 800,000 domestic airfares – a “ticket to recovery”, tourism and hospitality leaders have criticised the package for only targeting aviation businesses. They have warned it won’t do enough to save jobs after the jobseeker wage subsidy is cut off at the end of March. Qantas and Virgin Australia have praised the cheap flights but there are concerns the benefits of incentivising Australians to spend on domestic travel will hinge on states keeping their borders open even if Covid cases emerge. Climate activists are also worried about the impact on Australia’s emissions. When are the cheap fares available? The half-price fares will be available to book from 1 April until the end of July. It’s not clear when the first flight with half-price tickets will take off, but Qantas has indicated its fares will begin from 1 May. The government discount includes flights until the end of December. Where can I go? The government has nominated an initial list of 13 destinations, but said more destinations could be added. They are all for interstate travel with the exception of the route from Adelaide to Kangaroo Island.    Thirteen Australian locations are eligible for subsidised half-price flights as part of the government’s push to boost regional tourism. Photograph: The Guardian   Half-price return fares will be offered to the following destinations from the below capital cities: Sydney: flights to the Gold Coast, Cairns, Proserpine, Hamilton Island, Maroochydore, Uluru, Alice Springs, Launceston, Broome and Avalon. Melbourne: flights to the Gold Coast, Cairns, Maroochydore, Alice Springs, Uluru, Launceston, Devonport, Burnie, Broome and Merimbula. Adelaide: flights to the Gold Coast, Maroochydore, Alice Springs and Kangaroo Island. Brisbane: flights to Alice Springs, Uluru and Launceston. Darwin: flights to Cairns and Broome. Perth: flights to Alice Springs. Avalon: flights to the Gold Coast. Which airlines’ flights will be half price? Qantas and Jetstar expect to provide the bulk of the cheaper flights, with plans to offer 32,000 of the half-price fares per week. Virgin Australia has also welcomed the initiative and will provide a smaller amount.   Related: Domestic bliss: Australian destinations that feel like an overseas holiday   Regional airlines, including Rex, will be eligible for the routes, so long as they have been operating the route for the past two years. How do we know the airlines won’t increase their flight costs now? The amount of subsidy the government pays for airlines to halve their airfares will be based on the average fares charged in February. The deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, said he had held “long discussions” with Qantas and Virgin and had received assurances they would not artificially raise their prices before the discount offers came into effect. However the government has not announced a mechanism to monitor and enforce this. Can I book through a travel agent? While the details of the package are yet to be finalised, Graham Turner, Flight Centre founder and chief executive, told the Guardian that airlines had indicated to him that they intended to distribute the flights among travel agents, and would not require bookings to be made directly on their websites. How do I know states won’t suddenly close their borders again if there’s a Covid outbreak? There’s no guarantee states will remain open to interstate travellers if there is an outbreak of Covid-19, as much as the federal government would like states to reassure travellers. The federal tourism minister, Dan Tehan, told 6PR radio the threat of snap border closures was the biggest obstacle for potential travellers. “One of the things we’re really looking for … is a firm message from state and territory leaders that border closures will now be used as a last resort.” But when the Queensland treasurer, Cameron Dick, was asked about it on ABC radio on Thursday morning, he reiterated that his state would “act on the health advice”. On the plus side, airlines now have a well-established process for issuing vouchers or refunds for flights cancelled due to coronavirus-related disruptions. What’s the point of all these cheap flights?  Responding to tourism sector calls for ongoing support after jobkeeper payments end, the government hopes the package will encourage Australians to travel to tourist destinations that have previously relied on international tourism.   Related: Going anywhere: Australian mystery holidays are back from the 1990s   However many in the sector are sceptical this package can fill the void the ongoing international border closure has created, and that jobs that had relied on jobkeeper will be lost once the subsidy ends. There are also concerns the package, which also includes loan initiatives separate to the flight discounts, mostly help the aviation sector while hotels and tourism businesses in capital cities benefit less. Labor has also questioned why the majority of the initial 13 destinations that benefit from the package are located in marginal seats while neighbouring areas miss out. The Queensland state government has criticised the package’s lack of incentive for travel within states. What about the increased emissions? Richie Merzian, the climate and energy program director at the Australia Institute, warns that while the policy will benefit airlines it will also have “a noticeable impact” on Australia’s climate emissions. Merzian said domestic aviation accounted for a significant portion of the country’s transport emissions in a normal year. While there was a significant fall during the pandemic, overall transport emissions had already rebounded, thanks in large part to increased road travel. Offering the subsidy to airlines could “potentially tip it further in the opposite direction”, Merzian said. “The impact of this will be substantial and we will be able to see the impact of these flights in terms of the national emissions. This is basically an aviation fuel recovery package.” He was critical of the government for not attaching emissions reduction conditions to the package as some European countries had done when airlines were given bailouts. “As part of the deal they could have made Qantas and Virgin agree to offset the flights which would have created demand for offset projects and stimulated regional economies,” Merzian said. Previously, environmental campaigners in Australia condemned the rise of scenic “joy flights” aimed at passengers “missing the excitement of travel”. - additional reporting by Michael McGowan\\n',\n",

       "  'full_article': \"Rob James, an amateur jockey who was seen sitting on a dead horse in a video which circulated on social media last week, has had his rider’s licence suspended for a year with the final eight months suspended after a hearing before the Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board’s Referrals Committee on Wednesday. James, who rode Gordon Elliott’s Native Milan to win the Fulke Walwyn Kim Muir Handicap Chase at the Cheltenham Festival last year, has also agreed not to attend any race or point-to-point meeting during the four months in which his licence is suspended.   Related: Talking Horses: Denise Foster takes reins as Galvin leaves Elliott yard   The video of James, briefly sitting on a horse that had suffered a heart attack on a gallop in 2016, emerged three days after a similar image of Elliott started to circulate on social media last week. James subsequently apologised for his actions, saying he was “heartbroken by the damage” which the video had caused. The detailed decision of the panel, read out by Ms Justice Leonie Reynolds at the end of the case, will be published on Thursday. Earlier, the IHRB said Elliott’s agreement not to attend a racecourse for six months is the only condition attached either to the trainer’s penalty, which was imposed last week, or to the licence of Denise Foster, who took charge of his Cullentra House stable in County Meath on Tuesday when Elliott started his six-month suspension. The news from Ireland will increase pressure on the British Horseracing Authority to address concerns that Elliott could retain a significant role in the training operation, and do so before the Cheltenham Festival next week when Foster will have a strong team of horses in action. “As per rule 148(i),” Niall Cronin, the IRHB’s communications manager, said on Wednesday, “the licensed trainer of a horse shall be responsible for everything connected with the welfare, training and running of all horses under their care and shall be liable to any sanction available … unless the trainer provides a satisfactory explanation. “In addition to this, it was noted by Justice Groarke [the chair of Elliott’s disciplinary panel] on Friday that Gordon Elliott will not attend any race meeting or point-to-point for six months. There are no further conditions on the suspension of Mr Elliott or the licence of Mrs Foster. We have nothing further to add on this matter.” The absence of any additional conditions on Foster’s licence suggests Elliott, who lives at a yard which houses around 300 horses and employs about 50 staff, could retain a close role in the day-to-day operation of the yard. That, in turn, will turn the focus back to the BHA, whose chief executive, Julie Harrington, said earlier on Wednesday that the authority was “currently seeking clarification of what conditions have been put in place”.   Related: Damage of Gordon Elliott's 'moment of madness' will take years to erase   Asked to expand on the BHA’s approach to the issue, Harrington said: “I’m asking for those conditions but also making it clear what our views are, on behalf of JCR [Jockey Club Racecourses, which owns Cheltenham] as well, because we want to make sure that any horses that are attending are clearly not under the Gordon Elliott flag. “I’ve made our views on it clear, I’m waiting to hear what conditions will be applied to Denise and we’ll also be able to look at, if we’re not happy, what’s available to us within our own rules.” Asked whether possible action could include preventing Foster’s horses from running at Cheltenham, Harrington said: “I think at this point we’re having really good discussions with the IHRB so I’m not envisaging us getting to that point.” Thursday’s racing preview and tips Carlisle’s seven-race card sailed through its precautionary inspection at 7am on Thursday, and soft-to-heavy ground at what is already one of the most demanding tracks in the country will hold no fears for Evita Du Mesnil (1.00), a winner over course-and-distance, and in a strong time, under similar conditions last month. But the Tapeta at Newcastle could be a more reliable proposition for punters, and while the fillies’ handicap at Gosforth Park is short on numbers, it is still a competitive heat in which the highly-progressive Arafi (7.00) can be backed at around 15-8.      All five runners are a single-figure price and some backers may be deterred by Arafi’s 13lb hike in the weights for a win at Wolverhampton in February. Her winning time, though, suggests that Richard Hannon’s filly can take it in her stride. Putdecashonthedash (2.15) showed the benefit of a wind op with a return to form at Taunton last time and can follow up at Wincanton, while Smokey (3.35), at around 7-2, looks like the safest option at Southwell.\\n\",\n",

       "  'full_article': '1) It’s the north London derby this weekend and no one has a clue which Arsenal or Tottenham will turn up at the Emirates. What is known is that there will be no fans, meaning there will be no atmosphere. Hopefully there will be some of this sort of thing, a bit of this and potentially even plenty of this. Either way, it’s definitely worth a quick reminder of Paul Gascoigne’s genius. 2) Trying to skate on ice at high speed, while an opponent waves a stick in your face would result in mere mortals hitting the deck. Mat Barzal, however, kept his balance, before bamboozling the netminder and flicking the ball into the net with his stick reversed between his legs. For those who are not NHL fans, there is plenty more Barzal to witness. 3) When Bryson DeChambeau hits a golf ball, it stays hit. The technological advances allow the punter to now see the cleanness of the hit as the ball flies through the sky and down the fairway. The pleasurable ping of wood on ball is worth listening to over and over again. Even DeChambeau might struggle to see off the competition in a longest drive competition. 4) Kieron Pollard became just the third man to hit six sixes in an international over by blasting Akila Dananjaya all over the park. The West Indian joins India’s Yuvraj Singh and South Africa’s Herschelle Gibbs in achieving the feat. Pollard is following in the footsteps of his compatriot, the legendary Sir Garfield Sobers, who was the original six hitter.     5) Keely Hodgkinson became Great Britain’s youngest indoor champion since 1970 at the European Indoor Championships when she won the 800m in Torun. It was a reasonable week for Great Britain in Poland, sisters Cindy Sember and Tiffany Porter took home silver and bronze in the 60m hurdles. 6) Sometimes in football, you just got to do what you got to do.

       "  'title': '‘The year that transformed the world’: US museum launches Covid exhibition',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'From months of lockdown to seemingly endless mask wearing, homeschooling and the tedium of Zoom meetings, there are few aspects of the Covid-19 pandemic that those living through it will want to remember. But in Miami, at least, it is going to be impossible to forget. Artifacts and memories of the deadliest global pandemic in a century are on display at what is probably the nation’s first comprehensive coronavirus museum exhibition, forming an enduring testament to an unprecedented era.   Related: Vaccine vials and a virtual hug: a history of coronavirus in 15 objects   Highlights of the collection at the downtown HistoryMiami museum include personal protective equipment (PPE) worn by doctors who treated Covid-19 patients at a local hospital; an emergency beach closure order sign from Miami Beach; a sign from a closed, open, then closed again restaurant; a high school student’s mortarboard from her drive-through graduation ceremony; and a younger student’s school workbook from online learning. There are colorful handmade posters from drive-by birthday celebrations and first responder appreciation parades; vials of two of the first Pfizer vaccines administered at Jackson Memorial hospital; and a jar of hand sanitizer produced by Toast, a vodka company that switched operations at its Miami distillery early in the pandemic. Arguably the star exhibit is the gown and scythe belonging to the Grim Reaper, an outfit worn by a Florida attorney on several of the state’s crowded beaches last spring as he protested against the refusal of Governor Ron DeSantis to close them down. Daniel Uhlfelder, who is from Miami and majored in history before going on to practice law in Florida’s Panhandle, said the preservation of his costume was a powerful reminder of the politicization of the pandemic. “I hope people look at it and see what our elected officials and other people were doing wrong, and ignoring and lying and politicizing and scapegoating,” he said. “And I hope they see that there were people that decided to do something peacefully and creatively and honestly and courageously, and took things into their own hands. It’s a symbol of trying to get the public’s attention in a powerful way to get leaders to do the right thing.”    ‘I hope people look at it and see what our elected officials and other people were doing wrong, and ignoring and lying and politicizing and scapegoating,’ said Daniel Uhlfelder. Photograph: Douglas Lance/Courtesy of HistoryMiami   Jorge Zamanillo, HistoryMiami’s executive director and curator, said his team realized early in the pandemic that it was living history, and set about chronicling events as part of the museum’s Collecting 2020 initiative, which incorporates memorabilia from the Black Lives Matter protests of last summer, and November’s divisive elections. Other artifacts include a BLM jersey worn by Miami Heat basketball star Bam Adebayo, a prominent supporter of the racial justice movement; protest signs from BLM rallies that took place in Miami; and election materials, including some from the campaign of Danielle Levine Cara, Miami-Dade county’s first female mayor. “It was the year that really transformed the nation, the world and locally … we all pivoted and changed the way we live,” Zamanillo said. “We’re in the middle of this historic moment and what we are recording is a historical narrative that we are going to keep going back to and reading about.” Zamanillo said he recognized that people were keen to put the pandemic behind them, but it was important to archive their stories, even as they were still being affected by them. The museum has encouraged the public to send in their written or recorded memories. “You start to realize how personal it is, the impact emotionally on their family. Did they lose a loved one, did they contract Covid, or how did it affect their lives? Did they lose their jobs, or their business? Are they frontline workers? “When we look back in five, 10, 15 years, we’re going to have not just the artifacts, but the stories of how we hopefully learned as a community, how we survived this, how we transformed ourselves and how we improved.” The concept of chronicling the pandemic is not unique to Miami. Similar initiatives are under way in several other cities across the US and Canada, according to the Wall Street Journal. The Smithsonian National Museum of American History in Washington DC, for example, plans to exhibit a 3D-model of the virus created by Dr Anthony Fauci, the country’s leading infectious diseases expert. The museum already has a diverse Stories of 2020 collection online. In Miami, Zamanillo noted, the public can already visit the physical exhibition, albeit in restricted numbers due to Covid protocols. He said the collection was intended to be a comprehensive educational tool for future visitors, both locals and tourists, who would ask specific questions: “What made this special for you? How do you remember this moment? What are the stories and artifacts that relate to these things that help you remember this unforgettable year?” he said. “As painful as things may be right now, if we’re not the gatekeepers, the ones that make the effort to preserve these memories, no one else will.”\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'What Piers Morgan’s exit tells us about the future of impartial broadcasting in the UK | Jane Martinson',\n",
       "  'full_article': \"When the next history of the British media is written, there should be a chapter seeking to explain why it so often ends up being about Piers Morgan. Within 48 hours of Meghan and Prince Harry turning a much-needed spotlight on racism in the industry, Morgan’s sudden departure from ITV’s breakfast show shifted the attention not just to him, but to the issue of free speech. His comments tested the tension between freedom of expression and truth, just as two news channels are to be launched that could test the boundaries of the UK’s regulated, impartial TV media. This is not about whether Morgan will end up working for Rupert Murdoch’s News UK streaming service or Andrew Neil’s GB News (though the prospect of jobs at the channels undoubtedly eased his passage from ITV), but about whether it can possibly be right to publicly disown the truth of somebody else’s mental distress. The pretty obvious answer is that it cannot – and yet Morgan’s departure has still somehow managed to stir up a row over what impartiality means in broadcast news. It may be tempting to ignore this, but a failure to reassert the principles of impartiality will make it easier for broadcasters to succumb to the economic and political pressures pushing them towards the sort of partisan TV media that is common in the US.   Related: Is Britain's TV news at risk of being dominated by those who shout loudest?   But first, a recap for those struggling with the frenzied news cycle of the past few days. The morning after Meghan told Oprah Winfrey that she had contemplated suicide and received no help from the royal family, Morgan called her a liar. “I don’t believe a word she says, Meghan Markle. I wouldn’t believe her if she read me a weather report.” The charity Mind, which supports an ITV mental health campaign, joined many others, including his own colleagues, in accusing him of being irresponsible and harmful. Meanwhile, 41,000 people complained to media regulator Ofcom. When a mealy-mouthed comment about not disputing the real issues of mental health failed to stop his own colleagues criticising him on air, Morgan stomped off. In a departure note posted to Twitter on Wednesday morning, Morgan wrote: “I said I didn’t believe Meghan Markle in her Oprah interview. I’ve had time to reflect on this opinion, and I still don’t. If you did, OK. Freedom of speech is a hill I’m happy to die on.” Inevitably, he posted a picture of Churchill with the old saw: “Some people’s idea of free speech is that they are free to say what they like, but if anyone says anything back, that is an outrage.” Some of Morgan’s old colleagues at CNN rallied to his defence. Anchor Jake Tapper called the reaction “insanity” and tweeted: “This is what happens when you live in a country where there is no First amendment.” Tapper suggested that it would be better for complainants to “tweet Piers what you think of his comments” rather than go to the regulator, part of whose job it is to prevent public service broadcasters causing harm and offence. Tapper is a brilliant presenter (as is Morgan in many ways), but his idea that Twitter is the place for redress underlines just how far down a nasty rabbit hole the American idea of freedom has led us: to a place where conspiracy theories and hatred can be disseminated by US social media giants without any sanction at all. After all, it was almost exactly a year ago that presenters such as Sean Hannity on Fox News were given the freedom to accuse the media of “scaring the living hell out of people” with the “new hoax” of the coronavirus. The rules regarding harm and offence governed by Ofcom’s Broadcasting Code are written in the sort of legalese that would never go viral. Yet, along with public opinion, they are more or less the last bulwarks ensuring that the British broadcast media remains committed to offering as unbiased a version of events as is possible, unlike the newspapers, which are under no such mandate. The UK system is far from perfect, of course. Rumours that the Daily Mail’s Paul Dacre is the prime minister’s preferred candidate for the top job at Ofcom and the very history of BBC licence fee negotiations alone demonstrate this. But in a world in which the business model for news has been ripped up, broadcast regulation means that the influential media is not governed by commercial interests alone. Still, Morgan’s last Good Morning Britain show on Tuesday was watched by 1.29m viewers, more than its much quieter BBC rival with 1.25m. The problem is that outrage sells, just look at the history of tabloid newspapers in the UK. Murdoch, who has possibly made more money out of the British media than anyone else, knows this. My money is on a new Piers Morgan morning show on the soon-to-be streamed News UK. The good news is that brilliant journalists of colour such as Ranvir Singh and Clive Myrie are already being tipped to replace the former host on Good Morning Britain. • Jane Martinson is a Guardian columnist\\n\",\n",

       "  'title': \"14-hour days and no bathroom breaks: Amazon's overworked delivery drivers\",\n",
       "  'full_article': \"  Sign up for the Guardian Today US newsletter  James Meyers worked as a driver for several Amazon delivery service providers in Austin, Texas, for about one year until he quit in October 2020 citing the immense workloads and poor working conditions. Fourteen-hour shifts were common because delivery service providers wouldn’t allow drivers to return any packages from their routes and the pressure to meet delivery rates meant Meyers used a plastic bottle to go to the bathroom on a daily basis. “I saw no effort on Amazon’s part to push delivery service providers to allow their drivers to use the restroom on a normal human basis, leading many, myself included, to urinate inside bottles for fear of slowing down our delivery rates,” Meyers said.   Related: 'We deserve more': an Amazon warehouse’s high-stakes union drive   “Any time a van is off route or stops for longer than three minutes, it notifies the delivery service provider. Amazon encourages the delivery service owners to cut down on said stops. I would personally get called by a dispatcher every time I stopped to go to the bathroom. Sitting on the phone with them made the stop take longer. It just wasn’t worth the angry looks in the morning or the worry I’d get fired.” Amazon uses contractors for delivery services, a move Meyers said makes it exceedingly difficult for workers to organize, and he said, contributes to drivers being overworked and underpaid by the delivery service providers who are paid bonuses on metrics such as route completion percentages. Amazon has been publicly opposed to unionization and organizing among their employees, most recently through an anti-union campaign launched ahead of a union election vote at a warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama, which has included anti-union captive audience meetings and sending mass texts and ads to workers encouraging them to vote against the union. The Teamsters Union is now working with drivers at Amazon delivery service providers around the US over concerns about the retail giant’s impact on the transportation industry and use of subcontractors.    An Amazon delivery driver pushes a cart of groceries to load into a vehicle outside of a distribution facility on 2 February 2021 in Redondo Beach, California Photograph: Patrick T Fallon/AFP/Getty Images   “This sort of model is problematic for the entire industry,” said Randy Korgan, the director of the Teamster’s Amazon Project. “They’re willing to loan these small subcontractors money, get them access to their vans and help them advertise for employees to offload all the responsibility that would normally fall on Amazon.” The Teamsters currently represent pilots at two Amazon air transport contractors. Korgan said the wages Amazon delivery drivers receive, starting at $15 an hour, are far below the average wages for drivers at companies like UPS, where Teamsters represent about 240,000 workers. Based on the union’s current contract, UPS drivers start at $21 an hour and can make up to $40 an hour or more. “If Amazon decides to take millions of jobs and essentially cut their labor costs in half, that only comes out of workers’ pockets,” added Korgan. “That creates a major economic problem in an industry that for the last 50 years has done a good job of supporting millions of middle-class jobs.” In Iowa, the Des Moines Register reported the Teamsters are organizing drivers and warehouse workers at Amazon for higher pay and less stringent rates, utilizing strikes rather than focusing on union elections through the National Labor Relations Board. Drivers for Amazon contractors have complained of the surveillance and pressure they receive through cameras and a tracking app, Mentor. A driver for an Amazon delivery service provider in the Portland, Oregon area, who requested to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation, expressed concerns over the surveillance cameras being installed in delivery vehicles, as she often has to use the bathroom in the van due to the lack of available public restrooms and pressure against taking time off of routes to use them. “In order to take a bathroom break, especially being a woman, we would have to be in an area that has a grocery store. That isn’t always the case and even if it were, that would take at least 10 minutes off our drive time, in which our dispatch would wonder why we’re falling behind,” she said. “So instead, I keep a cup with me and wipes and I go to the bathroom in the back of my van. I’m very concerned about the AI technology being installed in the vans, and being seen while I am urinating is just one of my concerns.” Drivers for Amazon delivery service providers also face fear of retaliation for trying to organize in their workplaces. Derrick Flournoy worked as a driver for an Amazon Delivery Service Provider in Downers Grove, Illinois, for more than one year before he quit after experiencing retaliation from management for organizing an online chat for workers to discuss grievances on the job such as the lack of pay increases.   Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk have gone back and forth every week about who is the wealthiest person in the world and I can’t even pay my rent  Derrick Flournoy    “I started the chat group on a Friday morning, and about an hour after the chat group was put up the manager took it down, which we didn’t even know that he had the power to do if he wasn’t included in the chat, and then he also disabled my ability within the entire app to even communicate with anybody, unless it was directly with management,” said Flournoy, who filed an unfair labor practice charge through the Amazon Delivery Drivers Coalition against Amazon after he was removed from his work shift immediately after the incident. “To me, it was obvious retaliation, and it was his way of showing that he had power and if we didn’t basically form a model of who he wanted, that he could take our hours.” Flournoy made $16 an hour, which remained unchanged from when he started in December 2019 to when he left in February 2021, even as a 40-hour full-time work week wasn’t guaranteed. “Sixteen dollars an hour isn’t enough for the amount of work that we have to do. We’re a representation of the wealthiest company in the world and we’re barely making enough money to live,” Flournoy added. “I just think that it’s crazy to me that Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk have gone back and forth every week about who is the wealthiest person in the world and I can’t even pay my rent. I’m breaking my back to deliver packages every day and there’s no compassion from upper management to understand or to listen to drivers’ concerns.” An Amazon spokesperson claimed drivers have built-in time through their routes for breaks and provide a list of nearby restrooms in the delivery app. They did not comment on the unfair labor practice charge or on organizing efforts by drivers. “We’re proud to empower more than 2,000 delivery service partners around the country – small businesses that create thousands more jobs and offer a great work environment with pay of at least $15/hour, healthcare benefits, and paid time off,” the spokesperson said in an email.\\n\",\n",

       "  'title': \"How laws allow the world's largest police departments to use lethal force \",\n",
       "  'full_article': \"Police departments in major cities across the world give their officers legal impunity to use lethal force even when their lives are not in danger, according to new research commissioned by the Guardian. The study by the University of Chicago and its research partners found that not one police department of the cities surveyed had policies that were consistent with human rights guidelines set forth by the UN when it comes to use-of-force policies. The report involved 48 major US and international cities,  many in some of the richest, most democratic countries in the world. This research reveals that not only are police officers in the US and beyond acting violently with impunity, but that their professional codes allow them to do so. The research comes as police forces are under intense scrutiny in the year after the brutal killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police and the unprecedented wave of uprisings that followed.     “The nation is going to be looking at this [George Floyd case] with new consciousness and awareness, but [Derek Chauvin, the officer who killed Floyd] is being prosecuted under the same old laws and the same old system,” said Sherri Williams, a professor at American University who writes about and analyzes police violence.  List of the 48 cities that were in the study. None of them have human-rights-compliant laws.  The findings by the University of Chicago Global Rights Clinic will appear in a forthcoming report, Global Impunity. In an analysis commissioned by the Guardian for our ongoing project Overpoliced, Underprotected, researchers compared a city’s written use-of-force policies with several UN documents, including the UN code of conduct for law enforcement officials, which emphasizes that lethal force should only be used when officers are faced with immediate and grave threats to their own lives or the lives of others. The research focuses on rich and developed nations in order to compare places with comparable resources. It includes disproportionately more US cities to provide a foundation for the scope of the project. In the US, 987 people were killed by the police in the past year. The rate is almost triple that of the neighboring Canada and 30 times that of Germany. “The sheer number of countries, police departments in the US and across the globe that tell their police officers that you can use deadly force – shoot someone – if they are resisting arrest or running away is staggering,” said Nino Guruli, one of the authors and a staff attorney at UIC John Marshall Law School’s International Human Rights Clinic. “As if it is more important to complete an arrest or not retreat than to prevent unnecessary death and suffering.”To analyze use-of-force policies, the researchers used an evaluation scale based on four categories: whether a city’s use of lethal force is considered legal under international law; whether lethal force can be used only for an immediate threat and only as last resort; whether it can be used only in response to an equally deadly threat; and whether police are accountable to an independent oversight body for the use of lethal force. In 13 cities, the research found, officers are permitted to use lethal force even if they have not exhausted all the other options available to them, such as de-escalation tactics.  Cities that have less stringent use of force policies.  In Denver, for instance, officers are allowed to use lethal force to arrest or prevent an escape of an individual based on past crime – without any requirement that the suspect pose a present and immediate threat:  105.2. A peace officer is justified in using deadly physical force … only when he reasonably believes that it is necessary: b. To effect an arrest or prevent the escape from custody, of a person whom he reasonably believes: 1. Has committed or attempted to commit a felony involving the use or threatened use of deadly weapon  Such policies often come under increased scrutiny during highly public police brutality cases. The murder of Eric Garner – a New York man choked to death during his arrest – spurred a ban on chokeholds in the state after protests erupted across the country. Similarly, with the deaths of Floyd and Elijah McClain, who was also killed last year, civil rights lawyers have called into question whether police were acting under some kind of threat to their own lives. In 25 cities, officers are permitted to use deadly force in response to a lesser threat, or when there is no immediate threat.  Charts showing where officers are permitted to use deadly force in response to a lesser threat.  This can vary dramatically. Philadelphia has clear language prohibiting police officers from using deadly force if there is no longer an “objectively reasonable belief that the suspect is dangerous, even if the deadly force could have been justified at an earlier point in time”. But in Indianapolis, the policy is far more opaque, only requiring a “threat of deadly force” to act. Accountability for the use of lethal force is also often lacking. The researchers found that many police departments across the world don’t require police to report when they use excessive force – even when it is deadly. This leads to both a lack of accountability for the use of lethal force among police forces and also a gap in the public’s understanding of what happened, due in large part to the lack of adequate documentation. Only eight cities require internal reporting of an officer who uses deadly force, and 16 cities require that reporting when it results in a death or injury.  Cities that have less stringent reporting policies after officers use force.  Richard Aborn, president of the Citizens Crime Commission of New York City, said the lack of reporting requirements can be dismal. “It’s what message the police agency leadership sends. “I think if we just did that – disciplined those cases – we wouldn’t need to change these policies.” But if the cities are unlikely to report their use of force internally, reporting these incidents externally feels even harder to enforce.  Cities that have less stringent reporting policies after officers use force.  “Laws and policies are critical to government accountability and transparency. This is especially true in the area of law enforcement where the state is granted the power to end human life,” said Claudia Flores, report author and associate clinical professor of law and director of the Global Human Rights Clinic at the University of Chicago Law School.  Campaign groups are advocating a range of reforms. The demands include curbing the unchecked power of police unions, which often help create the use of force policies themselves, and requiring community oversight of negotiations within the contracts. “We have historical amnesia about how we really treat people in this country,” said Williams. “We’re acting like we don’t really know [these policies] were designed to do what they’re doing.” The research revealed – which may come as a surprise to those focusing on police brutality and systemic racism in the US – that New York City actually had the strongest policies and guidelines on excessive use of force, followed by Mexico City and Buenos Aires. Meanwhile, Riyadh, Mumbai and Paris occupied the lowest rankings on the list. But that doesn’t necessarily mean the top cities have better police departments, or fewer extrajudicial killings. A more comprehensive policy doesn’t always denote accountability, or the power of law to enforce such a policy. In the past year it has become increasingly clear that the power of police forces has gone unchecked for far too long. Since then, government and grassroots voices in the US have been demanding an end to centuries of racist and poor policing practices and policies. In early March, the US House of Representatives voted on one of the most comprehensive police reform bills in the history of the country: the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. The legislation – which is unlikely to pass the Senate owing to Republican opposition – includes several sweeping changes to how police do their jobs, including a ban on chokeholds.   Related: These US cities defunded police: 'We're transferring money to the community'   This year, the UN also convened a group of experts on the use of force. They called on the US to adopt wide-ranging reforms and end police brutality. They admonished police departments for using teargas and other harsh measures on protesters and recognized the increasing militarization of US police weapons. “Policing reforms must adopt genuine and substantive measures to dismantle systemic racism in policing, including against racial, ethnic and other minorities, by divestment from current policing budgets and reinvestment in alternative social and economic resources that are vital for the safety of these communities,” they stated. But those reforms in policies, and in laws, may come too late for the case that will determine whether the former police officer Derek Chauvin will be held accountable for kneeling on George Floyd’s neck for more than eight minutes. “Last summer was a summer of conversation,” said Johnetta Elzie, a civil rights activist and co-founder of Campaign Zero, an advocacy and research group focused on ending police brutality. “Now it depends on who and what entity cares enough to hold the police and police unions accountable.” Global Impunity will be published in May and is authored by Claudia Flores, associate clinical professor of law and director of the Global Human Rights Clinic at the University of Chicago Law School; Nino Guruli, staff attorney, UIC John Marshall Law School, International Human Rights Clinic; Brian Citro, human rights lawyer and independent researcher; Mariana Olaizola, fellow and faculty, Global Human Rights Clinic at the University of Chicago Law School; and Chelsea Kehrer and Hannah Abrahams, students, University of Chicago Law School\\n\",\n",

       "  'title': \"China adopts new laws to ensure only 'patriots' can govern Hong Kong\",\n",
       "  'full_article': 'China’s rubber stamping parliamentary body has unanimously – bar one abstention and to sustained and loud applause – approved new laws ensuring that only people it deems “patriots” can govern Hong Kong, in a move critics say signals the end of the city’s remaining autonomy. The final meeting of the National People’s Congress (NPC) at the annual “two sessions” political gathering also approved new domestic amendments and budgets, and the 14th five-year-plan, intended to strengthen and expand China’s domestic technology industry and market, and reach new GDP and population targets amid economic uncertainty and declining birth rates. In a formal vote the almost 3,000 NPC delegates approved a decision to amend Hong Kong’s mini constitution, the basic law, and the electoral system to ensure that people opposed to the Chinese Communistparty and its rule over Hong Kong are ineligible to sit in the city’s parliament. The UK’s foreign minister, Dominic Raab, was quick to criticise the move. “This is the latest step by Beijing to hollow out the space for democratic debate in Hong Kong, contrary to the promises made by China itself,” he said. “This can only further undermine confidence and trust in China living up to its international responsibilities and legal obligations as a leading member of the international community.” According to Chinese state media, the decision will increase the number of seats in Hong Kong’s legislature from 70 to 90, and the election committee charged with choosing a chief executive from 1,200 to 1,500. The published details did not say where the extra 20 seats would come from. Hong Kong’s legislature currently includes 35 directly elected legislators, and 35 from mostly pro-Beijing representative constituencies. The changes will also establish a vetting panel responsible for “reviewing and confirming the qualifications” of committee and political political candidates in line with the national security law and basic law. Early media reports cited unnamed sources as saying the panel would be made up of some of the most pro-Beijing members of Hong Kong’s political elite, including delegates to the NPC and the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). “The meeting made the decision to approve the electoral system in Hong Kong, and won the approval from all deputies, including those from Hong Kong,” said the chair of the NPC standing committee, Li Zhanshu. The decision will now go to the standing committee for further processing before it is promulgated. In the past year new laws and regulations in Hong Kong, including a draconian national security law and a concerted campaign of protest-related prosecutions, have resulted in almost every significant voice of opposition being in jail, on trial or in exile overseas. The changes have drawn international condemnation. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, told Congress on Wednesday that the Biden administration would “follow through on sanctions … against those responsible for committing repressive acts in Hong Kong”. The US and other countries have repeatedly objected to the crackdown with little effect. Hong Kong’s government has welcomed the Beijing crackdown, including Thursday’s changes, but has indicated it wasn’t involved in the NPC’s design of the details.  Chief executive, Carrie Lam, said her government would amend Hong Kong law’s in line with the new decision over the next 12 months. She denied it was a backwards step for democracy, but instead closed “loopholes” allowing “unpatriotic people” to “harm” Hong Kong with anti-Beijing and pro-independence moves. She dismissed all suggestions that the changes would reduce government accountability through opposition. “I truly believe that when this is done … we will be able to effectively resolve the problems we face in Hong Kong, [that is] everything being politicised and the difficult situation it has been placed in.” After the NPC vote an editorial in the state mouthpiece, Xinhua, praised the approval and said “in some sense, Beijing had no choice”. “Anti-China, destabilising forces and radical localists in Hong Kong have manipulated the electoral system to enter the governance structure …pushed for their secessionist agenda, repeatedly challenged the central government’s authority,” it said, adding that “reckless foreign intervention” also warranted the change. “Hostile forces overseas have intensified their efforts to stoke “color revolutions” in the Chinese city, seeking to turn it into an outpost to contain China’s development,” it said. “No central government would tolerate such chaos or ignore outside disruptors running amok on its soil.” Speaking to press after the sessions, the premier, Li Keqiang, praised the passage of the decision, and the approval of China’s 14th five-year plan, which included GDP growth targets of “above 6%” and a focus on boosting China’s tech industry. “We are keenly aware of the uncertainty around the economic rebound in China, as well as global economic growth and development,” Li said of the GDP target, which is below many analysts’ predictions. “It’s not a low target,” he said. “6% means generating an output of 6 trillion yuan.” An earlier draft of the five-year plan included increases to research and development spending and “major breakthroughs” in core technologies including medical equipment, core components and basic materials – a sign of Beijing’s growing competitiveness with the US and Taiwan’s semiconductor manufacturing. “We must reject any urge for quick success and take solid measures with one step at a time.” Li said the government would “solidify the foundations of basic research”, including by offering 100% tax deductions on R&D costs for manufacturers. Ahead of a high-level bilateral meeting in Alaska next week, Li also urged improved relations with the US, but signalled China had no intention of conceding to criticisms of its actions in Xinjiang, Hong Kong and towards Taiwan. “We hope the two sides will respect the core interests and major concerns, refrain from interfering in each others internal affairs … and keep in the principle of no conflict, no confrontation, mutual respect, and win-win cooperation.” \\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'Brexit: trade survey finds 74% of British firms hit by delays with EU markets',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Three-quarters of British manufacturers are struggling to cope with delays in moving goods in and out of the EU amid continuing disruption caused by Brexit and the Covid pandemic, industry figures said. Two months after the UK left the EU on trade terms agreed by Boris Johnson’s government, research from the manufacturing trade group Make UK has shown that 74% of firms in a survey of more than 200 leading industrial companies are facing delays with EU imports and exports. Faced with mounting Brexit red tape, customs checks and disruption to global trade caused by the pandemic, more than half of companies said they were suffering from increased costs. More than a third had lost out on sales, while fears over continued disruption was losing firms future business. The warning comes as pressure grows on the government to resolve difficulties at UK borders amid concern over the impact on the British economy and jobs at a time when businesses are grappling with the Covid recession. A government spokesperson insisted that freight volumes between the UK and the EU were now “back to their normal levels” and said there was “no general disruption at UK ports”. Ministers have made £20m available to help small businesses adapt to the new trade relationships. “We will ensure businesses get the support they need to trade effectively with Europe and to seize new opportunities as we strike trade deals with the world’s fastest-growing markets,” the spokesperson added. However, business leaders said trading activity was under severe strain and only likely to worsen as further border checks came into force. Ray Singh, managing director of Russel Finex, a London-based manufacturer of high-performance sieves and filters, said his firm was still experiencing delays with exports to the EU and to a plant it operated in Belgium. “Eventually we manage to get the goods over, but it just takes a lot longer. It’s not smooth like it was. There are additional checks and paperwork and it sounds like in a few months’ time that’s actually going to ramp up, which is more stuff not to look forward to. It’s created a lot of extra bureaucracy that just wasn’t there before,” Singh said.  Catherine Bedford, founder of Dashel, which makes carbon fibre and recycled cycle helmets, said the disruption was killing her business. “Thanks to Brexit, we’ve gone from profitable to barely scraping by,” she said. “We can’t predict delivery times as items are being held up at French customs, our entry point into Europe. There is a massive backlog and items are being turned back despite up-to-date paperwork.” Figures from Germany this week showed that imports from the UK had fallen by more than 56% to €1.6bn (£1.4bn) in January from the same month a year ago amid Brexit disruption. Official UK trade figures are due to be published on Friday. The international trade secretary, Liz Truss, is pushing to expand trading opportunities outside the EU, and next week the government is expected to set out Britain’s post-Brexit trade priorities as part of a delayed review of foreign policy. However, Make UK said that ministers urgently needed to “get back around the table” with EU leaders to solve problems closer to home. The EU accounts for almost half of UK imports and exports, while the government’s own analysis suggests that trade deals outside the EU will not make up for the impact of Brexit on the UK economy. Stephen Phipson, chief executive of Make UK, said: “Government needs to move smooth out difficulties at UK ports so that shipments can easily be delivered. We are encouraged that the government is already working to train more high-quality customs officials and to give more assistance with customs paperwork, but this needs to be driven forward at speed to give the quickest possible assistance to British companies already struggling to get back to normal as trade recovers from the Covid pandemic.”\\n',\n",

       "  'title': \"The Bears are in a perfect position to end Russell Wilson's Seahawks career\",\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Russell Wilson is the latest franchise star to put himself forward for this offseason’s game of quarterback musical chairs.  Wilson, his agent has been at pains to point out, has not officially demanded a trade from Seattle, but he has – in a delightfully passive-aggressive, Wilson-esque way – made it clear to the team’s decision-makers that he is unhappy with the direction of the franchise and that he would prefer to leave.  According to a detailed report in The Athletic, Wilson is unhappy with the team’s roster construction, the style of head coach/chief decision-maker Pete Carroll, and the Seahawks’ offensive system.  At the center of the rift are two practical elements. First, Wilson’s desire to play in a modern, pace-and-space system similar to that which the Kansas City Chiefs have built around Patrick Mahomes, with everything flowing through the quarterback. Second, Seattle’s awful offensive line, one that has ranked dead stinking last in pressure rate in three out of the past five seasons.  Carroll is an old-school, pound-the-run, play-solid-defense, don’t-turn-the-ball-over, coach. That served Wilson and the Seahawks well during the early years of the duo’s partnership. Behind an all-time defense, a bulldozing run-game led by Marshawn Lynch, and the playmaking brilliance of Wilson, the team went to back-to-back Super Bowls, winning one and losing the other. But as Wilson matured into one of the most well-rounded quarterbacks in the game and the roster around him disintegrated, Carroll did not evolve. He freed up the scheme and catered the system to Wilson in part, but the foundations remained run-first and risk-averse.    Related: Dak Prescott agrees to four-year, $160m contract with Dallas Cowboys   Whereas Wilson looked in the mirror and saw Aaron Rodgers, Tom Brady and Peyton Manning – quarterbacks with the freedom to change the play at the line of scrimmage and who had near-complete autonomy over the system – Carroll looked at his quarterback and saw a fantastic cog in his machine. The scheme still won out. All the while, Wilson was taking a beating – no quarterback has been hit more since he entered the league, and no quarterback has been hit at the same rate over a three-year span as Wilson has between 2018-2021. There was a change in philosophy last season though. After a three-year drum beat of #LetRussCook, an online movement that began to infiltrate the locker room – shorthand for Let Russell Wilson Pass More – Carroll handed Wilson the reins to the offense.  Still: the quarterback was seen as a player, not a collaborator. He was not offered the kind of quarterback-coach partnership that Rodgers, Manning and Brady had at the peak of their powers, the kind that Wilson believes he has earned over nine years. “I know that I’m a great football player,” Wilson said last season. “I know I’ve been great, I know I will be great, and I know I’ll continue to be great.” And Wilson was great at the start of the 2020 season. Behind’s Wilson’s excellence, Seattle averaged four-and-a-half touchdowns per game over the first half of the season, the kind of total matched only by the Brady led Patriots of 2007, Manning’s 2013 Broncos, and the 2000 Rams – widely regarded as the best offensive teams of this century.  It was a stunning rebuke of the Carroll doctrine. Wilson had finally been allowed to cook, and he proved to be the best chef in the game. Through eight weeks, he topped the MVP charts; even Mahomes could not keep pace. Wilson was able to maintain all of the efficiency that has defined his game with even more explosiveness.  And then he cratered. After his best start to a season, Wilson flatlined over the final eight weeks. For the first time in his career, he finished outside the top 10 in Football Outsiders’ DVOA metric, a measure of a quarterback’s down-to-down efficiency (Wilson has been a demigod of DVOA over the span of his career). In a blink, Carroll returned to the Seahawks’ style of old. When Wilson tried to offer some input into the gameplan in the middle of last season’s decline, he was rebuffed by the coaching staff. Wilson stormed out of the meeting.  Like any great drama, Wilson’s real beef is not about how the team does things. It’s about respect. He wants to be a partner, a part of a decision-making board, not an employee. “The most important people in the building,” Seahawks general manager John Schneider told reporters back in 2018, “are the head coach and the quarterback.” Wilson wants to hold him to that. And then there’s his need for external respect. For all of his excellence, for all of the plaudits, Wilson has still never received a single MVP vote. By throwing more, by posting the kind of numbers he did over the first half of last season for 16 games, he thinks he can finally get his hands on the MVP – that stuff really, really matters to Wilson.  At the most important position in the sport, Wilson has been the game’s most consistent performer for the better part of a decade, and this despite the sense that the Seahawks system has held him back. Seattle’s rebuttal is an obvious one: Wilson has been good because of the system and its risk-averse nature, not in spite of it. When the handbrake came off, it proved to be unsustainable. The eye test – which often involves Wilson running here, there, and everywhere to avoid pressure – does not jibe with the team’s assessment. Tired of getting hit. Tired of playing in a plodding system. Tired of not being the sole focus of the franchise, Wilson appears to want out. Like another unsettled quarterback, Deshaun Watson, Wilson has a no-trade clause in his contract, arming him with a ton of leverage over the Seahawks – he will have more say than the team on where he plays in 2021 and beyond if he does move. His agent told ESPN that while Wilson will not demand an official trade, he has made it known to the Seahawks hierarchy the teams he would be willing to waive his no-trade clause to move to the Cowboys, Saints, Raiders, or Bears. Dak Prescott’s new bumper deal rules Dallas out, while it seems increasingly likely that Drew Brees will return for one final ride with the Saints. That leaves us with the Raiders and Bears.   Related: Wilson to the Raiders? Watson to the Jets? NFL quarterback trade possibilities   Chicago make the most sense. The only way for the Bears to improve this offseason is to trade for a game-changing quarterback, either Wilson or Watson. The Bears have two paths heading into 2021: they land a franchise-altering quarterback and are a playoff team with holes on the roster; or they improve marginally at quarterback – either with Mitchell Trubisky developing or by landing another option in free agency – and they fall short again. It’s impractical for Chicago to think their defense can hold up at a high level for another season. Wilson knows how quickly elite defenses age. They’re great, then they stink. A good defense is never as a reliable as a good offense: a defense requires 20 talented players, an excellent scheme and a savvy play-caller; an offense can thrive with a great quarterback and a couple of talented pieces. There are very few deals that the Bears should turn down. Hand over the roster sheet, ask the Seahawks what they want, and include whatever picks are needed to flesh out the deal. Put the pressure on Seattle to turn it down and on Wilson to say yes or no. Has this offseason noise been hot air? Are the Wilson comments and leaks about airing grievances, about politics, about public relations? Or is he really looking for a change of scenery and a better shot to win an MVP and a championship? The Bears are the ones who can force the issue. It’s a small window, but it’s one the Bears and Wilson should both try to take advantage of. Wilson has spent much of his career as a polished professional. On a team that was infamously loud and outspoken – a loudness encouraged by the coach – he was the quiet one, to the point where his teammates questioned his motives. Now, in the era of quarterback empowerment, when Watson is talking of early retirement to force Houston’s hand and Matthew Stafford was able to force a move out of Detroit, Wilson has a chance to make his move. For a man who cares so much about his legacy, how he leaves a place appears to be essential. It’s why he’s playing footsie with other teams while Watson chose to hit the burn-it-all-down button. To force a move out of Seattle, Wilson may have to follow Watson’s lead. Will he?\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'The Columnist review – middle class writer on a murder spree',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'To paraphrase Nietzsche: gaze too long into Twitter, and Twitter will gaze into you. Anyone who writes for a living on the internet has surely fantasised about payback time for all the keyboard warriors, callous below-the-liners and unrepentant trolls out there. Ivo van Aart’s movie gives full rein to that desire and is snappily directed – but in the end there is something self-satisfied and sententious about his feminist revenge flick. Katja Herbers plays Femke Boot, a newspaper columnist drowning in internet misogyny, especially after she steps out of her usual lifestyle remit to write an op-ed about Zwarte Piet, the Dutch blackface folkloric character. Her book publisher is pressurising her for juicier material to better compete with author-of-the-hour Steven Dood (Steven Death), a kohl-rimmed provocateur who savages her on a chatshow. Umbilically fed by her phone on a diet of shitposter abuse, she finally snaps when she realises her neighbour – partial to some Zwarte Piet himself – is one of her tormentors.    As her serial-mom killing spree gets under way, Van Aart drapes a couple of complementary plotlines around it: her daughter Anna (Claire Porro) is fired from the school newspaper and, via the medium of F-bomb-loaded banners, fights a battle for free speech. And when Femke ends up in bed with Dood, it turns out his gothic bad boy persona is just a pose, and he is actually keeper material. These aspects hover soberly around the themes of free expression and online identities – but dilute the black comedy Van Aart attempts to operate with elsewhere. There is some nice absurdist carnage, such as middle-class mum Femke creeping along a gutter to tip a neighbour off the roof in her inaugural murder. But the humour isn’t sharpened to a fine point, leaving each new death to bludgeon in The Columnist’s thesis with the blunt end: online life has robbed us of the ability to appreciate nuance and difference. Femke’s graduation to monster lacks the delicious irony it’s shooting for, as a few plot-logic slips en route – why leave uncleaned weapons around for others to discover? – betray Van Aart’s haste to get his opinion out there.  • The Columnist is released on 12 March on digital platforms.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'Our Lady of the Nile by Scholastique Mukasonga review – ominous Rwandan tale',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Our Lady of the Nile is a girls’ boarding school high in the hills of Rwanda, very near the spring that is the source of the Nile; there is a plaque announcing its “discovery” (“Cock Mission, 1924”), and a statue of the Virgin Mary, or possibly the ancient goddess Isis, erected by a Belgian bishop in 1953. In the 1980s the school is run by French nuns to educate the daughters of Rwanda’s elite, training them “not simply to be good wives and mothers, but also good citizens and good Christians … to spearhead women’s advancement”. National tensions are rarely explicitly addressed in the business of school life, but a sinister dynamic unnerves the reader from early on with the arrival of Gloriosa, who “stepped out of a black Mercedes with tinted windows, preceded by her mother”. The mother has to rush back to the city for dinner with the Belgian ambassador, but “Gloriosa announced that she would stand with Sister Gertrude at the gate, beneath the national flag, to greet the other seniors and let them know that the first meeting of the committee she chaired would take place the following day”. Gloriosa’s rival Goretti “also made a grand entrance, perched on the back of a huge military vehicle whose six thick tyres took the spectators’ breath away”, alongside soldiers in camouflage fatigues. Against the background of landscape description and a playful postcolonial history of the school, these two cars are enough for us to understand that something darker lies beneath the comic accounts of adolescence that follow. The girls, given unfamiliar food by a French cook, bicker over treats brought from home for midnight feasts: “Beans and cassava paste, with a special sauce … bananas slowly baked overnight … red gahungezi sweet potatoes; corncobs; peanuts; and even, for the city girls, doughnuts of every colour under the sun.” They take walks in the long rainy season, compare their growing bodies, tease and boast about boyfriends, make fun of “Mr Hair”, a young French maths teacher on voluntary service overseas. They are, perhaps, more realistic about their own future prospects than their teachers are: “We were already fine merchandise,” says Immaculée, “and a diploma will inflate our worth even more.” For a while, the spats between girls who take the convent ideology seriously and those who regard the routines of study and prayer as an inconvenience seem as serious as those between the daughters of Hutu “majority people” and the two girls who constitute the required quota of Tutsis. These two, Veronica and Virginia, take to sneaking off into the forest to visit the Parisian Monsieur de Fontenaille, who in youth “set off for Africa to seek his fortune” and is now a kind of heart of whiteness, Conrad’s Kurtz replayed as farce. Monsieur de Fontenaille has developed an obsession with painting the portraits of Tutsi girls, convinced that he alone can restore to the Tutsis the ancestral memory of their heritage in “the empire of black pharaohs”. He wants to paint Veronica as the goddess Isis and Virginia as Queen Candace, apparently believing them to be descendants or even reincarnations of the ancient rulers of his fantasies. “I don’t think he even sees the same landscape as we do,” says Veronica. “It’s like a movie playing in his head, but now he wants flesh-and-blood actresses, and that’s us.” He drugs the girls, not primarily to assault them but to dress them in the costumes and masks of his pharaonic/Tutsi myth of origin. Veronica knows perfectly well what’s going on, but the money she finds in her bra is useful. This post-colonial satire is the background to Virginia and Veronica’s more acute danger, which comes from Gloriosa, the society waiting to believe her lies and the thugs at her father’s command. The ending is violent, bleak and wholly believable. Melanie Mauthner has made a perfectly pitched translation of the original French, which is eerily laconic, both comedy and tragedy hauntingly understated. The novel reminded me Magda Szabó’s brilliant Abigail, another school story for grownups that is also a book about our inability or refusal to protect children from history. • Sarah Moss’s Summerwater is published by Granta.

       "  'full_article': \"The chief executive at one of Australia’s largest law firms has left by “mutual agreement” after a firestorm erupted about representing Christian Porter. Annette Kimmitt left MinterEllison on Wednesday, a week after she told staff in an email she was “triggered” by news that senior partner Peter Bartlett was acting for a cabinet minister at the centre of a rape allegation. MinterEllison’s chairman, David O’Brien, told staff via an email sent about 10pm on Wednesday that Kimmitt had left, and would be replaced in an acting capacity by managing partner Virginia Briggs. The news had been reported online hours earlier.   Related: Scott Morrison declares Christian Porter 'innocent' and says he will remain in role   “I am writing to let you know that we have mutually agreed with Annette Kimmitt, our chief executive officer and managing partner of the firm since 2018, that she will leave the firm on 10 March 2021,” O’Brien wrote. “We have thanked Annette for her years of service and dedication and wished her well for the future. “During her time at MinterEllison, among her many achievements, Annette led our firm successfully through the pandemic, for which we are most grateful.” On 3 March, Kimmitt sent an email to the firm’s more than 2,500 staff titled “CONFIDENTIAL – High profile matter”. The night before, the Guardian reported that Bartlett was acting for the minister, who was expected to break his silence regarding the allegations the following day. Kimmitt wrote: “You have no doubt all read, heard and seen the press today that one of our partners is acting on a high profile matter. “Unfortunately, like you, I only became aware last night that the firm is acting, through Twitter and media reports. “The acceptance of this matter did not go through the firm’s due consultation or approval processes. Had it done so we would have considered the matter through the lens of our purpose and our values.” She acknowledged some staff may be distressed by the news and urged those who were to access the employee assistance program. “The nature of this matter is clearly causing hurt to some of you, and it has certainly triggered hurt for me. I know that for many it may be a tough day, and I want to apologise for the pain you may be experiencing.”   Related: Legal Practice Board of WA unlikely to investigate Christian Porter   Later that afternoon, Porter held a media conference confirming he was at the centre of the rape allegation dating back to the 1980s, and categorically denied the claim. Kimmitt’s email was leaked to the Australian Financial Review and published last Friday, as tensions started to boil over within the firm. Porter had been a client at the firm since October, when he contacted Bartlett about potentially defamatory material posted on YouTube. The material did not mention the rape allegation. At the time he was contacted by Porter, Bartlett was also acting for prime minister Scott Morrison in an unrelated matter. When it became clear Porter had a relationship with the firm predating the publication of the rape allegation by more than four months, Kimmitt’s critics viewed her email as even more problematic. The firm’s policy may not have required Bartlett to get approval for a matter as insignificant as advice about YouTube material, and Kimmitt had implied the decision to take the case had been made recently. Broader issues were also at play. Bartlett is the most senior lawyer at the firm, and is well respected. He has acted as a defamation lawyer for many of Australia’s major media companies. Kimmitt does not have a law degree, and her email was viewed as undermining a fundamental principle of the profession – the right to fair representation. She had not spoken with Bartlett before sending the email, which, while it did not name him, clearly identified him and was critical of his conduct. Kimmitt has championed equality for women, including addressing the gender pay gap, and has been vocal about the need for MinterEllison to be a leader in the field, but some colleagues viewed the email as evidence her passion clouded her judgment. The firm also handles tens of millions of dollars in federal government contracts. Kimmitt’s hiring in 2018 from Ernst & Young was seen as an indicator that MinterEllison wanted to muscle in on the lucrative consultancy work undertaken by Australia’s “big four” companies. By early Thursday afternoon, Kimmitt’s profile had been removed from the firm’s website. It declined to comment further about her departure. O’Brien, who chairs a board of five other men and four women, did not respond to a request for comment. Kimmitt did not respond to a request for comment. Friends and former colleagues also did not respond.\\n\",\n",

She said the company had been “thoroughly evaluated” by the health department before the contract was awarded, and it would not have access to clinical information “over what is required” to book an appointment for a Covid vaccine. “There will be very limited information,” Edwards said. “In summary, we think there has been enormous improvements made by HealthEngine – we tested these very carefully when we considered them for contract and they won’t be privy to the sort of information we would be most concerned about in any event.” The Labor senator Murray Watt asked whether the department was concerned about awarding the contract to the company, given the recent fine by Australia’s consumer regulator. Edwards said the department had taken steps to satisfy itself that the previous issues would “not affect the current contract”. Watt asked Edwards: “Why was a company, with this sort of record, preferred over other companies that had not been penalised for engaging in misleading conduct relating to sharing patient private information?” Edwards said HealthEngine was judged by officials to be the preferred provider for the service on a range of criteria.   Related: Australia's Covid vaccine rollout has begun, so how is it going and when can you get the jab?   The chair of the Senate committee, shadow finance minister Katy Gallagher, asked whether the company had been invited to pitch for the work given the tender had been awarded through a limited select process. “I believe so,” Edwards said, adding this was a “standard and appropriate” procedure. Edwards said she did not have the dollar value of the contract to hand. The ACCC says in the legal proceedings HealthEngine admitted that between 30 April 2014 and 30 June 2018 it gave non-clinical personal information, such as names, dates of birth, phone numbers, email addresses, of more than 135,000 patients to third party private health insurance brokers without adequately disclosing this to consumers. The regulator said HealthEngine had earned more than $1.8m from its arrangements with private health insurance brokers during this period. The federal court last August ordered the company to pay $2.9m in penalties for engaging in misleading conduct “in relation to the sharing of patient personal information to private health insurance brokers and publishing misleading patient reviews and ratings” the regulator said. The ACCC said the company also admitted that between 31 March 2015 and 1 March 2018, “it did not publish around 17,000 reviews and edited around 3,000 reviews to remove negative aspects, or to embellish them”. “HealthEngine also admitted that it misrepresented to consumers the reasons why it did not publish a rating for some health or medical practices,” the consumer watchdog said. During the legal action, the company said in a statement that it recognised “that our rapid growth over the years has sometimes outpaced our systems and processes and we sincerely apologise if that has meant we have not always met the high expectations of us”. The company said it was “working hard to rebuild the trust we’ve lost with patients and practices”. In the same hearing on Thursday, officials acknowledged that the Covid vaccine rollout could continue until December, despite the Morrison government declaring previously that Australian adults would be “fully vaccinated” by October. The health department secretary, Brendan Murphy, said adults would be offered a vaccine by the end of October, but it was possible they may not have the required two injections by that time. Murphy said that didn’t matter, because people would be “fully protected by the first dose”. Edwards said the end point could be December. “We are still planning and hoping to have both shots by the end of October,” she said. “In the event that we didn’t get all shots by the end of October, the second shot would be finished six weeks after the end of October”.\\n\",\n",

       "  'title': \"I'm struggling to talk to friends in lockdown. Being alone has been a relief | Naoise Dolan\",\n",
       "  'full_article': \"I haven’t socialised with anyone in six months and it is entirely my fault. I live in London and have friends within walking distance. There are many more elsewhere who I owe a Zoom. Dozens of people have messaged and I’ve been too anxious to reply; I just hope they’re thinking that I’m doing my best. As a result of my own decisions, I have not said a word aloud to someone who is not my colleague, family member or flatmate since September. And I’ve thrown up on the latter, so he’s basically family, too. Is this some bogus monastic sacrifice? Am I resistance-training for all possible levels of a future lockdown? No, I’m just autistic, and it does not take a lot to overwhelm me. There are some autistic people who rarely or never speak. That’s not me. I can usually talk when I need to. But then the decisions start. The verbal ones: when a casual acquaintance asks how I am, there are several permissible answers and all of them are lies. Say their name around as often as they say mine. When they request advice, back up the thing they’re already planning on doing, or dispense a platitude that would not withstand the mildest scrutiny. When they say “Have a good day”, say “The same to you” if they’re Irish, or “You too” if they’re not. (Possibly both replies are interchangeable, but I’ve noticed a pattern and will stick to it pending further information.) I need to script and consciously deploy all of this because I have no filter and even less autopilot.   I don't dislike people. It’s the opposite: I love everyone and I give every conversation my all, which is exhausting   Then there are non-verbal decisions. If there’s a sudden noise, I have to hide that I’m now thinking about the source and nature of said noise. When I’m really, properly listening to people, my face is blank; this often makes them think I’m bored, so I redistribute some of my concentration to intermittently changing my expression. How should I tilt my jaw? When should I tilt my jaw? Don’t fidget, though it helps me puzzle things out, because they’ll think I’m nervous and try to “help” me and then I’ll lose my train of thought. Don’t laugh, because my laughter can just as easily mean I’m sad or shocked as that I’m amused, but they mightn’t see it that way if they’re describing their grandma’s funeral. None of this is because I dislike people. Actually, it’s the opposite: I love everyone and I give every conversation my all, which is exhausting. And I don’t have to do all this because autistic people are objectively worse at communicating. I have to do all this because most non-autistic people cannot competently adapt to my way of talking, and so the burden falls on me to adapt to theirs. We’re just as good as anyone else, but we’re a widely misunderstood minority and we have to conduct ourselves accordingly. To me, the need for eye contact is bizarre. It feels way too intense when I don’t know someone well. I only look people in the eye to accommodate their needs. (You’re welcome, guys.) There’s always a tradeoff. One of my autistic friends who has known me since university was puzzled to watch as I went from doing less than her to blend in, to doing more. Neither of us had made an easy decision: “masking” your autism is not good, but it is encouraged. Hiding our real selves leads to emotional repression, an inability to be genuine with anyone, and a cognitive tax that diminishes the million more interesting things we could be doing with our minds. But society punishes us if we don’t do it. Not all autistics can mask in the first place – it certainly took me a lot of work to get any good at it – so if you do “successfully” mask, there’s also an element of survivor’s guilt, a feeling that you’re distancing yourself from everyone else on the spectrum.   Different noises, tastes, textures and temperatures need to be planned for and worked around, or else they’ll crowd my head and I might shut down   No one should want autistics to mask. It’s like making us do everything with the wrong hand. It hurts us, and robs everyone of the potential of us being ourselves. But they hate us so much that they don’t care what they’re losing, and I can’t think about that too long without getting sad. In some ways, the pandemic has lessened the pressure on me to socialise. What no one tells you about writing a book is that you’ll have to talk about it a lot. Plus there are fewer logistical nightmares when everything’s happening remotely. If I have to catch a train in the afternoon, I can’t do anything that morning; I’m too anxious and wary of becoming distracted. When I’ll be in a new venue for the first time, I look it up on Google maps and scour the website to get a feel for where everything is – a form of pre-familiarisation I had no idea was a common autism adjustment until I saw that some libraries offer it. Different noises, tastes, textures and temperatures need to be planned for and worked around, or else they’ll crowd my head and I might shut down. My organisation and sensory responses are often wildly out of sync with what’s expected of me, and the task of planning around this can feel like a full-time job in itself. I have managed to give my publisher headaches around matters like collecting bookplates and mixing up Zoom times, but I think by publishing my book during a pandemic, I have had a gentler time. That said, 2020 was for me, as for everyone, an unambiguously terrible year. I wish I could see socialising as a source of comfort. But I can’t. For me it’s more stress, anxiety and fear that I’m doing everything wrong. That’s not my friends’ fault. They can, and do, reassure me explicitly that they want me to be myself around them. The pain runs deeper than that: it’s settled in my bones that I need to mask with other people, even other autistics. My childhood taught me that, my adolescence confirmed it, and my adulthood proves it every day.  That’s why fiction is enormously important to me. Novels have always served as case studies of how most people think. The social observations of Jane Austen, Zadie Smith, Bernardine Evaristo, Edward St Aubyn, Alan Hollinghurst; they all make me stop and go: oh, that’s why. And once I understand, I can do it. Like an aspiring footballer who pauses the game, I take my time reading conversations , to work out who said what, and why. Then, when I go out and do the real thing, I’m more confident. And I do love it. That’s why I put so much work in. I’m endlessly grateful for fiction, because there’s no telling how isolated I’d feel without it. Books are why I have friends at all, even if I can’t always keep up with them. So though I have not been talking much these past few months, I have been reading a lot. And believe it or not, after six months without socialising, what finally gave me the push to do better was writing this. I saw in my own words that I was in a bad situation I had the power to change, and I’ve finally started messaging people back. So I’m looking forward to the next few weeks as lockdown lifts. When I’m ready to start again, able to finagle those long-overdue catchups, I won’t feel rusty. I’ll remember the moves, and I’ll play.

       "  'title': 'Football grapples slowly with brain injury, 19 years on from Jeff Astle | Andy Bull',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'On 11 November 2002, the South Staffordshire coroner Andrew Haigh recorded a verdict of “death by industrial disease” in the case of the former England striker Jeff Astle who had died, aged 59, after years suffering with dementia. At that point there was already 30-odd years’ worth of anecdotal evidence that heading the ball caused brain trauma. The Astle verdict meant there was now an official recognition of a link. The Guardian called it a “landmark verdict”. An official at the Professional Footballers’ Association reassured the players, and public, that the PFA and the FA had “begun joint research” into how heading a football affects the brain.  “We cannot do anything about what has gone on in the past,” the spokesman said, “but maybe we can do something about the future.”   Related: Women and girls face double the risk of concussion in sport, British MPs are told   Eighteen years into that future, on 15 October 2020, the North Wales coroner John Gittins reached the same verdict in the case of the former Wales midfielder Alan Jarvis. It was the first such case since Astle’s. Jarvis’s family said at the time that they felt the authorities had been trying to “sweep the issue under the carpet”. The Daily Mail called the case a “landmark verdict”. And in the weeks afterwards, as the relatives of more and more retired footballers spoke about how their families were suffering, an official at the PFA came forward again. The language was more urgent now, and came with a clear acknowledgment that the game had a problem, but it still ended with the promise that the union and the FA “were committed to funding further research”. Which sounded wearisomely familiar. “All scientific work is incomplete,” wrote the epidemiologist Sir Austin Bradford Hill, who was instrumental in establishing the links between smoking and lung cancer. “Whether it be observational or experimental. All scientific work is liable to be upset or modified by advancing knowledge. That does not confer upon us a freedom to ignore the knowledge that we already have, or to postpone the action that it appears to demand at a given time.”   A lot changed in those last two decades, but the question of whether sport should have gone further, faster, remains   A lot changed in those last two decades. There has been progress in football, and across all contact and collision sports, but the question of whether more could have been done sooner, whether sport should have gone further, faster, remains. It seemed to hang over the opening day of the digital, culture, media and sport committee’s inquiry into concussion in sport on Tuesday. You could hear hints of it in the MPs’ questions about who was funding the current research, and how much they were paying, whether there was material out there that hadn’t been published, about the workings of the Concussion in Sport group, and whether we need more transparency in research. It came up directly after the neuropathologist Willie Stewart described football’s current concussion substitute protocols as “a shambles”. The Astle case was 19 years ago, said the committee chair, Julian Knight. “Yet we are talking about football protocols being ‘a shambles’. Why are we letting people down in this way? What is the problem in terms of our sporting bodies?” Stewart said he shared Knight’s “frustration”, but preferred to look forward: “The challenge is not to make the same mistake again, where we all get together in 20 years’ time and say: ‘What has happened? Nothing!’”    Alan Jarvis in his Hull playing days in 1970. The verdict of death by industrial disease at his 2020 inquest was the first such verdict in the case of a footballer since Jeff Astle’s. Photograph: Colorsport/Shutterstock   This is an argument that comes up a lot in conversations with, and between, the growing number of academics, campaigners and researchers working in this field. There’s a theory that the reason the pace of change has been so slow is because the threat of litigation has put the governing authorities on the defensive, that the worry about whether they will be blamed for what they did wrong has made them reluctant to engage with suggestions about what they might do right. Advocates argue that everyone involved needs to take a more collaborative and constructive approach. It’s an idea that underpins some of the new campaign groups that have been set up in recent months, such as Head For Change. Which figures. Back is not the best way to move forward. Only it does leave a lot of awkward questions unanswered. Questions such as, to pick one of many, what became of the work published in 1998, four years before the Astle verdict, by a team of researchers working in the Netherlands under Dr Erik Matser? The Guardian reported at the time that Matser’s team had found clear evidence that “heading a football can cause long-term brain damage”. One of the co-authors explained: “The mental impairment of the players is subtle and would go unnoticed by many people, however this type of brain injury may last forever.” In the long term, though, Matser’s work didn’t lead anywhere. He has his own ideas about what happened and why, which he has spoken about in a recent interview with the Dutch newspaper NRC.   Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors’ picks.  The inquiry itself already feels too small, and underresourced, to dig into these issues in this kind of detail. Ninety minutes into the opening session the chair was already asking interviewees to “keep their answers concise” because “we’re relatively short of time”. There’s so much to cover, complicated questions of science, sociology and policy, across so many sports at youth, amateur and professional level. It has made for some awkward moments, with neurologists asked to provide expert testimony on issues of public health policy, and population psychology, and meant there have been some conspicuous gaps in the range of topics covered. It is valuable work. But, 19 years after the Astle verdict, it still feels like late in the day to be beginning all over. And we’ll have to wait and see whether, this time, it leads to a real step forward in how sport handles these issues.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': \"'I learned about storytelling from Final Fantasy': novelist Raven Leilani on Luster and video games\",\n",
       "  'full_article': 'There is an extraordinary and telling moment in Raven Leilani’s acclaimed novel Luster, about a young black woman who has an affair with a middle-aged white man and ends up living with his family. The woman, Edie, is heading back to her lover’s house with his adopted black daughter, Akila, when the pair are stopped and questioned by two police officers. Although Edie is compliant, Akila – younger and much less worldly – challenges the cops and gets thrust to the ground and restrained. The confrontation is rife with fear and tension, and when it’s over (diffused when Akila’s white mother intervenes), the first thing Edie and Akila do is go inside, sit down and play a video game. Much of the fervid discussion around Luster has focused on Leilani’s astute and witty analysis of sexual politics and racial power structures in the 21st-century US. But a key part of her acutely realised portrayal of a millennial protagonist coping with crappy jobs and crappier love affairs is Edie’s natural relationship with digital culture and technology. At a time in which video game references are still mostly consigned to YA and sci-fi books, Leilani has made them a central component of a literary novel.    ‘It has so much to do with memory’ … Final Fantasy 7. Photograph: Square Enix   She has, it turns out, been a keen video game player since she was five years old. It was her much older brother who introduced her to the Nintendo Entertainment System, the two playing titles such as Duck Hunt and Super Mario together. “He’d absolutely obliterate me,” she relates, over a Zoom call. “He was living away from home by then, so, in between his visits, I’d train so that I could beat him.” From there, she moved on to the original PlayStation. “Just booting it up, the sound it played – I still feel like I have that sound in my head,” she says. “I started playing Tekken and Street Fighter. Me and my cousins would gather round the console and get really involved in the stories. It was how I learned to relate to other people, emotionally.” The games she really loved were Japanese role-playing adventures – especially the Final Fantasy series. In Luster, Edie is evicted from her New York apartment at the beginning of her affair with middle-aged archivist Eric – it’s his wife, Rebecca, who insists on taking Edie into the home. It is through video games that Edie copes with this weird domestic dynamic, playing a fantasy adventure of Leilani’s own invention, about an amnesiac army mail clerk trying to find his family. “It’s totally a Final Fantasy rip-off!” she admits. “I was hoping for it to feel familiar to readers. I definitely lean heavily on Final Fantasy VII as the main reference point, especially as that game has so much to do with memory – it gave me a portal to talk about Edie and Akila’s formative contexts.”   When you’re a part of a fandom, there is love but also a sense of ownership and discernment about the games you like   Leilani drew on her own experience as a preteen geek, into games and comics, to depict Akila’s fandom. Living with white parents in a white suburb, the character feels alienated and marginalised, but role-playing games provide her with worlds in which she gets to be the central component. “When I wrote Akila, I was writing toward that younger version of myself – when you’re a part of a fandom and you love something so much, there is love but also a sense of ownership and discernment about the games you like and the games you feel other people shouldn’t like. Akila and Edie have their own tastes, but they are able to bond and find communion through gaming.” Many readers will recognise that communal experience. RPGs are almost always single-player games, but a lot of us play with friends, shouting instructions to the person holding the controller. “I grew up playing them in a room full of my cousins and friends,” says Leilani, “and we identified with different characters in the party. So when I was writing those scenes that’s what I was trying to replicate – that feeling of being on a fantasy journey with another person and the way that can parallel the development of an interpersonal relationship.”    Luster – which has been longlisted for the Women’s prize for fiction – is incredibly interesting in the way it explores the serrated boundaries between reality and fantasy. Edie’s relationship with Eric is an unrealistic construct that began as an online dalliance, and the strange domestic arrangement they find themselves in – an awkward open marriage that becomes an interracial nuclear family – is a fantasy, too, as ad-hoc, experimental and fabricated as a household in The Sims. The climax of the book takes place at a Comic-Con event – another highly fabricated fantasy space. Amid all this unreality, Akila’s gaming sessions with Edie are about the only emotionally real thing going on. There’s a lovely scene where Akila wakes Edie in the middle of the night and tells her she thinks she’s solved one of the game’s big puzzles. She then carefully observers Edie playing the game, watching how she interacts with non-player characters, as a kind of test of her empathy. When she sees Edie being kind in the game, she removes the wig she’s been wearing and shows that she has burned her scalp applying sodium hydroxide. It is a starkly personal revelation: she has no one to help her with her hair. “Video games allow a different kind of vulnerability,” says Leilani. “When you’re playing with another person, the engagement you have with the character, the story, the journey – it makes for a collaborative, communal experience that Edie and Akila are desperately searching for. It’s also worth noting that these are two black women who move through the world with that layer of self-protection who are gravitating toward this safe space. The fantasy game provides a place for them to relate to each other where they don’t have to be concerned with the curated self.” So, that’s why it is so important, in that terrifying scene with the police officers, that it is video games the two characters turn to. “Games are not simply an escape from the real world, they’re a place to process what has happened in the real world,” says Leilani. “That’s how it has worked for me. I’m extremely introverted and I’m naturally inclined to more solitary activities. I want to be sucked into an experience.”   Related: Luster by Raven Leilani review – a millennial novel for the ages   When I ask Leilani if playing Final Fantasy has influenced her approach to storytelling, she nods enthusiastically. Luster is filled with beautiful, intricate observations – she places brand names, specific disco songs and other cultural artefacts with the exactness of an artist setting up a still life painting. This, she says, is something she learned from RPGs. “You follow a character on this journey of self-discovery, and I like the work that it entails. I like going into villagers’ houses and finding what’s there, I like talking to NPCs and exhausting my options. I love being rewarded for that attention and rigour … It’s hard to articulate the magic of a world that responds to you in that way. “RPGs represent something that is central to making art, which is data collection and attention. You have to be rigorous and curious – because curiosity, too, is central to art,” she says. “You have to seek out the gifts that are built into the world. Playing those games and seeing how they work and knowing how to advance not just the game but the character in their journey, helped give me patience for the accumulation of small epiphanies and small interactions. “All of it means something – that’s the most succinct way I can put it. Small things matter.”\\n',\n",

       "  'title': \"Carl Frampton: 'People say you shouldn’t care about how others see you but I do'\",\n",
       "  'full_article': \"Carl Frampton’s refusal to play down the momentous consequences of victory against Jamel Herring is an endearing break from sporting convention. The Belfast boxer exudes confidence and conviction about the prospect of becoming a world champion in three weight divisions when he faces Herring on the rearranged date of 3 April. “It’s massive,” says Frampton. “I am already very proud of what I’ve done in my career but to become a three-weight world champion … nobody on the island of Ireland has ever done that, you would join an elite list of British fighters that have done it. It would be special. Imagine your kids being able to say in 20 years’ time that their da’ was a three-weight world champion. It’s huge for me, it really is.   Related: Carl Frampton: 'I genuinely know I can be a world champion again'   “There’s just something different about this one. I have a real belief that I’m going to beat this guy. That’s not me taking him for granted, I just have a strong confidence that I’m going to win. I’m really up for it and I believe I’ll win the fight. I don’t believe in destiny and all that stuff but this just feels right. It’s much more of a legacy-defining fight for me than it is for him. I feel like it’s going to happen.” Frampton’s brand of self-analysis is fascinating. By rights he can already consider his achievements on a global stage worthy of great satisfaction. It feels as if turning 34 recently somehow intensifies his drive. That and, perhaps, the lofty status Northern Ireland affords its sporting legends. “People say you shouldn’t care too much about how others see you but I do,” he says. “I want to be remembered very fondly as a good fighter, a good person. I want to be remembered a very long time from now. I’m not consumed by vanity but I don’t want to be a flash in the pan, where people forget about my achievements.”    Josh Warrington and Carl Frampton exchange punches during their title fight in December 2018. Photograph: Alex Livesey/Getty Images   Little more than two years ago, Frampton considered his boxing in the past tense. Defeat against Josh Warrington triggered what ultimately – and thankfully – wasn’t defining dejection. “In my head for two weeks I was a retired fighter,” Frampton recalls. “Then I just sat down and had a think rationally about things. It wasn’t a case of me being over the hill, it was a bad performance on the night and that happens at the top level in sport. I thought it would be a shame to end my career on a sour note like that. I felt like I could win another world title again. I wouldn’t have come back if I didn’t have that belief. I’m within touching distance of it now.” He admits that one day, in the not-so-distant future, the show will indeed have to stop. “Thirty was the age I wanted to retire at for a long time. A lot of that was down to not enjoying boxing. I don’t want to go on too long, I won’t be boxing at 40, I don’t even think I’ll be boxing at 36, so I’m not too far from the end. Still a wee bit left to give but not too much more. “I haven’t been in too many brutal fights but the training camps take it out of you. They have a massive impact on your body. I want to have a long life after boxing with my wife and kids. Wear and tear and the brutality of training camps take their toll. I genuinely believe the real hard training camps could take years off your life. It’s so intense.” Concussion injuries, such a key theme across sport now, resonate with Frampton far more than they did in his youth. “You just mature and understand things a bit more. I’ve adapted my training methods, I don’t spar as much as I used to.”    Carl Frampton with Barry McGuigan in front of his mural at the Midland Boxing Club in Tiger’s Bay, Belfast, before the pair fell out. Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian   Frampton’s next phase – he is already a popular pundit – will be far less agonising. “I’d say two weeks after my last fight, I won’t ever have a six-pack again in my life. I struggle to put my socks on in the morning. That’s what happens when you don’t start stretching until you reach 30.” If Covid and a hand injury have obscured the buildup to the Jackal’s latest return, there was an added level of complexity. A lengthy court battle between Frampton and Barry McGuigan, another of Irish boxing’s favourite sons, was concluded in November. McGuigan had been Frampton’s long-time manager. In a recent podcast Frampton said of McGuigan and his sons that he “wouldn’t piss on them if they were on fire”, and he insists now: “I wouldn’t take that statement back. There was genuine trust there for a long time. I loved these people, they were groomsmen at my wedding, I was groomsman at Shane McGuigan’s wedding. “It’s an absolute shame what happened but it is what it is. That’s life, I suppose. I can laugh about it. I just don’t want to have anything to do with these people anymore but it’s not as if I’m sitting here seething every day. The relationship is dead. I’m not going to dwell on it. It’s done.   Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors’ picks.  “I was actually starting to enjoy court, going down there every day having been cross-examined – I was happy with how that went – and watching other people having the same. There were a lot of funny incidents. I had mates watching it via a link most days and they were really upset when the settlement happened, they had nothing else to do again.” Still, Frampton in hindsight feels “a weight was lifted” by the case ending. The elephant in the ring now relates to management matters of a different kind, with the suspected crime boss Daniel Kinahan’s attachment to the sport the subject of a recent Panorama documentary. Frampton is registered with MTK, the firm with which Kinahan has been associated. “I don’t really want to talk about it,” says Frampton. “It’s ‘investigative journalism’ but I don’t know how much investigation was done.” Frampton is dismissive rather than remotely uneasy on the subject.   Related: Dillian Whyte: 'I was born in a storm. Adversity is the story of my life'   Frampton understandably backs away from traces of negativity. The scale of his cross-community support in Northern Ireland, for example, has had an impact beyond boxing. He smiles when recalling, aged 11, spending six weeks with a family in Texas as part of a project for working-class youngsters. “People thought Northern Ireland was thatched roof cottages and men running about the streets with guns. That’s the impression they had. “There is always a bit of tension bubbling under the surface and I don’t think the politicians do us any favours. There is still a green or orange vote and we are a generation away from ruling that out. But it is a much better place than when I was a kid. And when I was growing up in Belfast, it was a much better place than when my dad was growing up in Belfast. We are getting there.” Frampton has dedicated almost 30 years of his life to boxing. “If someone had told me I’d win a world title then lost it in my first defence, I’d have taken that.

       "  'title': \"Dinamo Zagreb's Zoran Mamic: master coach or criminal – or both? | Aleksandar Holiga\",\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Dinamo Zagreb’s Zoran Mamic, unbeaten in eight games, is one of the most successful managers in this season’s Europa League. His side won a difficult group with CSKA Moscow, Feyenoord and Wolfsberger, conceding only one goal on the way, then eliminated Krasnodar in the round of 32 last month, winning the home and away legs.   Related: José Mourinho wants a trophy for Spurs chairman Levy to mark 1,000th game   Now the Croatian champions face Tottenham in the first leg of the round of 16 on Thursday and the general feeling at home is they might stand a chance. They have a host of in-form players – such as Mislav Orsic, Bruno Petkovic and Arijan Ademi – and feel that they can go one step further than reaching the last 16 two years ago. Then they lost against Benfica but before that they had been unable to qualify for the knockout rounds for almost half a century. Not a bad turn of events for Mamic, who could have just as easily been spending this time behind bars rather than on the Dinamo bench. Or, perhaps, fleeing justice like his brother Zdravko, for many years the most powerful figure in Croatian football, who is at large in Bosnia and Herzegovina. There are not many stories about the domestic game in Croatia in foreign media that does not mention the name Mamic, especially in the past few years after a set of corruption and tax evasion charges were raised against the brothers. The subsequent trial attracted much public attention with the likes of Luka Modric and Dejan Lovren testifying in court. Modric’s testimony, in particular, created headlines because it led to an indictment for perjury against the Real Madrid player and 2018 Ballon d’Or winner, which was later dropped.    Zdravko Mamic (second right) and his brother Zoran (right) leave the court of Bosnia and Herzegovina after an extradition hearing on 15 June 2018. Photograph: Elvis Barukcic/AFP/Getty Images   In June 2018, the Osijek county court found the Mamics guilty on all charges, the cornerstone of which was making illegal personal profits on player transfers from Dinamo, where they held key executive positions – including the 2008 Modric transfer to Tottenham. The decision is only final upon appeal and after it is confirmed by the superior court but Croatian law specifies that jail terms are effective immediately for any sentence of five years or higher. Zdravko fled Croatia on the eve of the verdict which gave him six and a half years in jail and has been in Bosnia and Herzegovina since; he holds dual citizenship and the country is not obliged to extradite him. He later claimed on his Facebook page that he had been tipped off by a former football referee, who had “accidentally overheard” some judges discussing the verdict in his case that day. Zoran, at the time the head coach at the United Arab Emirates club Al Ain FC, was given four years and 11 months, just enough for him not to have to go to jail immediately. The courts in Croatia tend to move at a snail’s pace. This year, more than 30 months after the verdict, the superior court finally held a hearing in the Mamic case. The prosecution asked for stricter punishments, while the defendants have continued to deny all charges and are asking for them to be dropped altogether. The final decision is still to be announced. Zoran has returned to Dinamo, the club insisting there was no financial damage done, suggesting Zdravko is still very much in control of the club. Besides, laying low or seeking the moral high ground was never the Mamic way. A year after being found guilty of siphoning off money from the club, Zoran was appointed Dinamo’s director of football. By the end of last season, he took over as manager. Maintaining he was completely innocent, he stated his intention to concentrate on football.    The Mamic’s were found guilty of making profits on players from Dinamo including Luka Modric’s move to Tottenham in 2008. Photograph: Greig Cowie/Shutterstock   At a press conference upon his return to the club in 2019 he told reporters: “It’s a good question, what is moral? Many of you and your colleagues have judged me already. The verdict is not final yet and the basis of our system is the presumption of innocence.” After a difficult start for their European ambitions – failing to qualify for the Champions League, which was their main target for the season – Dinamo’s form has improved. They kicked off their Europa League group stage with two goalless draws, but then won six matches in a row and have been playing well recently. Zoran has done a very good job in his second stint as Dinamo manager and that was enough to silence some of the critics. However, his bizarre position and his legal problems remain a concern. While he is waiting for the court’s final decision, which could see him dismissed from the club before the end of the season – or, indeed, even before their European campaign is over – he has another set of charges to deal with.   The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.  Last Wednesday a new trial against the Mamic brothers and their associates finally began after no less than eight postponements for various reasons. The new charges mainly concentrate on various off-shore accounts used to extract more money from transfers of Dinamo players. That day, Dinamo had a cup game against Slaven Belupo in the afternoon, but Zoran needed to spend the entire morning in court, listening to the indictment being read for more than two hours. So is he a football mastermind – “a Coach with a capital C”, which is how Dinamo put it on their social networks after beating Krasnodar – or just a plain criminal? Or both at the same time? Forces other than José Mourinho and his Spurs side will give the final verdict on that.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'Post-Covid Britain needs a new social guarantee | Anna Coote and Neal Lawson',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'As Britain’s economy and society gradually reopen, we face big questions about what should come next. The chancellor has promised tax rises and spending cuts. Without a radical response, increases in poverty, unemployment and inequality will be inevitable outcomes of the Covid crisis. What’s needed now is a social guarantee that enshrines every person’s right to life’s essentials. Most people will agree what these essentials are: education, healthcare, a decent home, care, food, clean air and water, energy, transport and (these days) access to the internet. To ensure everyone has these essentials, people must have a fair living income and access to public services that meet their needs. We expect to pay for some necessities ourselves. Food is an obvious example, so everyone must have enough money to afford a nutritious diet. There are other essentials that most of us couldn’t afford on our own. Think of education, healthcare, childcare and adult social care. Here, we ensure everyone has access by sharing responsibility, pooling resources and acting together. Without providing these services collectively through public institutions, we would need vast amounts of cash to meet all of our needs. Some people in policy circles have spent too long arguing whether “universal basic income” (UBI) or “universal basic services” (UBS) ought to be our preferred goal. But in fact we need both. Without public services, many people wouldn’t be able to afford to pay for their healthcare or education, and without a guaranteed income floor below which nobody can fall, far too many people would be condemned to poverty.   Related: Californians on universal basic income paid off debt and got full-time jobs   It’s best to think of these things as two sides of a coin. On one side, we want to make sure that everyone has a secure and sufficient income. This would minimise the humiliation of claiming benefits, and reflect the reality that peoples’ income levels vary dramatically according to their different jobs, needs and conditions. This calls for generous cash payments available according to need, through a system that is open-hearted and empowering, not hostile or begrudging. On the other side of the coin are the services that are essential to live a good life, which people don’t pay for directly. These are worth much more to people on low incomes, so they help to reduce inequalities. They’ve been gravely undermined by a decade of austerity and will be in even greater danger if the vast costs of Covid-19 are used to justify more spending cuts. So they need defending, extending and transforming. It’s not a matter of which option is preferable, but rather how each of them is realised in practice, and how they fit together and support each other. A guaranteed income floor (one version of UBI) can be combined with more and better public services to provide secure foundations for everyone to flourish. For that to work, the income floor must be set at a level that is sufficient, without absorbing public funds needed to maintain and improve services. There’s no “magic bullet” for solving problems such as deepening poverty, widening inequalities, rising unemployment and the threats of future pandemics and climate breakdown. But we can make a decent start if we enhance public services and integrate them with a basic income as part of a new social guarantee. This guarantee would give everyone the right to a secure and sufficient income and to the services that meet their needs, regardless of their ability to pay. It wouldn’t be a top-down, uniform model. Services would be delivered through a wide range of organisations, from local councils and social enterprises to co-ops and charities. But all providers would be bound by the same set of principles and an obligation to serve the public interest. People who use services, and public service workers, would be fully involved in planning and delivering them. Meanwhile, the main role of the state would be to ensure everyone has equal access to these things, to set and enforce standards, collect and distribute funds and coordinate different services to get the best results for those who need them. This is a radical programme, but it’s also a pragmatic one. It can be implemented in stages, and questions such as which services people need most and what level of income is sufficient can be worked out democratically. Most importantly, a system that integrates cash and in-kind benefits will have transformative impacts. For one thing, it’s highly redistributive. It would build a sense of shared responsibility and solidarity, because everyone contributes and everyone benefits. It would generate relatively secure public-sector employment at all skill levels, and would encourage the efficient use of public resources. And because this social guarantee involves shared responsibility and collective action, rather than purely market-based transactions, it would be more able to support a concerted approach to climate action and ecological sustainability. So it’s time for progressives to throw their weight behind a social guarantee that combines income and services. A post-Covid society demands this level of vision, ambition and collaborative endeavour.

       "  'title': \"'Ecological island': as Maasai herding lands shrink, so does space for Kenya's elephants\",\n",
       "  'full_article': \"Kenyan elephants risk a slow extinction in a bleak, ever-shrinking “ecological island” in one of the country’s most picturesque and photographed landscapes, according to a government report. The animals face a grim future as habitat loss is exacerbated by the pandemic’s impact on tourism, which is pushing landowners to sell off areas for development, and a growing trend towards a sedentary lifestyle among the pastoralist Maasai people, says the new 10-year management plan. Increased and unregulated grazing in the Amboseli national park is destroying plant and animal diversity, aggravating conflicts between humans and wildlife and intensifying the negative effects of climate crisis with flooding and drought. If nothing is done urgently to secure the ecosystem, the report says, the park risks becoming an “ecological island”, confining the 1,800 elephants that live there into a tight circle of five animals to each square kilometre as opposed to their basic survival threshold of one elephant to every square kilometre.    A herd of cows returning from a watering hole with Kilimanjaro in the distance, Amboseli national park. Photograph: Buena Vista Images/Getty Images   Amboseli includes the 39,200 hectare national park – one of the most photographed landscapes in Africa, where elephants and other wildlife are framed by the backdrop of Kilimanjaro – and seven group ranches belonging to the Maasai community that cover 506,329 hectares. It is the constant subdivision of this land into smaller parcels and their possible change of use into commercial ventures that conservationists fear will lead to loss of wildlife dispersal areas and close corridors used by animals to visit adjacent conservation areas, such as Tsavo and Kilimanjaro. “Isolation of the park from the rest of the ecosystem would have adverse impacts on wildlife populations and tourism in the area. If the park is isolated, there would be less wildlife species diversity, which would necessitate a reduction of elephant numbers, while 15% biomass potential of wildlife in the ranches could be lost,” says the management plan.    A giraffe crosses a road within the Kimana sanctuary, part of a wildlife corridor that links the Amboseli national park to the Chyulu Hills and Tsavo protected areas. Photograph: Thomas Mukoya/Reuters   It is not just the elephants that face imminent danger. Four other inhabitants of Amboseli: the Maasai giraffe, lion, cheetah and hippo are on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of threatened species. Amboseli is also one of the 62 important bird areas (IBAs) in Kenya and a member of Unesco’s global network of biosphere reserves. Of the 503 bird species recorded in the park, 17 are on IUCN’s Red List. According to the management plan, elephants in Amboseli act to balance the larger ecosystem, boosting the survival of diverse species. For example, the elephants have traditionally used a southern corridor to connect with others on the northern slopes of Kilimanjaro. But it is closing fast as commercial farming increases, with the report warning of “imminent extinction of species”. “Connecting Amboseli national park and Kilimanjaro forest on the Tanzanian side is a narrow strip of land, the Kitenden Corridor, which allows wildlife movement, and particularly elephant movement, between the two protected areas. The Amboseli populations may act as an important gene pool, particularly for the small population of eland in the moorland and alpine zones of Kilimanjaro, which might be prone to natural extinction if passage through the corridor is blocked,” says the plan.

Photograph: Thomas Mukoya/Reuters   Jackson Mwato is the executive director of the Amboseli Ecosystem Trust, an umbrella body which is championing the cause of more than 27,000 landowners, but with an eye on sustainability. In February, Mwato brought together conservation officials and landowners to discuss the development of an action plan, a measure they hope will lead to the survival of the wildlife animals and improve Maasai livelihoods.   Related: Budget cuts and collapse in tourism revenue pose 'severe' threat to nature   “These people are central to the survival of the Amboseli ecosystem,” Mwato told the Guardian. “They have grazed their cattle in the midst of wildlife in land that was collectively owned for decades. Now they are subdividing the land and getting individual land ownership documents. What happens next will make or break conservation.” Mwato says that for local people to benefit economically from the land, a programme where specific blocks are earmarked for grazing, conservation and tourism, cultivation, human settlement and other forms of infrastructure needs to be in place. However, for some owners the money has been too tempting and they’ve opted to lease their newly registered land to big commercial enterprises from outside the area.

A lone zebra stands motionless, oblivious to the whistling of a Maasai boy herding cattle into nearby lush pasture grounds. This illustrates the harmonies of life in Amboseli. On the opposite side of the road is a fenced farm – about 1,000 acres – where dozens of employees are hard at work sorting horticultural produce for the export market. Refrigerated trucks taking fresh produce from here to the airport in Nairobi, 240km away, are now more common than the tourist vehicles that used to throng the area before Covid. For local Maasai who feel they benefited little from the proceeds of tourism despite the wildlife on their land, leasing land to such businesses seems a viable option. “Such landowners feel that leasing their newly registered parcels of land to investors makes sense. For example, a person with 60 acres in a wildlife conservancy might earn 30,000 Kenyan shillings (£200) a year in lease fees. In the current situation where there is only a trickle of tourists due to coronavirus, even that amount may not be guaranteed. But in comparison, leasing out the land for commercial farming brings the same amount of money per acre. That is why some will opt to lease out their land for such activities,” says Mwato.    A Maasai herder lets his cattle graze alongside a large herd of wildebeest. Photograph: AfriPics.com/Alamy   Still, conservationists feel that if land subdivision is handled well, it can breathe some life into the endangered ecosystem. Evan Mkala, the International Fund for Animal Welfare’s (IFAW) programme manager for the region says: “The Maasai have always opened up their land to wildlife despite the amorphous group ranch arrangement. With direct ownership of the land, they have legal authority to set up wildlife conservancies, create proper governance structures and lay the groundwork for community infrastructure development.” Since 2010, IFAW has been signing land lease agreements with pastoralists to safeguard a wildlife corridor between Amboseli and Kilimanjaro. Mwato and his team at Amboseli Ecosystem Trust hope that more landowners will embrace the conservancy model and save the fragile ecosystem. “No tourism investor will come when all the space for wildlife has been converted to agriculture,” says Mwato. But what if more of Amboseli is turned over to agriculture? “We can say goodbye to conservation. We will have to describe how an elephant used to look to our future generations.”\\n\",\n",

       "  'title': 'The Code Breaker by Walter Isaacson review – a science page-turner ',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'One of the most striking passages in Walter Isaacson’s new book comes towards the end. It is 2019 and a scientific meeting is under way at the famous Cold Spring Harbour Laboratory in New York State, but James Watson, the co-discoverer of the structure of DNA, is banned from it because of the racist and scientifically unfounded views he has expressed on intelligence. Isaacson, who is to interview Watson, therefore has to make his way to the house on the nearby campus that the scientist has been allowed to keep. When the conversation sails dangerously close to the race issue, someone shouts from the kitchen: “If you are going to let him say these things, then I am going to have to ask you to leave.” The 91-year-old Watson shrugs and changes tack. The voice from the kitchen belonged to Rufus, Watson’s middle-aged son who suffers from schizophrenia. “My dad’s statements might make him out to be a bigot and discriminatory,” he once said. “They just represent his rather narrow interpretation of genetic destiny.” In many ways, Isaacson observes, Rufus is wiser than his father. Genetic destiny is a central theme of The Code Breaker, Isaacson’s portrait of the gene-editing pioneer Jennifer Doudna, who, with a small army of other scientists, handed humanity the first really effective tools to shape it. Rufus Watson’s reflections encapsulate the ambivalence that many people feel about this. If we had the power to rid future generations of diseases such as schizophrenia, would we? The immoral choice would be not to, surely? What if we could enhance healthy human beings, by editing out imperfections? The nagging worry – which might one day seem laughably luddite, even cruel – is that we would lose something along with those diseases and imperfections, in terms of wisdom, compassion and, in some way that is harder to define, humanity.    Emmanuelle Charpentier, who shared the Nobel prize in chemistry with Doudna. Photograph: Peter Steffen/AP   Doudna contributed to the identification of Crispr, a system that evolved in bacteria over billions of years to fend off invading viruses. Crispr-Cas9, to give it its proper name, disarms viruses by slicing up their DNA. Bacteria invented it, but the insight that won Doudna – a biochemist at the University of California, Berkeley – the Nobel prize in chemistry last year, along with French microbiologist Emmanuelle Charpentier, was that it could be adapted to edit genes in other organisms, including humans. The paper that sealed the duo’s fame was published in 2012, when Charpentier was working at Umeå University in Sweden. By the beginning of 2020, two dozen human trials were under way for medical applications of the technique – for conditions from cancers to atherosclerosis to a congenital form of blindness. The Crispr story is made for the movies. It features a nail-biting race, more than its fair share of renegades, the highest prize in chemistry, a gigantic battle over patents, designer babies and acres of ethical quicksand. It presents a challenge to a biographer, however, who has to pick one character from a cast of many to carry that story. Isaacson chose Doudna, and you can understand why. Having helped to elucidate the basic science of Crispr, she remains implicated in its clinical applications and in the ethical debate it stimulated – unlike Charpentier, who has said that she doesn’t want to be defined by Crispr and is now pursuing other science questions. Doudna is the thread that holds the story together. Still, you can’t help wondering how that story might have read if it had been told from the point of view of Francisco Mojica, the Spanish scientist who first spotted Crispr in bacteria inhabiting salt ponds in the 1990s. He intuited that it did something important, then doggedly pursued this line of research despite a lack of funding and the fact that everyone told him he was wasting his time. A different story again might have been told via the two French food scientists who realised in 2007 that Crispr could be harnessed to vaccinate bacteria against viruses, thus securing the future of the global yoghurt industry, or the Lithuanian biochemist Virginijus Šikšnys, who moved the story on again, but whose work was rejected by top journals. Each one made an essential contribution, and it’s difficult to say whose, if any, was the most important. A similar dilemma preoccupied Carl Djerassi and Roald Hoffmann in their 2001 play Oxygen, which asked who should receive a “Retro-Nobel” for the discovery of the eponymous gas. Should it go to the scientist who discovered oxygen but didn’t publish his discovery, the one who published but failed to understand the discovery’s significance, or the one who grasped its significance but only thanks to the insights of the other two? Focusing on Doudna also paints the Crispr story as more American than it was. Doudna herself acknowledged its international dimension, in her own account, A Crack in Creation (2017). “All told, we would be quite the international group,” she wrote of the team that produced the seminal 2012 paper, “a French professor in Sweden, a Polish student in Austria, a German student, a Czech postdoc, and an American professor in Berkeley”. The fact that her Czech postdoc and Charpentier’s Polish student had grown up close to each other – either side of a border – and that both spoke Polish, reinforced the group’s synergy and sped the writing of the paper.   Isaacson understands the tensions that drive discovery and how flawed brilliant people can be   It was precisely because so many people contributed, and because they disagree about the significance and primacy of their contributions, that they remain entangled in a row over ownership. The Crispr revolution owes a great deal to America and the premium it places on creativity and innovation, but as with so many scientific breakthroughs, there was an element of convergence – of people independently and more-or-less simultaneously arriving at the same insight. (Isaacson suggests radar and the atomic bomb were American inventions too, but radar was developed in many countries in the run-up to the second world war, while European refugees from that war helped build the bomb.) It’s not only the discovery process that is collective. As soon as a discovery is made public an even wider circle of people will apply it, and they may not have the same priorities. It’s easy and right to condemn Chinese maverick He Jiankui for editing the genes of twins Lulu and Nana, supposedly to protect them from HIV infection, but in his impassioned reply to Doudna’s criticism of his act there seems buried a grain of truth. “You don’t understand China,” he told her. “There’s an incredible stigma about being HIV positive, and I wanted to give these people a chance at a normal life ...” Genetic destiny means different things to different people, as Rufus Watson understands. Isaacson, who is best known for his lives of Steve Jobs and Leonardo da Vinci, remains a consummate portraitist. He captures the frontier spirit of Harvard geneticist George Church in an anecdote about how, when Church was a child, his physician stepfather let him administer hormone injections to his female patients (Church has been testing experimental Covid-19 vaccines on himself lately). Isaacson also has a privileged vantage point, knowing the Crispr backstory and the personalities that shaped it. In 2000, as editor of Time, he put the two men leading competing efforts to sequence the human genome – Francis Collins and Craig Venter – on the cover. He understands the tensions that drive discovery and how flawed brilliant people can be. This story was always guaranteed to be a page-turner in his hands. It’s just that science has outgrown biography as a medium. His subject should have been Crispr, not Doudna. • The Code Breaker: Jennifer Doudna, Gene Editing, and the Future of the Human Race is published by Simon & Schuster (£30).

       "  'title': \"Government walks away from promise to 'fully vaccinate' all Australians by October\",\n",
       "  'full_article': \"Federal Labor has accused the Morrison government of reneging on its commitment Australians will be “fully vaccinated” by October, after health department officials conceded some people may only have had one dose by then. Officials told the Senate’s Covid-19 inquiry that supply constraints and the longer 12-week window between AstraZeneca doses meant some may have to wait until December to get their second shot. The Labor chair of the committee, Katy Gallagher, said the evidence on Thursday contradicted the “clear language” from the prime minister, Scott Morrison, and the health minister, Greg Hunt, of full vaccination by October. But the health department secretary, Prof Brendan Murphy, claimed it was a “semantic debate” that “doesn’t really matter” because people would receive protection against Covid-19 from the first dose.   Related: Australia's Covid vaccine rollout has begun, so how is it going and when can you get the jab?   In December, Hunt promised Australians would be “fully vaccinated” by October. But the government began to shift its language because clinical studies found AstraZeneca, the backbone of Australia’s vaccination program, was more effective when given 12 weeks apart, not the four weeks the original timetable was based on. When AstraZeneca was given full approval in February, Hunt said that “every Australian who seeks to have the vaccine will be in a position to have had at least the first dose” but the government would consider “what it means in regards to the second dose”. On Tuesday, the secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, Phil Gaetjens, told the committee he understood the commitment to mean both doses would be given by the deadline. On Thursday, Morrison said the “full adult population” would be vaccinated by October. But Murphy and Caroline Edwards, the health department associate secretary, confirmed this meant only the first dose. “We are still planning and hoping to have both shots by the end of October,” Edwards told the committee on Thursday. “In the event that we didn’t get all shots by the end of October, the second shot would be finished six weeks after the end of October.” Edwards said there was “no end” to the program, so those turning 18 or who previously did not consent may be added to the program after October, which Labor’s Murray Watt suggested could push vaccinations into 2022. The officials blamed supply delays, such as Italy blocking 250,000 doses, the new 12-week gap between doses, and possible interruptions such as the need to redirect the vaccination rollout towards places with an outbreak. Murphy said the federal government believed it would have 3.8m AstraZeneca doses by now but “we’ve only had 700,000” due to “sovereign vaccine issues in Europe”. “So that vaccine supply has been a significant issue.” By late March, CSL is expected to produce 1m doses of AstraZeneca a week locally, and the government is pressing it to increase production further, Murphy said. Murphy conceded that “fully vaccinated” does refer to completing a program of both doses, but argued “in terms of protection the first dose is fully protective”. “Every Australian adult will be offered a vaccine by the end of October. “If a small number haven’t had their second AstraZeneca that doesn’t really matter, they are fully protected by the first dose. It is entirely consistent with what the prime minister and minister have said in the media.” Australia’s vaccination rollout is ambitious, requiring at least 180,000 vaccinations a day, a rate higher than most countries are achieving. The Australian Medical Association has said the government is unlikely to achieve its target of October and a more realistic target would be December due to a shortage of vaccine supply. With just 125,000 doses given so far, the federal government has already abandoned its interim target of 4m by the end of March. Also on Thursday, health authorities in Victoria revealed that a resident of an aged-care home had returned a weak positive result for Covid-19. The resident of Epping Gardens Aged Care caught the virus during Melbourne’s second wave outbreak last year when 240 staff and residents at the facility tested positive and 38 people died. A spokeswoman from the department of health said the result was likely to be due to viral shedding rather than reinfection – but precautionary measures have been put in place. The Department of Defence separately confirmed members of HMAS Sydney experienced “mild side-effects” after receiving the Covid-19 vaccine. The ABC reported that crew members were admitted to St Vincent’s hospital in Sydney as a precaution after experiencing side-effects from the vaccine. In a statement, the department said no members of the ship were currently in hospital, but would not comment on whether any crew had previously been admitted.   Related: End of December more realistic target for all Australians to get Covid vaccine, AMA says   A Defence spokesperson said the ship’s crew had voluntarily received the vaccine ahead of a deployment to North America. The ship sailed with its full crew on Thursday. “In accordance with Department of Health guidelines, members of the ship’s company were encouraged to report to medical personnel if they were feeling unwell after their vaccination. Some members experienced mild side-effects, which were resolved shortly after reporting,” a Defence spokesperson said. “It is not unusual to experience mild side-effects after any vaccination. Serious allergic reactions are rare.” Earlier, Australia’s chief medical officer, Prof Paul Kelly, told the Senate inquiry he had been notified of adverse events, but aside from “a few cases of anaphylaxis” there was “nothing untoward” in side-effects from the vaccine. “There have been some deaths following immunisation but not related to the immunisation,” Kelly said. “We’ve seen three cases of severe allergic reactions, but they were handled expertly and quickly, with no ongoing adverse effects.” Other adverse events are relatively minor and include pain at the injection site, some fever, body pain, headache, Kelly said, but “nothing untoward”. Murphy said the “unfortunate narrative” that the Pfizer vaccine was more effective than AstraZeneca “is now dead” because they are “equally efficacious”. “There is no difference between their efficacy. Both are incredibly effective at prevent severe Covid, hospitalisation, and death.”\\n\",\n",

Yet governments are standing by while Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are dying under their watch, in their prisons, police cells and during police pursuits.” Natsils said it supported the 15 families whose loved ones had died in custody behind a petition “urging prime minister Scott Morrison to meet with them face to face for the 30 year anniversary of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody”.   Related: Indigenous leaders accuse ACT of trying to cover up strip-search of sexual assault survivor   Victorian Greens senator Lidia Thorpe described the justice system as “deeply racist” following news that an Aboriginal man died in Victoria’s Ravenhall Correctional Centre on Sunday 7 March. In New South Wales, a man in his 30s and a woman in her 50s also died in custody in the past week, but their deaths were only revealed under questioning during a state parliamentary hearing two days ago. “This is relentless and traumatising for our people,” Thorpe said. “The system is broken. Thirty years on since the royal commission, how is it possible that our people are still dying in custody and not a single person or institution has been held to account? When will we have peace?”Thorpe said Morrison was refusing to meet with grieving families to explain how the deaths were possible. “That’s how little this government cares about anyone except themselves.” The Victorian man’s death was reported to the coroner. Corrections Victoria said his family had been notified and a smoking ceremony arranged. “We recognise that all deaths in custody have impacts on family members, friends, corrections staff and the Aboriginal community and we’re working to ensure they are provided with the support they need,” Corrections Victoria said in a statement. First Peoples’ Assembly of Victoria co-chair Geraldine Atkinson said the solution to preventing deaths in custody had been known since the 1991 royal commission.   Related: Victoria launches truth commission into ongoing effect of violent colonisation on Aboriginal people   “For 30 years, governments have failed to act on these recommendations – inaction that has cost the lives of over 450 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people,” Atkinson, a Bangerang and Wiradjuri woman, said. “In Victoria, Aboriginal people are imprisoned at rates 12 times higher than the rest of the population. We are dying 10 years younger. This system is killing our people and it has to stop.” News of the Victoria death came on Thursday as the findings of the inquest into the death of 36-year-old Anaiwan-Dunghutti man Nathan Reynolds were released in Sydney. Reynolds, who died on the floor of prison having an asthma attack in 2018, was deprived of “at least some chance” of surviving by the “confused, uncoordinated and unreasonably delayed” response to his emergency by prison guards and health staff, the NSW coroner said. “These failures were due both to numerous system deficiencies and to individual errors of judgement,” Elizabeth Ryan said. She said it took more than 11 minutes for correctional officers to reach his side, 13 minutes for a nurse to be summoned, 22 minutes before a nurse arrived at his side and 47 minutes before ambulance paramedics attended him. Outside the court, Reynolds’ family expressed their solidarity with the families of the three people who had died in custody in the past week. “People should not die in prisons away from their loved ones,” Makayla Reynolds said. “Last week another two people died in NSW prisons. This morning we were advised of another death in Victoria. Our thoughts and support go to their families. No family should ever have to go through this.” The two prison deaths in NSW only came to light when a bureaucrat was questioned in a parliamentary hearing by Greens MP David Shoebridge.   Related: Aboriginal man died from asthma attack after 'unreasonably delayed' response from prison staff   It was “not appropriate” to advise the public of deaths without any detail and “cause a lot of anger, a lot of angst and a lot of grief”, the Corrective Services NSW commissioner, Peter Severin, said Tuesday. But the NSW Aboriginal Legal Service disagreed. “The NSW government has an obligation to let people know things that are in the public interest, and this includes when there has been a death in their care,” its chief executive, Karly Warner, said. The hearing on Tuesday was also told hanging points were still present in Tamworth correctional centre despite a coronial recommendation to remove them after the 2017 death in custody of Tane Chatfield. “It is well past time for real accountability,” Warner said. “The NSW government, including Corrective Services and police, must operate with transparency and be answerable to families and the public.”  In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14.

       "  'title': 'Covid vaccine row: EU has exported 34m doses – including 9m to UK',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'A total of 34m doses of coronavirus vaccine have been exported from the EU despite shortages for people living in the bloc, including 9m sent to the UK and 1m to the US, which has a ban on sales abroad. The internal figures were leaked as the EU was embroiled in a tit-for-tat with Boris Johnson over claims that the UK had an export ban in place. A European commission spokesperson conceded on Wednesday that the UK had not imposed a ban, following the allegation made by the European council president, Charles Michel, on Tuesday. But officials said Michel wanted to know how many exports had been made from the UK as they highlighted the role of EU-based production sites in the global effort. “We know that different countries have got different measures in place – that doesn’t concern vaccines, as far as we understand, coming from the UK,” a commission spokesperson said. “But we know as well that we, the EU, are a very, very active exporter of vaccines and that this is not necessarily the case of all our partners.” According to the latest figures seen by the Guardian and accurate as of 9 March, of the 34,090,287 doses exported from the EU to 31 countries, 9,106,162 went to the UK, 3,917,640 to Canada, 3,134,204 to Mexico, 2,720,210 to Japan and 1,368,900 to Saudi Arabia. Other beneficiaries of EU exports included Hong Kong (1.3m), Singapore (967,030), the US (953,723), Chile (942,825) and Malaysia (751,140). The majority of vaccines exported from the EU to the UK were made by Pfizer, which distributes globally from its European production sites, it is understood. The EU has blocked only one export request under its controversial authorisation mechanism for vaccines, a shipment of 250,000 Oxford/AstraZeneca doses from Italy to Australia. On Tuesday Michel, who chairs the summits of EU leaders and helps direct policy, provoked an angry reaction in London after stating in a newsletter that the UK had “imposed an outright ban on the export of vaccines or vaccine components produced on their territory”. In a sign of the testy state of relations, Michel’s claim about a British export ban was swiftly denounced as “completely false” by the UK foreign secretary, Dominic Raab. The EU’s ambassador João Vale de Almeida was summoned to the Foreign Office but he was in Brussels. Instead, the EU’s charge d’affaires in London, Nicole Mannion, the Irish deputy head of the Brussels delegation to the UK, was received on Wednesday morning by Sir Philip Barton, the permanent undersecretary of the Foreign Office. Barton is understood to have conveyed the government’s irritation about the claims. A UK government spokesperson said the meeting had been necessary “to discuss the issue of incorrect assertions in recent EU communications”. Speaking to MPs on Wednesday, Boris Johnson waded into the row to emphasise that Michel, a former prime minister of Belgium, had been wrong to allege the UK had imposed a prohibition on vaccine exports. Johnson said: “We can also be proud of the support the UK has given to the international Covid response, including the £548m we’ve donated to Covax. I therefore wish to correct the suggestion from the European council president that the UK has blocked vaccine exports. Let me be clear, we have not blocked the export of a single Covid-19 vaccine or vaccine components. “This pandemic has put us all on the same side in the battle for global health. We oppose vaccine nationalism in all its forms. I trust all sides of the house will join me in rejecting this suggestion and call on our partners to work together to tackle this pandemic.” In his contentious newsletter, Michel sought to compare the EU’s exporting record to that of the UK and other countries including the US, in response to suggestions that the bloc was verging on protectionism in barring a recent export of vaccines from Italy to Australia. Two weeks ago Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European commission, suggested that Britain and the US had blocked the export of Covid-19 vaccines. Von der Leyen has asked Joe Biden to lift the US ban on exports. The UK has regulations to stop profiteering on medicines and medical items such as masks but the government does not impose a ban on vaccine components or completed doses. The UK did ensure that vaccine doses produced by Oxford/AstraZeneca at the sites in Staffordshire and Oxford were directed in the first instance to residents in Britain. The EU has since been angered by the refusal of the Anglo-Swedish firm to redirect doses in light of production shortfalls from European facilities. The company has in response pointed to its policy of having dedicated and largely separate supply chains for the UK and the EU. An UK official said the high number of EU exports was a reflection of the business model of Pfizer and other major pharmaceutical suppliers who produce largely from European sites to distribute globally. Michel tweeted on Tuesday night: “Glad if the UK reaction leads to more transparency and increased exports to EU and [other] countries. Different ways of imposing bans or restrictions on vaccines/medicines.”\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'Come True review – blow-out imagery in visionary sleep disorder thriller  ',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'There is something visionary about this near-nonsensical, kitsch but atmospheric techno-thriller from Canadian director Anthony Scott Burns. Drawn along on dark somnambulic rhythms, it incorporates elements of fantasy, horror and 80s synthwave aesthetics without giving itself over completely to any of them. A wordless first 10 minutes introduces us to Sarah (Julia Sarah Stone), a runaway student apparently unwelcome or unwilling to return home, waking in spectrally lit parks and falling asleep in coffee shops. Dropping suddenly into surrealistic CGI dreams that track inexorably towards a demonic figure who, if approached too closely, wakes her with a start. Sarah decides to try to climb out of this insomniac bath by enrolling in a university sleep study. It is overseen by Dr Meyer, a Cronenbergian academic in big glasses, but run by a trio of researchers who, like the memory technicians in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, have a loose relationship with scientific protocol. Becoming close to Jeremy (Landon Liboiron), she learns that they are using pioneering technology to observe the subjects’ dreams – and that the same shadowy presence manifests in all of them.    But Burns doesn’t pursue this supernatural lead where you would expect, committing instead to a dream-logic that mostly abrogates him of plot duties. Acting as his own cinematographer and editor, he puts together a blow-out of imagery with great technical skill that fleshes out this waking dream of a film. Sarah watches her dream self in Jeremy’s mind’s eye on the monochrome monitors, which later melds into a stylised aquamarine-flooded sex scene that is like a Michael Mann wet dream (a debt acknowledged by the use of Shriekback’s Coelacanth, the spine-chilling tune from Manhunter). Talking is beside the point – and, with Stone adept at mute trepidation, it often feels that way even when there is some dialogue. As for interpreting what it all means, leave that to Burns’s therapist. The flamboyance on display here, though, promises great things. • Come True is released on 15 March on digital platforms.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'What is journalism for? The short answer: truth | Clive Myrie',\n",
       "  'full_article': \"Who, what, where, when and why? Five questions that are at the heart of our trade. Answer those questions in relation to any news story, and we’re doing our jobs as journalists. They underpin everything we do, what we write in a newspaper or online, what we say on TV or on the radio. It feels to me, however, that we sometimes need to ask one of those questions of ourselves: why? It doesn’t have to be every day or all the time, but given the power we have, it’s important. What is the point of the media in a democracy? What are we here for? We can influence massive societal changes. Indirectly we even wield political power, able to influence policy, perhaps even able to help change governments. And with power as we’re all well aware, comes great responsibility. Former Sunday Times editor Harold Evans understood this down to the marrow in his bones, and he chose throughout his storied career to leverage that power for the greater good of society. But who should police this? Is it enough to let the industry itself be the gatekeeper of how far a broadcaster or newspaper should go in trying to make a profit or build an audience? Or are independent regulators the only way to ensure media companies use the power they have wisely? Contrast the situation here in the UK, where there is a robust and for some choking regulatory framework with the US, where oversight in one crucial respect is nonexistent: the requirement to fairly represent the views of opposing sides in news and current affairs broadcasts. Could that lack of a check on how America does news actually imperil democracy itself? In 2009, James Murdoch, son of Fox News’s founder, Rupert, gave a speech at the Edinburgh International Television Festival. His MacTaggart lecture made it clear what he believed the role of the media was in a democracy. Making money was the starting point from which everything else flowed: all the good, benign stuff – creativity, public trust and news coverage that was truly independent and challenged the consensus. His exact words were: “The only reliable, durable, and perpetual guarantor of independence is profit.” It follows, then, and James Murdoch agreed that the only regulator should be the market. If the public doesn’t like your product, it will go someplace else. It’s the public that will keep you on the straight and narrow. There is no need for a regulator invested with powers by statute. Harry Evans didn’t agree with statutory regulation, in his case for newspapers. As he told a BBC interview: “When you start writing the law … between the sentences, between the commas, a whole scandal may escape because of a well-meaning intent to protect somebody, or someone’s interest.” But Evans did firmly believe in powerful independent regulation with teeth, even though it wasn’t backed by statute, because maintaining public trust in the press was vital. He called for press regulation that was tough and that went beyond what many in Fleet Street wanted. After the Leveson inquiry into press standards, he supported proposals for a regulator which would be wholly independent of commercial interests and the publishers of newspapers. “It must be committed only to enhancing the standards of the British press,” he said, “and restoring public confidence. It is a necessary condition of the freedom of the press to act in the public interest.”   Related: The British press isn't racist, say the editors. That just shows how long the problem will endure | Joseph Harker   Broadcasters in the UK are forced to be fair and impartial in their news coverage, in order to hold a licence. The rules come under section 5 of the regulator Ofcom’s codes covering due impartiality, accuracy and opinions. Similar rules did exist in America, but they were thrown out more than 30 years ago, when Ronald Reagan was president, and attempts since to revive the legislation have always stalled on the altar of the first amendment, the right to free speech. So in the US you can say what you like within the law – your opinion is protected and you can use all your power and might to beam that opinion right across the land, without giving any counter-arguments, without reporting the opposing point of view. Opinion can be dressed up as news. The storming of the US Capitol on 6 January this year shamed America, but was partly the logical conclusion of a toxic media environment with no rules, promoting public distrust. It was one consequence of a media free-for-all and was years in the making. And where there is a void of fact and truth and public trust, conspiracy theories can live and breed. I travelled round this country during the 2019 election campaign – from County Durham to Southampton, Enniskillen to Pembrokeshire, and I came across people on the right who’d be very happy to get their news from a UK equivalent of Fox News, and some on the left who’d be very happy to watch a British equivalent of MSNBC. It’s in this atmosphere that two new TV channels are coming onstream. GB News, under the leadership of the brilliant Andrew Neil, and a new venture backed by Rupert Murdoch. The New York Times quotes Neil as saying British news broadcasting is pretty much a one-party state. “They all come at stories from various shades of left,” he says. “GB News would come from the centre, perhaps the centre right, not the hard-right approach of Fox. GB News will offer diverse voices and stick to the facts,” he says. He is too good a journalist, with a reputation to protect, to want to be associated with a news channel that peddles conspiracy theories and propaganda. And in any case, Ofcom, the regulator, is watching. Impartiality rules and strong regulation are the bulwark against the disaster of the American media jungle being replicated here, with its attendant detrimental effects on democracy. But with the perception of impartiality often being in the eyes and ears of the beholder, one Conservative MP, Steve Baker, influential in the Brexit vote and frequently interviewed about his views on the subject, believes Ofcom itself needs reform. When James Murdoch posed the “why” question in 2009, as chairman of BSkyB, he stressed the importance of a media company making money, untrammelled by regulation – that a better-informed society would flow from the market. But more than a decade later, when asked the same question, he’s come to a very different conclusion. He’s now attacking the US media for the current “toxic politics” threatening American democracy, and said in an interview with the Financial Times that proprietors are as culpable as politicians, who “know the truth but choose instead to propagate lies”. Harold Evans would probably never have thought there would be a day when a senior member of the Murdoch family would sound as if he agreed with him, not just about the purpose of the media but how it should be achieved. That there might actually be a point to independent regulators, because a clear and transparent set of rules and guidelines that everyone can follow and everyone can see increases public trust. I’ll leave you with the words contained within the fairness doctrine, now consigned to history in America, but alive and well for many years to come, we all hope, in the regulations of Ofcom. Evans would no doubt agree.Licensees must not use their stations “for the private interest, whims or caprices of licensees, but in a manner which will serve the community generally as a whole. Broadcasters must provide adequate coverage of public issues, and ensure that coverage fairly represents opposing views.”The maintenance of democracy and a just and fair society. That is why we do what we do.

       "  'title': \"Civil liberties groups call police plans for demos an 'assault' on right to protest \",\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Civil liberties campaigners have warned of a “staggering assault” on the right to protest, as police detailed how they would enforce controversial government proposals to restrict demonstrations. On Thursday, Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services (HMICFRS) published its plans for the future of policing protests, two days after the government announced proposed new laws granting more powers to officers and the home secretary. Among other things, the police, crime, sentencing and courts bill will give Priti Patel powers to create laws to define “serious disruption” to communities and organisations, which police can then rely on to impose conditions on protests. The HMICFRS report, ordered by Patel following Extinction Rebellion (XR) and Black Lives Matter (BLM) protests, outlines a “need to develop” covert intelligence gathering methods and an expectation of increased use of facial recognition technology, despite a court of appeal ruling last year that its use in south Wales breached privacy rights and broke equalities law. The report also supports expanding stop and search “to prevent serious disruption caused by protests”, amid concerns over discriminatory use of the power. Emmanuelle Andrews, policy and campaigns officer at Liberty, said: “These plans are a staggering assault on our right to protest as well as an attack on other fundamental rights. “Police already have extensive powers to restrict protests, and frequently go beyond them even though it is their duty to facilitate the exercise of this right. “We are still in the grip of a pandemic that has changed all our lives, handed enormous powers to the government and dramatically restricted our protest rights. The proposals in the policing bill are an opportunistic bid from the government to permanently erode our rights. “We must reject the politics of division that the government is exploiting through this bill, and protect each other and our ability to stand up to power.” The bill also allows for police to impose conditions such as start and finish times and maximum noise levels on static protests – powers officers already have in relation to marches. But the HMICFRS wants the rules to be even more closely aligned with those for marches, by forcing organisers of static protests to provide advance notice of their plans and enabling police to ban assemblies, with the consent of the home secretary, if the imposition of conditions would not be sufficient to prevent serious public disorder. Kevin Blowe, campaigns coordinator of the police monitoring group Netpol, criticised the report as “alarming and illiberal” and “essentially a series of recommendations on how you can massively expand surveillance on protest movements at a time when the government has decided that it’s going to crack down on those protests”. The report is the first to feature the term “aggravated activists” instead of “domestic extremists”, the use of which Netpol campaigned against for almost a decade. It defines aggravated activists as “those who commit protest-related crime or unlawful behaviour. The most frequent level of aggravated activism associated with protests is low.” Alanna Byrne, of XR, said similar labels were applied in the past to other groups “on the right side of history”, adding: “Priti Patel can try and make the UK a protest-free zone but it’s clear that the government is not going to do the right thing without protesters holding them to account so we don’t plan on stopping anytime soon.” Announcing the bill, the Home Office said the new laws would “enable police to better tackle unauthorised encampments, and safely manage protests where they threaten public order or stop people from getting on with their daily lives”. Matt Parr, from HMICFRS, said: “The right to gather and express our views is fundamental to our democracy. But this is not an absolute right. The police need to strike the correct balance between the rights of protesters and the rights of others, such as local residents and businesses. “We found that the police too often do not find the balance between protecting the rights of the protesters and preventing excessive disruption to daily life, which even peaceful protest can sometimes cause.”\\n',\n",

       "  'title': \"A Nobel winner turns to picture books: 'It is a powerful way of telling a story'\",\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Ever since Olga Tokarczuk won the 2018 Nobel prize, her growing legions of English language fans have been eagerly awaiting the translation of her 1,100 page historical epic The Books of Jacob. So it’s both surprising and amusing to find it gazumped by a slender picture book, meditating on the value of patience. The Lost Soul is the Polish author’s first venture into picture books, and it pours a childlike sense of wonder into a once-upon-a-time tale that is already resonating with adults around the world. “I adore the picture book,” she says. “It’s a unique form of communication that sets off a sort of proto-cinema in our minds. The language has to be limited to what’s absolutely essential. It’s the picture that carries the story. For me it’s a powerful, primeval way of telling a story that’s able to get through to anyone, regardless of age, cultural differences or level of education.”    ‘Proto-cinema in our minds’ … Olga Tokarczuk. Photograph: Roberto Ricciuti/Getty Images   Aptly, for a book published in a time of unprecedented stress, it’s a fable of a man’s decision to chill out and reconnect with himself, alone in a country cottage – though at first, he doesn’t even realise that he needs to do so. “His life was all right without his soul – he slept, ate , worked, drove a car and even played tennis,” it opens. “But sometimes he felt as if the world around him were flat, as if he were moving across a smooth page in a math exercise book, entirely covered in evenly spaced squares.” After suffering a panic attack in a hotel bedroom, he takes off to see a wise doctor who advises him to take some time out, because only by sitting still and patiently waiting will he be able to reconnect with his soul. The story, which unfolds on pages latticed like a maths exercise book, is a collaboration with illustrator Joanna Concejo, who has fed and watered the short text so that it blossoms across 48 pages.    Illustrations from The Lost Soul, by Joanna Concejo. Photograph: Seven Stories Press   The pair, who are already working on a second book, first met while sneaking out for a cigarette at the Paris book fair. “I said I loved her books, and it turned out she knew who I was, and was familiar with my illustrations,” says Concejo, who has lived in France since graduating from art school in Poland. “I was fascinated by Joanna’s work,” says Tokarczuk. “Somehow, to me her pictures were soothing and calming. I found them irresistible.” Their collaboration began when Tokarczuk was approached to write a picture book by one of Poland’s leading children’s publishers. She dug out the story, which had been languishing unfinished and untitled in her computer, and immediately suggested Concejo to illustrate it. “I can’t actually remember how I came to write it,” she says. “It started life as a sort of tribute to someone who’s always in a hurry and never has any time, because he’s a man of action, working hard non-stop. Then I developed it, and this little story emerged. The theme of a soul in search of its owner appears in various cultures; it’s one of those basic narratives that turns up now and then, in any place and at any time.” She is clear that the finished work is as much Concejo’s as her own: it was the illustrator’s idea to personify the soul as a young girl, and to represent the growth of the man’s soul in pots full of plants, notably tumbling geraniums. “Yes, there are lots of geraniums,” says the illustrator. “I love houseplants and I also have them on my balcony. I used not to like them – I thought they were rather dull and uninteresting. But in time I’ve learned to appreciate them. Maybe because they’re very hardy, and if you take care of them, they show their gratitude with lots of blossoms.”    ‘I never try to adapt my style to fit a particular audience’ … an illustration from The Lost Soul by Joanna Concejo. Photograph: Seven Stories Press   Since being published in Poland in 2017, The Lost Soul has sold more than 100,000 copies in 21 languages, and is finally coming out in English in a translation by her longtime collaborator Antonia Lloyd-Jones. “I wasn’t expecting the book to be such a huge success, but it soon became clear that many people were buying it as a gift for a close friend to show that they care, to express their best wishes. The book was like a message. And there were others who just wanted to put it on the coffee table, as something to look at while relaxing. I like both these reasons for buying it,” says Tokarczuk. Does the restrained palette and retro-imagery of people playing in a wintry Polish landscape make it a picture book for adults rather than children? “I think picture books are increasingly important, and a lot of adults are interested in this sort of book, where a large part of the message is conveyed by the images. But I never try to adapt my style to fit a particular audience. I’m not sure I know what that means, or how to do it,” says Concejo. “The world in Joanna’s drawings looks as it was a few decades ago, which is clearly a reference to the childhood of people who are now adults,” adds Tokarczuk. “It’s amazing how calming and cathartic it can be to immerse yourself in the world of your childhood.”  The Lost Soul by Olga Tokarczuk, translated by Antonia Lloyd-Jones and illustrated by Joanna Concejo, is published by Seven Stories Press on 18 March.

       "  'title': \"Budget cuts and collapse in tourism revenue pose 'severe' threat to nature\",\n",
       "  'full_article': \"Job cuts in nature reserves and environmental rollbacks by governments during the Covid-19 pandemic could undermine global efforts to conserve biodiversity and tackle the climate crisis, according to new research. Budget cuts and a collapse in ecotourism revenue have forced national parks and conservation organisations to make staff cuts and reduce activities such as anti-poaching patrols, with Asia and Africa severely affected. Brazil, India and the US have also emerged as “hotspots” for cuts to environmental protections during the pandemic, with all three among several countries considering proposals to allow mining and fossil fuel extraction in protected areas. Examples included in the report are proposals by the Brazilian government to allow mining and fossil fuel extraction in indigenous reserves, new permits in Russia that allow deforestation in natural areas for transport and infrastructure, and progress on plans to explore and drill for oil and gas in the US Arctic. The findings come in a collection of research papers published in a special issue of the journal Parks by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), which seek to understand the consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic on the environment. Brent Mitchell, co-editor of the journal, said: “What we learnt from our 150 contributors is this: if the shock of Covid-19 is not enough to make humanity wake up to the suicidal consequences of the destructive course of much misguided development, with its onslaught on nature, then it is hard to see how further calamities – far worse than the current pandemic – can be avoided.” His comments echo those of the UN secretary general, António Guterres, who has warned: “Humanity is waging war on nature. This is suicidal.”    The Arctic national wildlife refuge, Alaska. The report cited the US as a “hotspot” for cuts to environmental protections during the pandemic. Photograph: AP   A survey of park rangers in more than 60 countries found that about one in five had lost their jobs because of pandemic-related budget cuts, with those in Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa and Asia worst affected. More than half of protected areas in Africa reported that they had had to stop or reduce field patrols and anti-poaching operations. While many protected areas have maintained core operations, communities living near nature reserves and national parks have been particularly hard hit by the economic consequences of the pandemic and drops in visitors.   Related: 'Ecological island': as Maasai herding lands shrink, so does space for Kenya's elephants   “While the global health crisis remains the priority, this new research reveals just how severe a toll the Covid-19 pandemic has taken on conservation efforts and on communities dedicated to protecting nature,” said Dr Bruno Oberle, director general of the IUCN. A review of Covid-19 economic recovery plans implemented or advanced between January and October 2020 found that while some governments included conservation areas and extra funding for nature, many have diminished environmental protections. Rachel Golden Kroner of Conservation International, the lead author of the study on impacts of government stimulus packages, warned that the current crisis could not be allowed to further damage natural environments. “If we are to build a sustainable future, rollbacks of environmental protections must be avoided, and recovery measures need to be planned in a way that not only avoids negative impacts on biodiversity, but charts a more sustainable and equitable way forward,” she said. Reacting to the research, Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, head of the Global Environment Facility, an independent financial organisation that helps fund countries to meet environmental targets, said: “Investing in nature conservation and restoration to prevent the future emergence of zoonotic pathogens such as coronaviruses costs a small fraction of the trillions of dollars governments have been forced to spend to combat Covid-19 and stimulate an economic recovery.”\\n\",\n",

       "  'title': 'From Ghana to London: James Barnor given major retrospective',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'A Ghanaian-British photographer who captured the African diaspora in 60s London and created black fashion images that inspired a new generation of artists is to have his work displayed on Piccadilly Circus’s big screens as part of a major retrospective. In 1967, James Barnor took an iconic image of the BBC Africa Service reporter Mike Eghan on the steps of the Eros fountain in Piccadilly, and now more than 50 years later his own work will be beamed out overlooking the same spot during April. The retrospective at the Serpentine, originally supposed to open in June 2020, marks a spectacular rise for Barnor, 91, who until an expansive show at Autograph in 2010 was largely unknown in the British photography world. Barnor, who lives in London, started his career in his home town of Accra, Ghana, as a photojournalist before setting up his Ever Young studio, where he took portraits and staged images. “I always treated my sitters and my customers with the utmost respect,” he said. “I was conscious of what people were wearing and tried to bring the best out of them.”    James Barnor in Accra, circa 1952. Photograph: Autograph   When he moved to the UK he trained in photography and began shooting images for South Africa’s Drum magazine, which included cover shots of black fashion models. The artist Liz Johnson Artur says Barnor’s work presented a different take on the black communities that had settled in London in the 50s and 60s, which previously had had been mostly represented in images taken by white, European photographers. “His pictures were clearly taken by someone who was from the community but also there was a style that I really liked that wasn’t about exposing but rather showing,” she said. The Serpentine curators Lizzie Carey-Thomas and Awa Konaté say Barnor’s archive – which includes 40,000 images – amounts to a substantial survey of not just the diaspora in London, but also pre-independence Ghana, as Accra bubbled with Pan-Africanism and hopes for a new future.

Photograph: James Barnor/Galerie Clémentine de la Féronnière   “There are so many different avenues you can take with James’s work – it’s such an enormously interesting slice of history, both from the perspective of Barnor and the UK,” Carey-Thomas said. “You never see a James Barnor photograph and think that there’s some kind of impassive documentation. It’s always like there’s a connection there.” Part of the programme around Barnor’s retrospective includes a virtual launch with participants including Artur, Naomi Campbell, Edward Enninful and Tyler Mitchell, the photographer who shot the recent Kamala Harris Vogue cover and has been influenced by Barnor. “We are archiving my pictures for future use – I’m leaving my pictures so that they can be used to gain something when I’m gone,” said Barnor. “Every walk of life needs photography. You need to use it to teach and in order to record an instance. People and portraiture are the most important thing: when you go to a place it’s the people you meet that will be the thing you remember.” The James Barnor retrospective will open on 19 May at the Serpentine, subject to government guidelines. • This article was amended on 12 March 2021 to correct the year in which James Barnor took the picture of Mike Eghan on the Eros steps.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'UK risks echoing ‘toxic’ US media without strong regulator, says BBC anchor',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'The UK must retain a strong independent broadcasting regulator or risk echoing America’s “ultra toxic media environment”, the BBC journalist Clive Myrie has warned.   Related: What is journalism for? The short answer: truth | Clive Myrie   With Ofcom’s role under new scrutiny and suggestions that former Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre, previously sceptical of the value of media regulation, could be appointed as its chair, the news anchor will use a pre-recorded speech, to be streamed on Thursday evening, to make the case for “a clear and transparent set of rules and guidelines that everyone can follow and everyone can see”. While some observers warn that the regulator is no longer fit for purpose and must adapt to better deal with new digital media, Myrie used the Sir Harold Evans Memorial lecture to defend the fundamental purpose of the model. Arguing that as a regulated public broadcaster, the BBC “helps bind the country together” he said that in the US “it’s the opinion hosts who can mould and shape minds”, leading to a “trust deficit” that “has serious consequences for the fabric of US society, and the future of American democracy”. Myrie’s intervention comes at a time of flux in UK media, with two new players – Andrew Neil’s GB News and Rupert Murdoch’s News UK TV – set to enter the broadcast news market later this year. While some have expressed fears that the newcomers intend a Fox News-style approach, a claim they deny, Myrie said Neil was “too good a journalist with a reputation to protect to want to be associated with a news channel that peddles conspiracy theories and propaganda.”   Related: Rupert Murdoch at 90: what now for the media mogul?   In the lecture and accompanying Guardian piece, he went on: “In any case Ofcom, the regulator is watching. Impartiality rules and strong regulation are the bulwark against the disaster of the American media jungle being replicated here.” In a Q&A after the speech, Myrie said the case of Piers Morgan, the subject of 41,000 Ofcom complaints over his questioning of the Duchess of Sussex’s claims about the handling of her mental health concerns, was evidence of the value of the regulator. “He has been flexing the guardrails when it comes to fairness and impartiality, but the guardrails ultimately are there,” he said. Evidence of a different view in the US came earlier this week when CNN host Jake Tapper tweeted of the Ofcom investigation triggered by the complaints: “This is what happens when you live in a country where there is no first amendment. Insanity.” That stance was disputed by many UK broadcasters, with Channel 4 News host Krishnan Guru-Murthy arguing: “Not insanity. A democratic choice to have broadcast media regulated with a duty to be fair and duly impartial. It stops TV from taking sides to support or oppose things the way you do in America and upholds a code of standards.” Myrie also referred to James Murdoch’s assertion in 2009 as BSkyB chair that “the only reliable, durable, and perpetual guarantor of independence is profit” and noted: “now, more than a decade later … he’s come to a very different conclusion.” He said that Murdoch, who resigned from the board of News Corp last year, was “now attacking the US media for the current ‘toxic politics’ threatening American democracy”. In his speech, which will be available to view from 6pm, Myrie concluded: “The facts are plain. Public confidence in an unregulated media, falls well below the level of confidence … for a media that’s regulated.”\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'Tour of tangopolis: a dance through the rhythms of Buenos Aires',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Listen to Chris Moss’s Piazzolla 100 selection on Spotify On a central reservation in Puerto Madero, Buenos Aires’ youngest and least atmospheric neighbourhood, stands a strange-looking monument. It’s a twisted, abstract sculpture, in steel, that looks at first glance like the cooling fins from a motorbike engine. It is, in fact, an unfurled bandoneón (button accordion), the fiendishly difficult instrument of German origin that produces the unmistakeable sound of tango: a pained and plangent breath from a broken heart.    A sculpture of the bandoneón (an accordion), used by Astor Piazzolla to produce the sound of tango , in Puerto Madero. Photograph: Cavan Images/Alamy   The composer, bandleader and musician who made the bandoneón globally famous was Astor Piazzolla, whose centennial in 2021 will be celebrated – or, at least, remembered – by players, dancers, singers and songwriters the world over. “His fingers move about that instrument as though they were snakes,” said jazz legend Gerry Mulligan. For his part, Piazzolla said the button accordion had “a velvet sound, a religious sound”. He was the high priest of that religion.  On 5 March, Buenos Aires’ venerable Colón opera house reopened after a year-long closure with a two-week Piazzolla programme. Here in the UK, scheduled tributes, such as a “¡Viva Piazzolla!” night at the Liverpool Philharmonic, have been either deferred or cancelled. There are, though, virtual events honouring the centennial, including monthly gigs beamed from Boedo in Buenos Aires, lectures and dance classes in Philadelphia and a free Piazzolla “cyber jazz” show from Nottingham . I’ll be toasting Piazzolla’s memory with a glass of Argentine vino and spinning a few scratchy shellacs on my ancient gramophone. All right, I exaggerate: tango brings out my inner melancholic. But I will take out some vinyls and CDs, not just Piazzolla but his precursors and heirs, and play the songs that changed my perception of Buenos Aires. Unable to be in the city right now – I lived there from 1991 to 2001 and visited at least once a year until 2019 – I rely on tango to transport me there. Piazzolla’s one-time collaborator, the poet Horacio Ferrer, called Buenos Aires a “tangopolis”. He meant that, from the radio soundtrack during a taxi ride to the psychodramas of everyday life to the way people walk and talk, tango left an indelible mark on the city and its people. Does this mean that the tango city can be seen by the virtual visitor? Well, yes, but you have to squint somewhat to penetrate beyond the facades of the modern metropolis and – I’d suggest – plug in a song or two on your earbuds to help you visualise the ghosts of the tango era.    Cafe Tortoni, a live tango venue in Buenos Aires, founded in 1858. Photograph: Emiliano Rodriguez/Alamy   It’s often remarked, somewhat sensationally, that tango was born in the bordello. Certainly there are songs – such as Celedonio Flores’s Margot – that namecheck this milieu, and orchestras were used in brothel waiting rooms to keep clients entertained. But tango experts agree that the primal origins were in the arrabales – the run-down outskirts along the river and the working-class districts of the fast-growing city of the 1890s. The place to get a sense of this is La Boca, which, away from the pastel-hued tourist honeypot of Caminito (named after a 1926 tango by Juan de Diós Filiberto), has retained a shabby, edgy quality. Many tangos are set in the district, which as a port was a melting pot for immigrants from Europe as well as black Argentinians. Ángel Villoldo, an Argentinian of African heritage who has been dubbed the “father of tango”, performed bright, sometimes bawdy songs in La Boca bar rooms in the first decade of the 20th century. Tango skipped across the ocean around this time, enjoyed a boom in Paris, and then arrived back in BA. The Argentinian middle classes promptly fell in love with it. Venues such as Cafe Hansen and the Armenonville cabaret sprang up around Buenos Aires’ well-to-do barrios and, in 1912, wealthy bon vivant Baron Antonio de Marchi organised a showcase for a patrician audience at the Palais de Glace. This ushered in an era of great orchestras led by the likes of Osvaldo Fresedo, Juan Carlos Cobián and Julio de Caro. It’s also the era of grand cafes: surviving landmarks like the Cafe Tortoni have kept up their links with tango through intimate concerts and milongas (dance nights); and many of the so-called cafés notables (listed establishments) have photographs of tango greats on their walls; others are named after songs or artists.    The late Astor Piazzolla, with his bandoneón. Photograph: Eugene Maynard/Redferns   Tango canción (tango songs with words) dates from this period. Its foremost practitioner, Carlos Gardel, wrote music to words by poet-lyricists such as Alfredo Le Pera and Pascual Contursi. Hit songs – Volver, Mi Buenos Aires Querido, Por Una Cabeza – are alternative national anthems for many porteños. There’s a statue and street art celebrating Gardel in Abasto, where he spent most of his days when not on tour. The best monument to him is above his tomb at the Chacarita cemetery, while Recoleta’s necropolis has the posh marble mausoleums, Chacarita’s houses tango legends. Gardel fans sometimes drop by to leave flowers and to slot a lit cigarette between his statue’s stone fingers. Gardel’s songs about local bars, friendship, barrio life, betting and drinking played a major role in tango-ifying the city, showing any theme could be set to music – sad, sprightly or otherwise. A little later, tango went through an evolutionary period. Charismatic frontmen like Aníbal Troilo – another bandoneón superstar – and pianist Osvaldo Pugliese added layers of musical complexity, while women singers such as cross-dressing Azucena Maizani, glamorous Ada Falcón, dirt-poor Rosita Quiroga and outspoken Peronist Nelly Omar – later blacklisted by the military government – challenged male hegemonies. In Buenos Aires, even the street names are sexist – but in the 1990s when Puerto Madero was made the city’s 47th barrio, it was decided to honour women in street names; Maizani and Quiroga have their own calles now. By the second world war, the golden age of tango was pretty much over. In 1944, Enrique Cadícamo penned a song about the Palais de Glace that ripples with nostalgic longing. But Piazzolla, who had played in Troilo’s band, had other ideas. He set out creating a “nuevo tango” that enlivened the rhythms of tango with jazz and neo-classical touches. He was not short on sentiment – his Adiós Nonino (Goodbye Grandaddy) – is unashamedly slushy. But he introduced experimentation, chromatic harmonies, atonality, dissonance and a contemporary pace and punch. Inspired by Vivaldi he wrote a four-seasons cycle for Buenos Aires. He composed a “little opera” called María de Buenos Aires. He wrote symphonic works, used electric guitar and collaborated with vibraphone players and famous authors like Borges. Initially, the squares who preferred their tango in stockings and dandruffed suits rejected his ideas as pretentious and even traitorous; but in the end they were won over and, in June 1983, he had his own gala night at the Colón – described by local daily La Nación as “Piazzolla’s apotheosis.”    The tomb of the French-Argentine singer Carlos Gardel, at Chacarita cemetery. Photograph: Mariana Eliano/Cover/Getty Images   If Gardel’s songs evoke Buenos Aires in a literal manner, Piazzolla’s compositions conjure a more fantasy-laden city. Sublime works like Milonga del Angel, Escualo and Vuelvo al Sur contain hints of ideas about the city – the angel statues in the cemeteries, the dancers in the plazas, the cobbled streets of the southside – but never crudely or clumsily. Once, in San Telmo, I saw a young trio hammering out Libertango – the most famous of all Piazzolla’s songs, thanks to Grace Jones’s 1981 cover version – and the music made for an absolutely perfect soundtrack of the barrio as we see it today – past and present colliding, tangueros mixing with rock kids and metal fans, and tango a cultural artefact rather than a real, lived experience for most people.When I get over to Buenos Aires, I’ll see a tango band at Centro Cultural Torquato Tasso, do some tango-themed walks and go shopping for records in the markets and disquerías. I’ll pay my belated respects to Piazzolla. There’s a bust of him in Recoleta and a statue in the Atlantic seaside resort of Mar del Plata, his birthplace; but the steel bandoneón remains the most fitting homage. He was a passionate and argumentative artist who enjoyed upsetting the establishment and took tango kicking and screaming out of the ballroom and in to the concert hall. He was a sublime writer and arranger of songs, suites, concerti and film music. But he was most fully himself when he was live on stage, at the front of a quintet or octet, pulling out the ends of his bandoneón as his brow unwrinkled and he let the angels, and devils, sing. He demonstrated, through his virtuosity, that the humble accordion possesses the emotional expressiveness of a violin or piano. He also proved you don’t need to be a good dancer – or a dancer at all – to love, and live, tango. As someone who prefers his Latin rhythms sitting down, I’m eternally indebted to Astor Piazzolla.

       "  'title': 'Thursday briefing: Sarah Everard – man arrested on suspicion of murder as human remains found',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Top story: ‘Utterly appalled at this dreadful news’ Hello, Warren Murray helping you get up to speed quickly. Investigators have found human remains in Ashford, Kent, during the search for missing woman Sarah Everard. A policeman in custody on suspicion of her murder has been named as PC Wayne Couzens, 48. Couzens is in the elite parliamentary and diplomatic protection command. He was arrested on Tuesday at his home in Deal, Kent. The Metropolitan police commissioner, Dame Cressida Dick, said: “The news today that it was a Metropolitan police officer who was arrested on suspicion of Sarah’s murder has sent shockwaves and anger through the public and through the Met. I speak on behalf of all my colleagues when I say that we are utterly appalled at this dreadful, dreadful news. Our job is to patrol the streets and to protect people.”     On Wednesday officers searched locations in London where Everard, 33, disappeared on the night of 3 March, as well as Deal, and woodland near Ashford including an abandoned paintball centre. Couzens had been arrested on Tuesday night on suspicion of kidnapping, alongside a woman in her 30s suspected of aiding an offender. Both remain in custody. In a statement, the Met said: “Today, Wednesday 10 March, [Couzens] has been further arrested on suspicion of murder and a separate allegation of indecent exposure. The man is a serving Metropolitan police officer in the Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Command.” London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, said: “I know how shocked and worried Londoners are by Sarah’s disappearance and the developments in the case. Londoners will continue to see more police officers on our streets continuing their investigation and carrying out reassurance patrols in the area where Sarah went missing a week ago.” The Women’s Equality party said an outside police force should be brought in, given the case involves a Met officer. The force has referred the case to the Independent Office for Police Conduct, which said: “Following assessment we determined that both conduct referrals relating to the kidnap/murder and indecent exposure should remain under local investigation by the force. We have also received a mandatory referral in relation to the actions of police after Sarah was reported missing. This is still being assessed to determine what further action may be required from us.” * * * ‘Barely scraping by’ after Brexit – The manufacturing trade group Make UK has found in a survey of more than 200 leading industrial companies that 74% are facing delays with EU imports and exports amid continuing disruption caused by Brexit and the pandemic. More than half of companies said they were suffering from increased costs, while more than a third had lost out on sales, and fear of continued disruption was costing them future business. Catherine Bedford, founder of Dashel, which makes carbon fibre and recycled cycle helmets, said the disruption was killing her business. “Thanks to Brexit, we’ve gone from profitable to barely scraping by,” she said. Make UK says ministers urgently needed to “get back around the table” with EU leaders to solve problems. * * * GMB staff complained over Morgan – Multiple staff on Good Morning Britain made complaints to senior managers about Piers Morgan’s comments on the Duchess of Sussex before he quit, the Guardian understands. There were 41,000 complaints to the regulator Ofcom over remarks on Monday that cast doubt on Meghan’s statement she had been denied help with mental health issues. Her representatives also complained on her behalf to Ofcom. The former BBC presenter Andrew Neil has said he wants to talk to Morgan about a role on the soon-to-launch right-leaning channel GB News, but he would not want “any shouting or ranting or raving” on there. The Society of Editors’ chief has resigned after a letter in its name, denying there was racism in UK press coverage of Meghan, led to boycotts of the National Press Awards, which the society organises. * * * LGBT advisers quit – Two of the government’s LGBT advisers have resigned. Jayne Ozanne, a member of the LGBT+ advisory panel, accused ministers of creating a “hostile environment” for LGBT people and claimed the equalities ministers Liz Truss and Kemi Badenoch were “ignorant” on key issues. James Morton, who has been a manager at the Scottish Trans Alliance, handed in his resignation from the same panel. There is frustration at the government’s delay in outlawing conversion practices. Badenoch has told MPs “we are committed to ending conversion therapy in the UK”, but speaking to ITV News, Ozanne said: “I do not believe this Tory government, sadly, have the best wishes of the LGBT community at heart … Instead we seem to have a Trump-esque mode of operation where they’re listening to the rightwing evangelicals and those frankly who want to take us back.” Labour accuses the government of having “prevaricated” on banning conversion practices “for far too long”, claiming it reveals “a pattern of behaviour which seeks to dismiss the real impact of the discrimination experienced by so many”. * * * Snapshot in passing – People in England will be able to check at home if they have bowel cancer by swallowing a tiny capsule containing miniature cameras, avoiding the need for a hospital procedure that will not be described here. Pictures transmitted from inside the body to a belt recorder are checked by doctors for signs of disease.     The capsule is about the size of a cod liver oil tablet – after the job is done it leaves the body in a predictable manner. It is part of an NHS effort to have more diagnosis and treatment of illness done at home. * * * Change of underpants – Marks & Spencer is to sell rival lingerie brands for the first time, but only on its website, as part of an initiative to boost sales. The retailer, which already accounts for just under a third of UK underwear sales, is to introduce selected items from Sloggi and Triumph alongside eight other new clothing labels online. “About time, too,” writes Nils Pratley. “M&S has tortured itself and its customers over the years with its attempts to develop in-house brands. Only three can be said to have worked: Autograph, Per Una and Goodmove. It would have been better to import partnership-style thinking 20 years ago.” Today in Focus podcast: Can Johnson lead climate fight? Later this year, Boris Johnson’s government will host COP26 in Glasgow – possibly one of the last opportunities for the world to avert global climate catastrophe. Guardian environment journalist Fiona Harvey examines whether the UK government is equipped to lead the world in the crisis.     Lunchtime read: Take bad sex seriously “Women know that their sexual desire can remove protection from them and can be invoked as proof that violence wasn’t, in fact, violence (she wanted it).” Consent has been portrayed as the cure for all the ills of our sexual culture. But what if the injunction to “know what you want” is another form of coercion?    Sport Mohamed Salah insisted Liverpool’s players must “leave the pressure off the field” after helping ease their Premier League woes by reaching the quarter-finals of the Champions League. At the Parc Des Princes, Lionel Messi scored a brilliant goal and missed a penalty as Barcelona failed to overturn a first-leg deficit against Paris Saint-Germain to exit the competition. England’s icy stance on Alex Hales may have started to thaw but the message from Eoin Morgan is that breaking into his World Cup squad this year will be difficult given the abundance of top-order options. Saracens could face a battle to hang on to their England stars if they fail to secure an immediate return to the Premiership, with several senior players believed to have release clauses in their contracts. Pep Guardiola was scathing about VAR’s decision not to award a penalty after Southampton’s Alex McCarthy clearly brought down Phil Foden during Manchester City’s 5-2 victory. Thomas Bach has been re-elected as president of the International Olympic Committee by 93 votes to one after a series of lavish tributes from IOC members. Thirteen months since last winning a professional tennis match, Roger Federer has defeated Britain’s Dan Evans 7-6 (8), 3-6, 7-5 at the Qatar Open. The Equality and Human Rights Commission will be asked to investigate racism in English cricket following disturbing revelations from black and Asian players and umpires. Rugby league’s Women’s Super League will return next month after an absence of more than 18 months in a major boost to England’s home World Cup chances. And Olympic swimming champion Klete Keller has pleaded not guilty to seven charges over the invasion of the US Capitol by a pro-Donald Trump mob in January. Business Stocks have climbed in Asia after a key measure of inflation in the US came in lower than expected, easing worries that price pressures could push interest rates higher. Shares rose in Tokyo, Shanghai and Hong Kong but edged lower in Sydney. The Labor Department reported US consumer prices rose 0.4% in February led by a jump in gasoline prices. But core inflation, excluding food and energy, posted a much smaller 0.1% gain, easing fears inflation might surge. The pound is worth $1.393 and €1.168 at time of writing while the FTSE should open about 0.3% higher on current trends.

The Express says “VIP protection cop held in murder probe” while the Mail says “Armed cop held on Sarah murder”.    Guardian front page, Thursday 11 March 2021. Photograph: Guardian   “Sarah: grim find as cop is arrested” – that’s the Metro, while the Times seeks to offer reassurance: “Police insist women safe as remains discovered”. “Yard officer arrested on suspicion of murder” says the Telegraph while the Sun on this occasion adopts a distinctly muted tone: “PC held for murder as body found”. The Mirror says “Your priorities are all wrong Boris” as it lists test and trace, an Irish Sea tunnel or bridge – and Dominic Cummings – as things the PM has wasted money on, while nurses only get a 1% pay rise. The i hails “10 million vaccine jabs boost for UK”. Both those front pages point to Sarah Everard coverage inside. The FT says “Biden’s historic $1.9tn stimulus package crosses the finishing line”, which you can read about here. • The headline of this article was amended on 11 March 2021.

       "  'full_article': 'Like many comedians, Josh Widdicombe and Rob Beckett found themselves without an outlet when the pandemic struck. And so, like many comedians, they decided to make a podcast. Theirs – Lockdown Parenting Hell – has become one of the most popular in the country, mining the stresses of everything from twins, tantrums and building a trampoline to the tune of more than 15m downloads. Beckett has two young children with his wife, Louise Watts, while Widdicome and his wife, Rose Hanson, have one, with another on the way. Each week, the pair interview a celebrity (past guests have included Michael Sheen, Philippa Perry and Paddy McGuinness) while sharing stories about their upended domestic lives. It is fast, fun and, at times, genuinely touching. Here, they share their thoughts on their pandemic pastime. Stuart Heritage: Shouldn’t you be looking after your kids instead of doing a podcast?Rob Beckett: I think the podcast gives us a good excuse to not look after them. That was the main reason we did it, really, wasn’t it? So that we can have a justifiable break from parenting. Josh Widdicombe: It’s a way for us to go upstairs without feeling guilty about it. That was the whole elevator pitch for the podcast. RB: The podcast started because we’d been texting each other, moaning about how hard lockdown was. It’s a WhatsApp group that’s got out of hand, essentially. It’s also self-therapy for us. I was having a wobble and I think Josh quite enjoyed the fact that I had it worse, with one more kid than him. JW: Totally. It was the main thing getting me through. And I thought that other people would get some joy out of his pain. RB: But now Josh is expecting a second child, so the tables will turn.     Previous guests have included (from left) Philippa Perry, Jamelia and Michael Sheen. Composite: Pål Hansen/The Observer; Darren Staples/Getty Images   SH: Has Rob prepared you for the arrival of your second, Josh?JW: I’m genuinely excited about it. Particularly because I think I’ll be a lot more confident with the child. All that stuff about: ‘How do you hold them?’ ‘How do you swaddle?’ I’m all right with that now, so I can actually enjoy having the child. But, conversely, I’m heartbroken about how it’ll coincide with the pubs reopening and the European championship [Euro 2020]. It’s brutal. RB: I’ll be constantly in the pub. The grandparents are desperate to see the kids and they’re so easy to look after now, so I can just leave them with them. It’s a completely guilt-free opportunity. SH: What have you learned about parenting in the past year?JW: I think I’ve learned to chill out about it; that’s the main thing. Learning that the “big moments” – Christmas morning, the building of the snowman – are almost always not the big moment. But that’s OK. Sometimes, it’s enough to have a terrible time building a snowman. RB: You think: “Oh, when we go on this holiday, that will be the magical family moment,” but instead you’re blindsided by something that happens at one o’clock on a Tuesday afternoon. I was away so much more before lockdown. I was working day and night. Classic poverty mindset: get all the money in before it goes away, work work work. My family life was dominated by grand gestures and big things. I’d be like: “I’ve got three days off, so let’s book somewhere.” But I think I’ve realised that the kids enjoy it just as much if you’re hanging around with them and placing more emphasis on being there, rather than working hard to save money for a big Disney thing. They don’t care, and just being with them is way more enjoyable for everyone. I’m going to try to work less and have fewer things. JW: That’s good, because it means there’ll be more corporate gigs for other comics.    ‘I’m bored of Netflix, I want to do a gig, I don’t want my kids in my house’ ... Rob Beckett. Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The Guardian   SH: Has lockdown changed your relationships with your partners?JW: I think it’s made it much better, in that there’s less pressure on our time together. I used to be working five nights a week, so it felt like a waste if, on that sixth night, we just watched The Repair Shop and looked at our phones. But you need that time together, that total write-off time. It’s much more difficult to continue a relationship positively if, whenever you see each other, it’s like: “This is date night.” Maybe I didn’t realise that until lockdown. RB: I didn’t realise, and I don’t think Lou [Beckett’s wife since 2015] even realised, how much she was doing on her own. Before lockdown, I was working all day on TV shows and doing tour shows in the evening and I’d been to LA, South Africa and Paris before January. I was never home and Lou had to do everything, which wasn’t good for her or me. In my head, I’m providing for my kids, but I’m not providing as a husband or a dad. It can’t just be a monetary support thing. SH: You’ve said that the podcast has a predominantly female listenership – why do you think that is?RB: I feel like a lot of the female audience enjoy listening to men chat about parenting, because not a lot of men do. It’s that whole thing of getting men to speak more, about mental health and stuff like that. Sometimes, the female audience quite likes trying to know what a bloke’s thinking about. It’s like spying behind enemy lines. JW: In terms of mental health and speaking about stuff, this has unknowingly really helped me deal with the last year. It is so useful to talk about these things. It’s provided an outlet and, I think, for listeners it’s the same. RB: And the listeners aren’t even all mums. We’ve got so many people that don’t have kids, but everyone is either a parent or had parents. I do think people listen to try to piece together how their parents parented them, or how they would parent. A lot of grandparents listen, too, to remind them of what it was like when they had younger kids. It shocked us that the audience wasn’t just parents of young kids. SH: Have you struggled with any aspects of lockdown?JW: I think I initially struggled with the idea that it was an opportunity. On the podcast, [the comedian] Ellie Taylor told us that her friend said “lockdown isn’t a writer’s retreat”. I spent 10 years going: “I would do that, but I’ve got a gig,” and then thought lockdown could have been my chance to write the great American novel. There was all that early pressure for lockdown to be a moment for everyone to find themselves, but actually it’s just about getting through it. RB: I’ve found lockdown three tough. We’ve been locked down since November, then Lou had to shield for two or three months and that was really hard. It was cold and miserable and the kids got mad. I’m bored of Netflix, I want to do a gig, I don’t want my kids in my house. I want to get out and live my life.    ‘My dad was basically an old hippy’ ... Josh Widdicombe. Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The Guardian   SH: Do you think dads have more trouble making new friends than mums?JW: I have struggled. We didn’t make friends through NCT [a charity that provides support for expectant parents], because we did an extreme two-day course. The friends I’ve got at the nursery gates are all mums, actually. I haven’t made any new dad friends, beyond acquaintances. RB: It’s a lucky dip. I think women are nicer and more empathic, so they will suffer a dickhead for longer, whereas I’d just sack him off and do something on my own. I don’t know if that’s me, or all men. What I’ve learned is to just let Lou make friends and I’ll pick the one with the bloke I get on best with, and that’s our new double date. JW: So she does a shortlist and then you pick a winner? SH: Do you listen to other parenting podcasts?JW: I’ve listened to Chris and Rosie Ramsey’s podcast [Sh**ged Married Annoye\\u202ad] occasionally. RB: I mainly listen to boxing and football ones. JW: I listen to podcasts about unsolved murders and paranormal activity. I’ve just listened to two documentary series about Robert Maxwell. In many ways, they act as interesting parenting podcasts. SH: Does your approach to parenting differ from how your dads parented you?JW: My dad was basically an old hippy. He grew up in the 60s, so I had a very laid-back childhood. There was no pressure to do well at school or do a certain job – I’d hope that would be the thing I take from that. But then I’m a more uptight person than my dad, so that probably comes through. RB: I’m more hands-on than my dad was. He was a long-distance lorry driver and a cab driver, so he worked mad hours and we wouldn’t see him much. I don’t remember him picking me up from school that much, because that’s when he worked. But that was more due to money than, you know, him just really loving driving. He loves us to pieces, but he had to earn the money, so he wasn’t there. I have that same mentality, which nearly led me to burnout before Covid. But now I’ve realised that it’s more productive to work less and be there more. It’s a learning curve. You only act in the way you’ve seen, so it’s hard. SH: How were your homes growing up?JW: I didn’t really get told off when I was a kid, but that’s a combination of my dad being laid-back and me being a dweeb. It was kind of a perfect storm, in that sense. There was also a lot of taking the piss; that was a big deal in our house. I would want my children to grow up in a house that was a laugh; I would hate for it to be a sterile atmosphere. RB: Our house was brutal, to the point where it was too much. My brother had acne on his back, so his nickname was Dartboard Back. My brother Joe had smelly breath for about half an hour and got called Dogshit Breath for ever. I was called Jaffa Cake Nips because I had fat nipples through puberty. My mum used to call it The House of No Compassion. It shocked me when I went on Mock the Week and everyone said: “They’re all really intimidating.” What? My house is much worse than this. SH: Where does Lockdown Parenting Hell go when lockdown ends?RB: I’ll shake off Josh and take all the earnings. JW: But he says I can come on as an interview guest. RB: We genuinely started it because we thought it would be fun to do, but last week it was the top podcast in the country. I feel like now we’ve built a little community, so I would love to carry it on. It’s a journey that we need to carry on as our kids grow up. JW: I remember at one point panicking, wondering if my daughter would hate me for it, but then I realised that the whole thing is really positive. I love the idea of a document that she can go back and discover when she’s older, combined with interviews with people that she won’t have heard of. RB: I feel like it’s made me a better parent, because we’re talking to Philippa Perry and all these people who have older children. JW: I think it’s made me a way better comedian, too, because I’ve never given much of myself to comedy in terms of revealing my personal life. But the success of this has taught me that the more honest you are, the funnier you are. On Sunday, I was in my car, stuck at this red light for five minutes, and people were honking at me to jump the light. And, yeah, I was stressed, but I was also thinking: “This is going to be great for the podcast.” Josh Widdicombe hosts Hypothetical at 10pm on Wednesdays on Dave\\n',\n",

       "  'title': \"'I can't help but cry!' – how The Great Pottery Throw Down became a tear-jerking hit\",\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Keith Brymer Jones is talking about pots and crying. “I get emotional,” says the master potter, “because it’s a craft I love. It is my life. When I see a potter communicating their creativity via something they’ve made, I can’t help but cry. You’re watching imagination come to life. It’s so special.” Crying over pots has become something of a USP for Jones, ever since he took to our screens in 2015 as one of the two judges of The Great Pottery Throw Down, a craft-based competition in the vein of Bake Off and Sewing Bee, placing hopefuls behind the rotating wheel for their chance at artistic success. Jones has cried at everything from delicate arrangements of bowls, to vases, sculptural forms and a dainty tea set. Where Paul Hollywood has his handshake of yeast-based approval, so Jones has his tears of kiln-fired delight. Yet this is no gimmick. Speaking to an overall-clad Jones by video link from his art studio in Whitstable, Kent, it is clear that pottery is his lifeblood and translating that passion to screen is what has made the show such a gently endearing success over its four series. Jones had an “epiphany” when he first discovered clay in art class as an 11-year-old. “The moment I touched the clay,” he says, “I realised this material was absolutely for me. It’s this living, moving thing you’re creating from and I couldn’t get enough of it. When I reached the sixth form, I used to bunk off school and go to the V&A museum, where I’d spend all day looking at pots and reading up on them. Almost 40 years later, I’m still learning.”    Kiln-fired delight … Siobhán McSweeney, Keith Brymer Jones and Rich Miller. Photograph: Mark Bourdillon/Love Productions   It wasn’t his pottery prowess that initially earned Jones a spot on TV but a video he made parodying Adele and her hit Rolling in the Deep. Stuffed into a dress and heels, he sings: “There’s a fire / Starting in my kiln / Hotter than that pottery scene / In that Patrick Swayze film.” The YouTube clip, titled Rolling Clay with Keith, found its way to Bake Off producer Richard McKerrow. “I was in a punk band as a teenager,” says Jones. “That punk ethos has stayed with me. I don’t take myself too seriously. Anyone can laugh at me or with me. It’s absolutely fine. But the one thing I do with a passion is take my craft very seriously.” Jones was sceptical about the appeal of a pottery show when he was first approached, though. “I said pottery on telly would be like watching paint dry. I also didn’t want to make a programme that sets people up to fail. I didn’t want to do an X Factor. I have too much respect for the craft. And, to the show’s credit, it turned out nothing like that at all. It has always extolled the virtues of the potters. It has revealed a wonderful process.” Indeed, the format of the Channel 4 show is designed to highlight each competing potter’s artistic development. We start with 12 keen home practitioners and one is eliminated each week, having been set a major making task and another speed-throwing against-the-clock challenge. This year, they have graduated from humble chamber pots to art deco punch bowls with matching decanters, which is the challenge in the final this Sunday. In the American-themed quarter final, they had to make pottery fired in cow dung and throw an Alabama ring bottle, which looked impossible. Then there was the hilarious second season episode where they were asked to make entire toilets, which kept collapsing. Meanwhile, the handle-pulling challenge was one of the most phallic episodes ever seen on TV.    Who wants a shot? … Ryan Barrett and his turtle toilet. Photograph: BBC/Love Productions   Siobhán McSweeney, the Derry Girls actor who presents this latest season, thinks dedication has been key to the programme’s appeal. “There’s a lack of agenda. It’s not about sob stories or manipulation – it’s a load of people genuinely trying to do their best and showing authentic creativity. You can’t diminish the fact that these contestants are real nerds about pottery. Of course they want to win, but they would also usually not be able to afford all this clay or get feedback on these new techniques. It adds an extra dimension of genuine curiosity, which mirrors the audience’s.” It is a curiosity that McSweeney was allowed to explore herself during filming. “It turns out using the wheel is really hard,” she laughs. “It’s really physically demanding and, like everything in my life, if at first I don’t succeed, I tend to drop it. So now I’m on to embroidery.” Still, it heightened her appreciation of the potters, all of whom isolated with the crew in a bubble at Gladstone Pottery Museum in Stoke-on-Trent for 11 weeks of filming in 2020. “Getting the call to present the show was a godsend,” she says. “I had a very tough first lockdown because I was shielding and I was coming off the back of a rough couple of years having experienced a number of bereavements. Being able to do something so wholesome like this show in the countryside, and to be assured of my safety, was incredible. It meant that for the first time in a long time, I wasn’t worried about my life. I didn’t need to get up at 4am and dress in a giant condom to walk around the block. I could be in the fields instead. I came back rejuvenated.”    ‘Genuine curiosity’ … Jodie Neale. Photograph: Love Productions   Rich Miller, who is the other judge in the show, echoes these sentiments. “The show has been a massive highlight in such a tough year,” says Miller, over the sound of clay being slapped down on a nearby workbench in his studio. “You can’t help but be inspired by people really pushing themselves. And the clay responds to the minds of the makers, so the creativity is infectious. I felt a real responsibility to encourage people to keep improving.” As the show’s former studio assistant, Miller used to have the nerve-shredding job of carrying the contestants’ completed works to the drying racks and then into the kilns, hoping not to smash them on the way. Does Miller, like Jones, ever feel teary when the creations are placed before him? “You’re observing the whole process they go through and you just want them to succeed. That’s why Keith gets so emotional – you get invested. I was close to crying a few times but I thought I’d better not tread on Keith’s toes. Maybe it’ll happen next time.” Crying or not, Miller has a similarly personal connection to clay as Jones. “I struggled through school,” he says, “being the only black kid out of around 1,500 other students. But ceramics was a real salvation because it’s all about the material. It doesn’t matter who you are, where you are, or what you’re making, since we’re all just trying to do the same thing: turn this material into something permanent. Even today, when I’m making something, I lose myself in it. I love the possibilities with clay. It feels like there are no boundaries.”   Related: Love and obsession: how leading UK ceramics collection ended up in London council flat   Jones thinks that, as well as the unashamed self-expression the show unlocks, there is a lesson to be learned: “We need to get back to an honest relationship with the natural materials we use in the world, an understanding of the craft that goes into making something, rather than expecting everything to be mass produced and cheap.” He holds up a delicately glazed espresso mug and saucer. “This piece was given to me by one of the potters on the first series, a guy called Nigel. He was a builder and he had a real issue with his other builder mates giving him jibes about being on the show. But he produced this incredibly delicate piece. It was such a surprise to have this work from him. I love that, in life, you don’t know when someone is going to surprise you like that, to totally defy your expectations. Isn’t that beautiful? I have to stop now otherwise I’ll start crying again.”  The series finale of The Great Pottery Throw Down is on Channel 4 on 14 March at 8pm. \\n',\n",

       "  'full_article': 'The Victorians did not have much idea what caused weather patterns but they knew what effect they had on their welfare. Enquire Within Upon Everything, “the indispensable guide to living”, published in 1856, poses many important questions and provides answers. Among the topics is spring weather and the effect it will have on future harvests. For example: what is the use of March winds? “They dry the soil, (which is saturated by the floods of February) break up the heavy clods, and fit the land for the seeds which are committed to it.” This theme is repeated in seven other questions about this month’s weather, such as why “a dry cold March never begs bread” and “a wet March makes a sad autumn”. The answers are that a dry month allows the seed to germinate in the soil and produce fruit in the autumn and in a wet one “much of the seed rots in the ground, and the autumn crops are spoiled”. The helpful and pretty accurate explanation of the meaning of common sayings continues: “Why is it said that March flowers make no summer bowers?’’ Because, “if the spring be very mild vegetation gets too forward, and is pinched by the nightly frosts, so as to produce neither fruits nor flowers”.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'California attorney general cuts off researchers’ access to gun violence data',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'For decades, America’s gun violence researchers fought an uphill battle against the National Rifle Association to obtain the data and funding they need to study the effects of US gun laws. But researchers in California say they are now facing a different, unexpected hurdle: the state’s outgoing Democratic attorney general. Under Xavier Becerra, who has been nominated to serve as Joe Biden’s health secretary, California’s department of justice started to deny researchers access to firearms data used to evaluate a wide range of gun laws and policies. The new data restrictions have put key projects at California’s state-funded gun violence research center in limbo, and locked Becerra into a bitter, bizarre public standoff with one of America’s most respected gun violence researchers.  series linker  California, which has much stricter gun laws than most American states, also has more detailed government data available, including records of individual handgun purchasers going back decades and statewide records about the restraining orders filed to temporarily bar at-risk people from owning or buying guns. This more detailed personal information has allowed California researchers to conduct rigorous analyses of the state’s gun laws and policies, looking at early evidence of whether the state’s new gun violence restraining orders have helped to prevent mass shootings, studying whether buying a handgun puts a person at higher risk of dying from gun suicide, and examining whether expanding the category of people with violent records who are barred from buying guns might reduce gun violence. But it’s precisely this more detailed personal information, including about gun purchasers, and subjects of gun violence restraining orders, that Becerra’s justice department is telling some researchers that it will not provide. The department is also attempting to formalize some of these policies, including in a proposed rulemaking under discussion this week that would limit researcher’s access to personal information about the subjects of gun violence restraining orders across the state. The justice department has cited privacy concerns as a justification for the data restrictions, and has said it believes current California law does not permit the agency to release certain kinds of data to researchers. “The California department of justice values data-driven research and its role in pushing forward informed public policy to help combat problems like gun violence,” it said in a statement. “We also take seriously our duty to protect Californians’ sensitive personally identifying information, and must follow the letter of the law regarding disclosures of the personal information in the data we collect and maintain.” But Garen Wintemute, a professor at the University of California, Davis, and the director of California’s firearms violence research center, said some of the data the justice department is now denying researchers had been previously shared with them for decades, and other data is specifically mandated to be shared with the gun violence research center under California law.  “People have started to wonder what other reasons there might be for which privacy is a fig leaf,” Wintemute said.    Xavier Becerra became California’s attorney general in 2017, the same year, Garen Wintemute said, that problems began with firearms data access. Photograph: Rich Pedroncelli/AP   When California in 2016 created the firearms violence research center, America’s first state-funded institution researching the topic, Wintemute was named its director, and the California legislature specified that the justice department and other state agencies would provide the center with the data it needed to study risk factors for firearms violence and the effectiveness of different prevention strategies. Wintemute said the center’s problems with accessing firearms data access started in 2017, when Becerra became California’s attorney general, and escalated in early 2020. “They’re refusing to provide any detailed explanation. They’re simply saying: you can’t have the data,” Wintemute said of the department’s decisions. “One of the mysteries is why this is happening: the law has not changed.” During a meeting with the justice department’s research head and two staff attorneys last March, Wintemute said, he was told that “these decisions were being made by ‘exec’”, which he interpreted as meaning Becerra and his deputy, Sean McCluskie, who was recently appointed the chief of staff for the federal Department of Health and Human Services. “I think there is real grounds for concern that this sort of unethical approach to science is about to move to the head of health and human services, which is home to the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, some of the leading research institutes in the world,” said Wintemute. In statements justifying the department’s current policy, Becerra’s office repeatedly cited a piece of new legislation drafted by Wintemute himself, which would mandate the Department of Justice provide data to researchers as evidence that the current law was ambiguous and needed to be clarified. Thedepartment of justice also pointed at Becerra’s broader record on gun violence as attorney general, including his legal defense of California’s attempt to ban high-capacity ammunition magazines, which is still being litigated, and his involvement in multiple lawsuits pushing for tougher regulation of “ghost guns”. McCluskie and the health and human services department did not respond to requests for comment. Sarah Lovenheim, a former Becerra adviser, said in an emailed statement that “AG Becerra has a strong track record on gun violence prevention and merely acted in keeping with state law.” The standoff in California is worrying for public health experts nationwide, since previous data access in California has made kinds of studies possible that have not been conducted in other states. “I consider it a pretty serious challenge to gun violence research,” Daniel Webster, the director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, said. While some Republicans and gun rights activists have pushed back against public health research on guns for decades, “I can’t think of an example” of another Democratic politician serving as a barrier to this kind of work, Webster said. In an editorial Tuesday, the Sacramento Bee, which first reported the news of the data dispute, blasted Becerra for “hiding gun violence data” and accused him of “obstructing”, rather than upholding, state law. And three national organizations – Brady United Against Gun ViolenceGiffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, and the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence – have prepared comment opposing the new rules, with two of the groups arguing that they would “obstruct the mission of policymakers in both California and other states hoping to save lives by passing the most effective laws.” Some California pro-gun activists, on the other hand, have wondered whether Becerra’s policy was motivated by a desire to “hide data” that might show the policies he supported were ineffective.  “Becerra’s repeated unwillingness to share various types of information suggests he’s more concerned about politics than truth. Is this latest cover-up an effort to hide data that reflects poorly on the effectiveness of his policies?” Chuck Michel, the president of the California Rifle and Pistol Association, said in a statement. Even California lawyers are confused. John Hemmerling, an assistant city attorney in San Diego, said that the state department of justice’s claims that the existing laws for dating sharing needed to be clarified did not make sense to him. “I just can’t figure out why they want to limit some of the data that’s being released to a researcher like the University of California,” he said. Wintemute, who was one of the public health experts whose federal research funding to study firearms issues was cut off after pressure from the National Rifle Association in the early 1990s, said the standoff felt strangely familiar. The behavior of California’s justice department is “similar to what happened in the 1990s”, Wintemute said, when Republicans responded to a taxpayer-funded study finding that gun ownership was linked to an increased risk of homicide in the home by making symbolic cuts to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention budget and warning that federal public health funding could not be used to “advocate or promote gun control”. “Whatever the intent might be,” he said, “the effect is to choke off research on an important problem.”\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'Andrea Jenkins: the first Black openly transgender woman to hold US public office',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Andrea Jenkins lives just a few blocks away from 38th and Chicago, the crossroads in Minneapolis where George Floyd was killed on 25 May last year. She spent two decades of her life working to revitalise the community there, and kicked off her 2017 campaign for the city council’s Eighth ward in an arts centre a few yards away. After Floyd’s death, when the crossroads became a space for collective mourning, Jenkins visited every day. But in the midst of a bitter Minneapolis winter and with the neighbourhood reeling from the long-term effects of Floyd’s death, Jenkins hasn’t been in months. “It breaks my heart,” she says. “I knew every single business owner up there by name. Many of them are struggling – the few who are still there.” After years of economic upswing and community growth, Floyd’s death changed everything. “ When I walk through there, especially in winter time, it’s cold, people are shivering, there’s fire burning out of garbage cans. It looks like a scene out of Mad Max.” These are the consequences of fatal police violence in countless societies around the US, where the ramifications can extend beyond personal grief and trauma, and deep into the fabric of local community relations. But in the case of George Floyd, the repercussions spread so much wider – throughout the world – igniting a global discussion on race and racism. Jenkins, the first Black, openly transgender woman elected to public office in the US, became one of the most forceful voices to emanate from Minneapolis. She is not only a politician but also a poet, oral historian and an activist. She sang gospel in front of the nation’s media at a press conference in the days after Floyd’s death and played a central role in re-examining how the city’s long-criticised police force was funded. She insisted that racism be treated as a national public health emergency. And this month, with the murder trial of former officer Derek Chauvin, she is trying to prepare the city for the potential fallout. “It’s going to be traumatic,” she says of the trial, as we talk over Zoom. “We want to have as peaceful a situation as we can, and really have resources there for people to turn to if there are challenges.” She is in regular contact with members of Floyd’s family, who are equally worried. “But they’re really more concerned about justice,” she says. “They want to see justice and they want to make sure that George Floyd’s name is honoured for the role that his legacy plays in social justice.”    Andrea Jenkins at a vigil for George Floyd with Rev Al Sharpton, centre, and activist Gwen Carr, right, whose son, Eric Garner, who was killed by New York police in 2014. Photograph: Stephen Maturen/Getty Images   Jenkins first saw the eyewitness video of Floyd’s death a few hours after the incident, at around 1am the following morning. She recalls it with vivid indignation. “The first thing was the callousness. The sort of relaxed cockiness. The sunglasses on the top of his [Chauvin’s] head. Hands in his pockets. You know, it just reeked of racism,” she says. “Literally he knew he was being filmed … and he just didn’t stop. To me that goes beyond police brutality. It enters into the realm of just pure, unadulterated racism. And that, unfortunately, is at the core of our society. “We can’t fight what we don’t name. We can’t cure what we don’t name. And so my whole point in declaring racism as a public health crisis is because racism is killing Black people.” Jenkins grew up on the West Side of Chicago, in neighbourhoods she describes as “hard-working and low-income”. Her father battled heroin addiction and spent much of her childhood incarcerated. She was raised mostly by her mother, who worked as an office administrator and brought up her two children, as well as two of Jenkins’s cousins, in a “pretty authoritarian” but “very loving” manner, emphasising the need for a good education. She discovered literature and poetry at a young age. In first grade, her class was visited by Gwendolyn Brooks, the Pulitzer prize-winning poet laureate of Illinois. “I just remember her saying ‘everyone can be a poet’,” she recalls. At the age of 14, Jenkins was taught by the poet Haki Madhubuti, one of the founders of Third World Press, now the largest independent Black-owned publisher in the US. “That’s when I really got indoctrinated into Black history, Black culture, the 1960s Black arts movement. Haki was really a believer that you must use poetry for social justice, and all Black artists should be using their art to uplift the race.” She roots around for an old volume of poetry in a large bookcase behind her and sweeps her braided hair to one side. She reads me one of her favourite poems from that time, I Wonta Thank Ya, by the Black poet Tejumola Ologboni. She looks up, occasionally, with piercing eyes.  She began writing in her mid-teens, and has contributed to and authored a number of acclaimed volumes of poetry, often dealing with intersectional issues of race, social justice, gender and sexuality. But at the beginning, her own gender was never a subject. “I was thinking about it,” she says, “but I would never, at that point in life, express my inner gender identity thoughts in a poem.” At 18, Jenkins moved to Minneapolis for university, and lived in male dorms. “In many ways a lot of my life was really trying to hide from what I knew to be true inside myself. I played football in high school. I joined a fraternity. Even younger, I was in the boy scouts. Because, you know, I didn’t want to be a girl. I knew I was a girl, but I didn’t want people to reject me.” In the early 1980s, Prince and other now high-profile musicians, such as Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, were making their names in Minneapolis. But when Jenkins arrived on campus, which was overwhelmingly populated by white students, it was a culture shock, from the racial stereotyping she experienced (false assumptions she had come to university on an athletic scholarship) to the stark differences in resources. But it was the fraternity that left the most traumatic memories. “I was outed by one of my fraternity brothers,” she says, volunteering the story slowly and carefully. “We were roommates, and he came home from work early one day sick, and I was in the apartment having sex with another man.” The roommate told the rest of Jenkins’s fraternity, who expelled her from the house, forcing her to return to Chicago “because I didn’t have a place to stay”.

Photograph: Tribune Content Agency LLC/Alamy   “I had to tell my mom, like: ‘Why am I home?’ So I came out as bi, which was very true.” She still identifies as bisexual. Her mother took her back home, Jenkins says, thinking “maybe this is a phase”. “I knew at that time I was trans, but again I could just not accept it for myself, and so consequently could not tell my parents or anybody about it,” she says. Instead Jenkins married a woman in her mid-20s, and had a daughter who remains “the absolute love of my life”. It was only after she divorced at the age of 30 that she came out as a trans woman. “I just really realised that I can’t go on any more, hiding the truth from myself. Hiding the truth from those who I love. If I am going to thrive in life, I have to come to grips with who I am, and I have to accept it.” She eventually returned to college and finished her bachelor’s degree at 38, and went on to complete two master’s degrees. Her family are now fully supportive. “They still love me. They still support me. And it took some time to get to that with my immediate family in the very beginning. But people were willing to work through it, people stayed engaged. They did not banish me from existence, which is a lot more than what some families give.” Jenkins was elected in 2017 with more than 70% of the vote, and was voted vice-president of the council shortly afterwards. She had spent decades in local government beforehand, working as a policy aide to other council members and building up strong grassroots networks. Did she feel she was overqualified at the point, in her late 50s, when she launched her campaign? “I don’t believe in the word overqualified. You’re either qualified, or you’re not,” she says, laughing knowingly. “I do feel like being a Black, trans woman made it really important for me to be qualified for the role. Some people can be a reality TV star, and fucking become president. But some of us others have to really pay dues.” Transgender women, and particularly trans women of colour, face “an epidemic” of violence in US society, according to the American Medical Association. Last year, at least 44 transgender and gender non-conforming people were murdered in the US, the highest annual death toll recorded according to the Human Rights Campaign. The grim reality only serves to underline the significance of Jenkins’s political career. Although her jurisdiction may be limited, she still hears from transgender people from all over the state and the country seeking guidance and help. “I have not personally experienced violence, thank God,” she says. “But I’ve certainly experienced humiliation and verbal abuse.” There were “traumatic” and “potentially debilitating” slurs that she doesn’t wish to spell out.    Andrea Jenkins in her city council office in Minneapolis. Photograph: Andrea Ellen Reed/The Guardian   Donald Trump’s assault on the rights of the LGBTQ+ community only heightened the climate of persecution. During Trump’s time as president, the administration introduced a raft of anti-trans legislation, from a transgender military ban, to loosening protections in medical care and other public services by narrowing the legal definition of sex discrimination. During his first public appearance out of office, at last month’s Conservative Political Action Conference, Trump used a rambling speech to make a number of transphobic slurs, pushing the issue further into the rightwing culture wars that continue to rage even after his comprehensive defeat in the presidential election. Joe Biden has already repealed some of the executive action Trump took to curtail LGBTQ+ rights. But, says Jenkins, the administration needs to follow through with its pledge to sign the Equality Act, which would ban discrimination against people based on sexual orientation and gender identity. The bill has already passed the House, but, with a razor-thin Democratic majority in the Senate, its overall fate remains unclear. Away from federal legislation, over which she has no political control, Jenkins hopes that, within the next two decades, the global discussion around gender identity will have moved far beyond the stasis of the past few years. “This thing that we call gender, it’s going to be so different 25 years from now,” she says. “The reality that there are more than two binary gender identities will be, I believe, widely accepted and widely realised by people in the world. It’s only a matter of time. This whole conservative movement … is a last gasp to hold on to power and authority.”   Related: George Floyd killing: Minneapolis on edge again as historic trial set to begin   In Minneapolis, where Jenkins holds her formal political power, she has played a pivotal role in the city’s reimagining of its public safety and policing. The city council had initially considered disbanding its entire police department, a drastic move that was eventually reconsidered, leading instead to a swathe of budget transparency measures, oversight and reallocation of resources. The most striking of which was reallocating nearly $8m into launching new mental health teams that will respond to certain 911 calls. Jenkins is positive about the reforms, but honest. “To be quite frank with you, I am not sure if anything has really changed or if anything really will change. Because it’s in people’s hearts,” she says. “When those cops are out there on the streets, it doesn’t matter how many fucking rules I make. When they killed Jamar Clark [an unarmed African American man killed by Minneapolis police in 2015] that took 61 seconds – from the second the police arrived until Jamar Clark had a bullet in his brain. So I can make them have a body camera, I can give them de-escalation training, and all of these things, and he still fucking shoots the kid in 61 seconds.” It sounds almost as though, despite being an elected representative, she still feels a sense of powerlessness. “You know what gives me a sense of powerlessness?” she asks, pointing out that we are talking just days after 43 Republican senators voted to acquit Trump in his second impeachment trial. “The United States Senate said that white supremacy is OK. That breaking the rules for white men is fine. We don’t give a fuck. But if you so much as sneeze in the wrong direction, Black man, we will kill you in the streets.” She checks herself for a second and takes a breath. “Yes, I’m a policymaker, but all of these systems are so ingrained around us,” she says. “I’ve got to be optimistic that things can change, right? I’ve got to maintain hope. That’s the only thing that has really kept Black people in survival in this country; hope.”\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'Unseen Eve Arnold photos of Marilyn Monroe offered as £30 posters',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'In the photograph she is studiously learning her lines, every inch the poised and professional actor. But in reality Marilyn Monroe was in turmoil: a marriage falling apart, chronic insecurity and a debilitating dependency on alcohol and pills. The picture is one of a series of unpublished photographs of Monroe from the set of her final completed film, seen here for the first time. Taken by Eve Arnold, Monroe’s friend and one of the most admired and distinctive photographers of the 20th century, they show someone who is extraordinarily beautiful and instantly recognisable, but also normal and vulnerable. “There is something about the one where she’s in the car,” said Michael Arnold, Eve’s grandson who manages the family archive. “It’s not the typical glamour shot you often see with Monroe, there’s an ordinariness about it … she is going about her craft, she’s learning her lines. There’s something about the composition which makes it special.” The 15 images are being released by the estate to help fulfil the wishes of Arnold for her work to be a kind of affordable, accessible folk art. Buying an Arnold print would normally cost more than £1,000. The new images are being offered for £30 as posters. In another one Monroe is more whimsical, according to Michael Arnold. There is a similar pensiveness but she is aware she’s being photographed and is playing up to it.    Marilyn Monroe learning her lines during the filming of The Misfits, 1960. Photograph: Eve Arnold/Magnum Photos   It is from the set of the 1961 film The Misfits, which was, to say the least, a troubled production. The film was written by Arthur Miller, a titanic playwright but an inexperienced film writer, as a valentine for Monroe, his wife. A dream team was assembled including John Huston as director and the actors Clark Gable and Montgomery Clift. At the time it was the most expensive black and white film ever made. Huston was often drunk, falling asleep on set in the searing heat of the Nevada desert. Monroe, whose marriage to Miller was falling apart, woke up groggy most days and was late all the time. The Misfits was the last completed film for Gable and Monroe, and a commercial failure, probably better regarded today than it was at the time. “[Monroe] confided in Eve that she was struggling, she was finding it difficult to come to terms with the image that everybody had created of her, she was exhausted at having to live up to that,” said Michael Arnold. When Eve Arnold died in London in 2012, aged 99, it was front-page news. Born in Philadelphia, she became a photographer in her 40s and was the first woman to join the Magnum photographic agency. She photographed the rich and famous and the down-at-heel. Robert Capa, a co-founder of Magnum, once described her work as falling “between Marlene Dietrich’s legs and the bitter lives of migratory potato pickers”. Michael Arnold had a touchingly close relationship with Eve. “She wasn’t really a granny type of granny, she was just a really cool woman that was like a friend and mentor to me,” he said. “She always had so many stories to tell and she would very rarely tell the same story twice.” When he took over managing her archive he came across a quote in which his grandmother said: “I would prefer photography to be a folk art – cheap and available to everybody, rather than elevated to mandarin proportions created through an artificial scarcity.” That triggered memories of a story about her first London show when Arnold wanted students to be able to afford her work and so she sold prints at hugely reduced prices. Later on she would discover that art dealers had bought them to sell for a profit.    Fisherman and family, 1954. Photograph: Eve Arnold/Magnum Photos   From there came the poster plan, which he hopes will help preserve her legacy and introduce his grandmother’s work to new generations. “The themes she photographed are ever-present, if not more so – racism, sexism, inequality … not to mention the humanity she brought to her work.” Michael said Eve was groundbreaking. One of the first subjects she chose to cover was black fashion shows in Harlem, a vibrant world almost totally ignored by the media. Her images were picked up by Picture Post and went around the world. Other images being released as posters reflect the diversity of Arnold’s career: a Mongolian girl at one with her horse; a training session for civil rights activists on how not to react to provocation during sit-ins; and a Cuban fisher joyously spending time with his family. Michael Arnold said his grandmother grew up as one of nine children in a poor Russian Jewish immigrant family. “She didn’t talk about this much but it definitely had a bearing on her desire to make photography accessible to all.” Arnold’s output is still largely an untapped mine, given she took around 250,000 photographs in her career. Only around 2,000-3,000 have been digitised. The posters will be available to buy from evearnold.com/posters from Thursday.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': \"GMB staff complained about Piers Morgan's Meghan comments \",\n",
       "  'full_article': ' Multiple staff on Good Morning Britain made complaints to senior managers about Piers Morgan’s comments on the Duchess of Sussex before he quit the show, the Guardian understands. Morgan’s departure from the programme followed the announcement of 41,000 complaints to the regulator Ofcom over remarks on Monday which cast doubt on Meghan’s statement that she had been denied help with mental health issues. Meghan’s representatives also complained on her behalf to ITV, with the substance of the complaint understood to have focused on how Morgan’s comments would affect others dealing with mental health problems. Now, sources within the show’s editorial and production staff have described how dozens of people inside Good Morning Britain were also uncomfortable about his intervention, with some making complaints. “Everyone is used to Piers saying things like this, but Meghan had literally said that the media wasn’t treating her fairly because of who she is, and he was just doing it again,” said one. Another said that management’s attitude changed after Morgan walked off set when he was confronted by weather presenter Alex Beresford on Tuesday morning, and with an Ofcom investigation pending. “They felt that they had to be seen on the ‘morally right side of the argument,’” they said. “Piers wouldn’t back down and had to go.” Others within the programme characterised the opposition to Morgan as “very much generational”. One said: “There has been a bit of a culture clash but it’s about that, not about his treatment of people.” Beresford had not been scheduled to appear on the show on Tuesday but was drafted in from his other role on ITV West Country to add a “balance of views” after he tweeted critically about Morgan’s statements on Monday, it is understood. ITV declined to comment. On Tuesday it said Morgan had “decided now is the time to leave Good Morning Britain” and “ITV has accepted this decision”. Morgan is understood to have quit after a clash with ITV executives because he refused to apologise for casting doubt on Meghan’s interview with Oprah Winfrey. He had reasoned that his clarification on Tuesday that “it’s not for me to question if she felt suicidal, I am not in her mind and that is for her to say” was sufficient to emphasise that he was not referring to the state of her mental health. On Wednesday he told reporters: “I don’t believe almost anything that comes out of her mouth … If I have to fall on my sword for expressing an honestly held opinion about Meghan Markle and that diatribe of bilge that she came out with in that interview, so be it.” Later, former BBC presenter Andrew Neil said he wanted to talk to Morgan about a role on the soon-to-launch right-leaning news channel GB News. “I think Piers Morgan would be a great asset to GB News and we’ll certainly talk to him about it. I think he needs a little period of quiet reflection before anything happens. And I wouldn’t simply transfer what he did at GMB straight to GB News, I think we’d probably want to do something a bit different,” Neil told BBC Radio 4. Neil said he would not want “any shouting, or ranting, or raving” on the new channel but that Morgan’s controversies helped ITV’s ratings challenge those of BBC Breakfast. Morgan’s longtime co-presenter Susanna Reid addressed his absence on Wednesday morning, telling viewers that they “disagreed on many things” including his remarks on Meghan, and describing him as an “outspoken, challenging, opinionated, disruptive broadcaster”. “It is certainly going to be very different but shows go on and so on we go,” she said. If Reid’s remarks were carefully phrased, some behind the scenes took a more negative view of Morgan’s time on the programme, painting a picture of a figure with disproportionate control over the on-air agenda. One said the last six years had been an “exhilarating and exhausting experience”, adding: “Management lost complete control of Piers years ago – once the on-air sign flashed up above the studio door he was making all decisions. Editorial and gallery team had no clue what was coming next, or any real ability to shape the output once the programme had gone live.” They said that when concerns were raised with senior management about that pattern, “you’d be told there was nothing that could be done. Not to worry they would say, he won’t be there forever”. A senior source acknowledged he had “strong opinions” but denied he had editorial control and said: “Many of the team do have a lot of respect for how he helped raise the game of the show with exclusives and leading on big issues like the pandemic, he was a brilliant force.” One staffer said that they complained to a manager over Monday’s broadcast. “I haven’t ever done that before [because] I think a lot of what’s said about him is exaggerated by people who view him as a useful bogeyman,” they said. “Also he’s been a brilliant interviewer on coronavirus. But I had friends asking me what he was thinking and I felt embarrassed to work here for the first time.” Another source close to the show said that they were aware of complaints from “many, many staff” over Morgan’s remarks. There had been “unease” over some of Morgan’s positions for months, the source said. Viewing figures revealed that GMB had beaten its BBC rival for the first time on Morgan’s final day, with 1.29m viewers against 1.25m for BBC Breakfast. Morgan tweeted: “BREAKING NEWS: Good Morning Britain beat BBC Breakfast in the ratings yesterday for the first time. My work is done.” • This article was amended on 11 March 2021 because an earlier version said that “Meghan’s representatives also complained on her behalf to Ofcom” over Morgan’s remarks.

       "  'title': \"NZ politicians attack Australian minister Peter Dutton for comparing deportees to 'trash'\",\n",
       "  'full_article': \"Australia’s home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, has triggered a political backlash in New Zealand by characterising the transfer of deportees across the Tasman as “taking the trash out” to “make Australia a safer place”. The comments from the home affairs minister were broadcast by the Nine Network this week in a news report into what the channel said was the “secret prisoner plane booting foreign criminals out of Australia”.   Related: Ardern blasts Morrison for shirking responsibility for suspected Isis terrorist who grew up in Australia   Dutton appeared in the report which included footage of deportees, who had committed criminal offences in Australia, boarding the plane. The Queensland-based crime reporter for Nine was given access to the handcuffed deportees as they boarded the charter aircraft at Brisbane international airport. He asked questions such as: “How does it feel to be kicked out of Australia?”  EXCLUSIVE: Tonight Crime reporter @JordanFabris9 is taking you on board the secret prisoner plane, booting foreign criminals out of Australia. #9News pic.twitter.com/0UfRRD0tRY— 9News Queensland (@9NewsQueensland) March 8, 2021  The home affairs minister said the returnees were the “most serious offenders” and Australia was “safer for having deported them”. Dutton noted in the report that more than 700 people had been deported over the past 12 months. New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, said she did not intend to “get into a tit-for-tat” over Dutton’s latest remarks. But she reiterated her “strongly held” opposition to Australia’s policy to deport non-citizens who have committed crimes in Australia. “The Australian government is within their rights to do what they’re doing,” Ardern said. “It just so happens that we strongly disagree with it.” Adern has repeatedly expressed concerns to the Australian government that New Zealand citizens who were long-term Australian residents – including those who had never stepped foot in her country – were captured by the Australian policy.   Related: Peter Dutton's push to use 'secret evidence' to revoke citizenship condemned   New Zealand’s foreign affairs minister, Nanaia Mahuta, said Dutton’s remarks “only serve to trash his own reputation” and were a “reflection on his own character”. She said the Australian government should “reflect on how they portray the transfer of people back to New Zealand”. The Māori Party co-leader, Rawiri Waititi, told Newshub that the majority of the deportees were Māori and Dutton’s derogatory language reflected wider societal hostility, including within the prison system. “Here’s the problem: that is indicative of the system that our people are currently working in or living in,” he said. “The prime minister should be calling on him to explain what he means by trash.” In condemning the policy, New Zealand’s Covid-19 response minister, Chris Hipkins, initially told reporters that Australia was “exporting its garbage to New Zealand” – before quickly backtracking to clarify that he did not think of the deportees as “garbage”. “Those are Peter Dutton’s words, not my words.”  The deportation policy, Hipkins said, was a “deplorable move by the Australian government, which we completely disagree with”. “Having said that – they are entitled to do it,” the minister said. National leader Judith Collins has called for New Zealand to retaliate by returning Australian criminals. “We cannot be the dumping ground for everything wrong that’s happened in Australia with people and criminal behaviour,” she told 1News. “We do need to stand up for ourselves and we do need to stand up for Kiwis.”   Related: How Australia stripped alleged Isis fighter of citizenship without evaluating her case | Rayner Thwaites   Ardern said she had raised New Zealand’s profound objections with the Australian government on more than one occasion. But the prime minister rejected Collins’ assessment that the relationship between the two countries was “the worst” it had been in many years.“There is no breakdown in our relationship at all,” Ardern said. “We have an excellent relationship with our counterparts in Australia and indeed myself, with prime minister [Scott] Morrison, we speak frequently and we work together often.” The deportation issue has been a strain on the trans-Tasman relationship for several years. In 2020, Ardern publicly rebuked Morrison over the policy, declaring that New Zealand would “own our people [and] we ask that Australia stops exporting theirs”.Last month, Ardern also criticised Australia for “abdicating its responsibilities” by unilaterally cancelling the citizenship of 26-year-old Suhayra Aden, an alleged terrorist with the Islamic State who was arrested at the Turkish border. “New Zealand, frankly, is tired of having Australia exporting its problems,” Ardern said at the time. “If the shoe were on the other foot, we would take responsibility – that would be the right thing to do and I ask Australia to do the same.”\\n\",\n",

       "  'full_article': 'Two teenagers have been removed from their parents’ care after social services raised concerns about their weight to a family court judge. The judge, Gillian Ellis, ruled that the children from Sussex be taken into long-term foster care. She described the case as “very sad and unusual”. Social services staff at West Sussex county council had told a family court judge about their concerns. The local authority had provided Fitbits (fitness trackers) and paid for gym membership for the family, who had also signed up to Weight Watchers. But Ellis said months after family court proceedings began there had been no reduction in the children’s weight, and they had not provided recordings from their Fitbits or attended the Weight Watchers appointments consistently. The judge said the children’s parents not seemed to understand the seriousness of concerns raised by social services staff and had failed to set boundaries and promote healthy eating and exercise. She said the children needed the chance to “learn ways of living more healthily” and to improve their health by losing weight. The judge said there were also concerns about poor home conditions and a lack of guidance on personal care. “Everyone agrees that this is a very sad and unusual case, of a loving family, where the parents meet many of the basic needs of the children, but the local authority has been concerned that the parents are not meeting the children’s health needs, in that both children are severely overweight, and the parents have shown an inability to help the children manage this condition,” said the judge in her ruling. She added: “The case was such an unusual one because the children had clearly had some very good parenting, as they were polite, bright, and engaging.”  Detail of the case emerged in a ruling by Ellis published online on Wednesday. She had considered evidence at a private family court hearing in Sussex last year. The family could not be identified in media reports of the case. Ellis added: “The children had failed to engage consistently in exercise despite the local authority providing Fitbits and paying for gym membership. The children were supposed to provide recordings from their Fitbits, but this had not been done. The mother blamed lockdown for the inability to exercise, but exercise could still be taken in the home or by walking outside. The attendance of the family at Weight Watchers had been inconsistent.” In 2012, a five-year-old girl was taken into care after her weight reached 66kg (10st 5lbs), more than three times the weight of a healthy child her age. She was placed in foster care by Newport council, Wales. Figures in 2014 disclosed that up to 74 morbidly obese children were estimated to have been taken into care over a five-year period across England, Wales and Scotland. • This article was amended on 11 March 2021 to add a metric weight measurement in accordance with our style guide. \\n',\n",

       "  'title': \"NSW to go it alone on vehicle emissions standards to avoid becoming 'dumping ground'\",\n",
       "  'full_article': \"Plans are in the works for New South Wales to go it alone on vehicle emissions regulations after nearly two decades of inaction by the federal government. The details were revealed after a draft copy of the New South Wales 2020-2030 Clean Air Strategy, outlining proposals for stricter regulations around noxious emissions and CO2 standards for vehicles sold within the state, was leaked to the media. While the document raises concerns about pollution caused by wood-fired heaters in regional areas, its most ambitious proposal is for a plan to “harmonise” the state’s vehicle emissions regulations with European standards and encourage the uptake of electric vehicles. The New South Wales minister for environment, Matt Kean, declined to comment about any specifics as the strategy was still subject to cabinet processes.   Related: 'Do-nothing document': Australian electric vehicle strategy lets emissions keep rising   “Any changes NSW proposes to the national vehicle emission standards would only apply to new cars that are already available overseas. More importantly, cleaner vehicles are more fuel efficient, saving motorists money at the bowser,” Kean said. “I will always advocate for policies to stop NSW being used as a dumping ground for the world’s dirtiest vehicles.” While the plans have yet to be officially released in their final form, any New South Wales push to pass CO2 emissions standards may force the hand of the federal government. The move signals an evolving states-based approach on the issue of fuel efficiency and emissions regulations after decades of inaction by federal Labor and Liberal governments. After four years of consultation, the Morrison government released its “future fuels” strategy paper in February that was immediately slammed as a “do nothing“ document for rejecting stricter fuel efficiency standards. Should Victoria follow suit and introduce a plan to harmonise its fuel efficiency and emissions regulations with Europe, the country’s two largest regional economies would be covered by a stricter regulatory standard than that at a federal level.   Related: Australia lags the world on electric vehicle choice and it's hurting take-up, industry says   Victoria’s Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning was contacted for comment but did not respond by deadline. Australia’s loose attitude on noxious and CO2 emissions has made the country an outlier within the global vehicle market. Thanks to the regulatory black hole the country has become a dumping ground for thirsty petrol and diesel vehicles that are becoming increasingly difficult to sell elsewhere. The idea of state governments acting independently met a mixed response from industry bodies such as the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries. Its chief, Tony Weber, said that his organisation supported stricter emissions and fuel quality standards for Australian vehicles, but leaving it up to the states risked creating a patchwork of regulations across the country that would be bad for business. “In an ideal world we would have a CO2 target,” Weber said. “We believe there should be a CO2 target and that it should be at a national level. “We can’t have every state and territory going off on a whim. This needs to be handled at a federal level. That’s why we’ve put in a voluntary standard for our members which represents the manufacturers of 99% of vehicles sold in this country.” His comments were echoed by the Australian Automotive Dealer Association chief executive, James Voortman, who said it was up to the federal government to ensure a consistent standard. “I can’t blame the NSW government for doing this if they think this is the right way to go,” Voortman said. “The question of fuel efficiency standards has been looked at by Labor governments, Liberal governments and for a number of reasons they’ve decided not to act. “We’ve seen the manufacturers themselves have signed up to a voluntary vehicle emissions standard. “So it’s something our manufacturers support and it’s something dealers support, and we’re increasingly noticing that it’s something customers want. If you take a close look there’s another story about the growth of hybrid vehicles, that’s been the standout over the last 12 months. So the demand is there.”\\n\",\n",

       "  'full_article': 'A woman stopped me in the lane, to say she’d heard a bird in pain, I wondered if it was too late, to go there and investigate. The woman had been distressed by what sounded like the thrashing of wings, in a field behind a tall hedge up at the top of the lane. I had an idea. The day was murky and damp but celandines and primroses in the hedgebank cancelled out the chill. From the lane, an instinctively animal sound – a panicky banging against something hard – could be heard. It might have been a trapped bird and it felt urgent enough to do something about, so there was a compulsion to trespass. There was a way into the field through a little copse around a spring head, over a wire fence and then over a stile. The tattered pennants of maize plants were still in rows; they were last year’s cover crop for pheasants, who were attracted there by feeding stations. During a shoot, birds seeking refuge in the maize would be beaten, scared into the air, to fly towards the guns. It was one of those places that felt wrong.    One of the pheasants observed in Wenlock Edge. Photograph: Maria Nunzia @Varvera   Two or three hen pheasants rocketed away from the plastic drum feeders and a couple of cocks ran for cover. Beneath the feeders the ground was smoothed, flat as a dancefloor. Checking there was not a bird in distress or trapped inside the feed drum, I came to the realisation of what was going on. The pheasants were aware that, even though feeding had stopped months ago, there was still some seed inside the drum. They could get underneath and flap hard to put their heads through the hole – and the beating of their wings would also loosen some of the seeds inside, which then would fall through the hole for them to eat. I like pheasants. It’s not their fault that millions of them are reared in captivity and released into the countryside every year to be shot or run over. It’s not their fault they have a devastating impact on reptiles, amphibians and other wildlife. Pheasants are learning survival skills, turning the system that exploits them to their advantage.

       "  'full_article': 'Not long before he was elected as India’s prime minister in 2014, Narendra Modi spoke of his dreams of a “digital India”, where “access to information knows no barriers”. But this week, unprecedented barriers on every form of digital content, from online news to social media and films and television on streaming platforms, came into force, making India’s digital realm one of the most heavily regulated of any major democracy. The series of sweeping new IT rules bring almost everything that happens online under a mechanism of government regulation, including giving the government powers to remove “objectionable” online content and erasing people’s right to privacy on social media and encrypted messaging apps like WhatsApp. The move has provoked a huge backlash among the world of tech and media and a legal challenge against the rules was raised in Delhi high court this week by several online publishers.   Related: Indian journalists face criminal charges over police shooting reports   “The new rules take democracy and free speech in a very alarming direction, all under the guise of promoting online safety and making India more secure,” said Riana Pfefferkorn, a research scholar at the Centre for Internet and Society at Stanford Law School. With tech companies now ordered by the government to proactively monitor what people say on their platforms – and keep data on the identity of those users which could then be handed over to the government on demand – Pfefferkorn said it would “exert a chilling effect on what people are willing to say and do online if they know they’re being watched.” “Providers are being pressed to take down content the Indian government deems illegal or a threat to India’s security – categories that now seem to include criticising the Modi government,” she said. A crackdown on dissent The government has insisted that the new rules level the playing field, and regulate online content in the same way as traditional newspapers, television and film. A press note accompanying the announcement of the rules called them “progressive” and “liberal”. “We want them to be more responsible, more accountable,” said IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad of digital platforms. Yet even India’s mainstream media, which is rarely outspoken against the government, expressed concern, an editorial in The Hindu newspaper called the new rules “a wolf in watchdog’s clothing” and described them as “deeply unsettling as they will end up giving the government a good deal of leverage over online news publishers and intermediaries”. The Editors Guild of India put out a damning statement over the weekend which said the rules “fundamentally alter how publishers of news operate over the internet and have the potential to seriously undermine media freedom in India”. Many see the rules as a continuation of Modi’s government authoritarian crackdown on dissent. Freedom of the press and freedom of expression has been heavily curtailed since Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came to power, with mainstream media largely within the government’s grasp, but it is online news platforms who have become one of the last bastions of independent journalism. Social media, such as Twitter, is also used as a vital organising and information tool for anti-government actions, such as the huge farmers’ protests which have been going on in India since November. In turn, the government has attempted to control the platforms, by demanding for example that Twitter remove thousands of accounts critical of the government and threatening their staff with arrest if the company did not comply.    A protesting farmer checks his mobile phone as he rests along a blocked highway. Photograph: Prakash Singh/AFP/Getty Images   Indeed, controlling access to the digital realm has become a regular tool for curbing dissent by Modi’s government. This year, for the third year in a row, India topped the global list for most internet shutdowns, according to digital rights group Access Now. Of the 155 internet shutdowns that happened around the world in 2020, 109 of them were in India. ‘Palpably illegal’ The rules will fundamentally change how big tech companies like Facebook, which owns WhatsApp, and Twitter, operate in India, one of the world’ largest and most lucrative markets. So far the tech companies have remained quiet on whether they will comply, but internet company Mozilla said the “ripple effects of these provisions will have a devastating impact on freedom of expression, privacy and security”. “They call these rules self-regulation,” said Prasanth Sugathan, legal director at the Software Freedom Law Centre. “But when you have a regulatory mechanism that ultimately ends with a government body who can remove any content that it decides is problematic – perhaps because it is critical of the government – then that self-regulation can quickly turn into state censorship,” Indian digital news platforms The Wire.in and The News Minute are among those who have challenged the IT rules in court this week, in a petition presented to the Delhi high court, arguing they are “palpably illegal”. Siddharth Varadarajan, Editor of TheWire, described the rules as an “oppressive architecture”, which, by giving the government the power to delete or modify content, granted them “powers that run counter to the constitutional guarantee of press freedom.” “We have argued that this runs the danger of adversely affecting fundamental rights,” said Dhanya Rajendran, editor of the News Minute.   Related: Amazon Prime drama agrees to changes after Hindu nationalist pressure   The impact of these regulations is already being felt. Streaming platforms like Amazon Prime and Netflix, which were previously outside government control, will now be subject to the same strict regulation of their content and this week, Amazon Prime cancelled two upcoming shows. “The Indian government is trying to dictate what is and is not acceptable to say online, and inducing tech providers to censor their users as the cost of continuing to do business in India,” said Pfefferkorn.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'Bronze age burial site in Spain suggests women were among rulers',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'A burial site found in Spain – described by archaeologists as one of the most lavish bronze age graves discovered to date in Europe – has sparked speculation that women may have been among the rulers of a highly stratified society that flourished on the Iberian peninsula until 1550BC. Since 2013, a team of more than a dozen researchers have been investigating the site of La Almoloya in the southern Spanish region of Murcia. Home to the El Argar, a society that was among the first to utilise bronze, build complex urban centres and develop into a state organisation, the site is part of a vast territory that at its peak stretched across 35,000 sq km. Research published on Thursday in the journal Antiquity has documented one of the site’s most tantalising finds: a man and a woman buried in a large ceramic jar, both of whom died close together in the mid-17th century BC.    The remains of a man and a woman in a large ceramic jar have been found at La Almoloya. Photograph: Cambridge University Press   Buried with them were 29 valuable objects, nearly all of them belonging to the female, believed to be between 25 and 30 years of age. “It’s like everything she touched had silver on it,” said Cristina Rihuete of the Autonomous University of Barcelona. Among the exquisitely crafted items were bracelets, rings and a rare type of crown, known as a diadem. In total 230 grams of silver were found at the burial site – an amount that at the time would have been worth the equivalent of 938 daily wages. The prominent role women may have played in the society is echoed in other finds at El Argar; similar diadems were found at four other female burial sites while gravesites of women were later used for the burials of elite warriors, suggesting these sites were viewed as places of high status.    A bronze age ear plug and spiral found at La Almoloya in Murcia. Photograph: Cambridge University Press   What made this most recent find unique was its location beneath what could be the first bronze age palace unearthed in the region. As the building would have been used for political purposes, it could be that the woman’s power stemmed from politics, said Rihuete. Men were probably the warriors of society, as suggested by the swords found at several male burial sites, said Roberto Risch of Autonomous University of Barcelona. “Clearly they control the means of violence and they are probably behind the expansion of El Argar.”   Related: Islamic 12th-century bathhouse uncovered in Seville tapas bar   The society, which thrived from 2200BC onwards, was highly organised with a wealthy elite that was probably sustained by some sort of tax system. “In western Europe there was nothing of the like,” said Risch, pointing to the rest of Spain where people at the time were living in self-sufficient communities of 50 to 100 people. By the 16th century BC, all of El Argar’s settlements were abandoned, believed to have been racked by internal uprisings. “Shortly after the woman dies, the whole settlement is burned down,” said Risch. “And not until the Greeks and Phoenicians arrive on the Iberian peninsula did we see anything similar, either in architecture or in political dimension.”\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'Indigenous leaders accuse ACT of trying to cover up strip-search of sexual assault survivor',\n",
       "  'full_article': \"Indigenous leaders have accused the Australian Capital Territory of trying to cover up the alleged forcible strip-searching of a sexual assault survivor by having footage of the episode suppressed. On Wednesday the ACT government sent lawyers to the bail hearing of a 37-year-old Indigenous woman, who alleges she was forcibly strip-searched by guards in full riot gear in the territory’s jail, the Alexander Maconochie centre, this year. The government’s lawyers successfully argued to have footage of the strip-searching kept from public view, saying it may cause reprisal attacks on the guards. The woman, meanwhile, has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder allegedly as a result of the ordeal. She has a serious heart condition, of which prison authorities were forewarned, and was stripped in front of male detainees, despite being a sexual assault survivor.   Related: Aboriginal man died from asthma attack after 'unreasonably delayed' response from prison staff   Guardian Australia understands that the woman wants the footage made public. On Thursday the ACT’s Aboriginal health service, Winnunga Nimmityjah, condemned the territory’s suppression of the footage. Julie Tongs, Winnunga’s chief executive, accused the government of a cover-up. “The incident involving the strip search of this extremely vulnerable, traumatised Aboriginal woman, with serious health issues and a survivor of rape should be a catalyst for change, not a cover-up,” she said. “This incident demands, as a minimum an independent, external investigation. Nothing else will satisfy the Aboriginal community or any fair-minded person concerned to ensure that Aboriginal peoples are treated fairly and equally. As a first step, if the ACT government really does have nothing to hide, release the CCTV.” An ACT government spokesperson said the incident was “very serious” and had been thoroughly reviewed by ACT Corrective Services. The corrections minister, Mick Gentleman, has already referred the incident to the inspector of correctional services to ensure an independent review takes place. “These allegations have also been brought to the attention of the Human Rights Commission,” the spokesperson said. The ACT supreme court justice Michael Elkaim denied the woman bail, and suppressed his reasons for doing so until after her trial. That decision came despite an argument from her lawyers, Ken Cush & Associates, that she would comply with strict bail conditions and that her circumstances had changed, given the strip-searching and subsequent PTSD diagnosis. The woman said she was struggling with the death of grandmother in the lead-up to the incident and that she had initially been told she would be released to attend the funeral. But that permission was revoked at the last-minute, she says, causing her to become “very upset”. She says prison authorities tried to move her to a restricted unit in the jail but she was distressed at the prospect of going back into isolation. “Here I ask you to remember that I am a rape victim, so you can only imagine the horror, the screams, the degrading feeling, the absolute fear and shame I was experiencing,” she wrote in a letter recounting the ordeal. The ACT’s jail was built with the intention of being human rights compliant. Critics say it has failed comprehensively in that aim. Winnunga points to the territory’s high Indigenous incarceration rate as one indicator of this failing. The ACT’s Indigenous incarceration rate is now the highest in the country, and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples are 19.4 times more likely to go to prison than the general community. With respect to the suppressed footage, Tongs said “what you will see is horrible and it will reveal the government not just for its hypocrisy but the extent of its failure to take seriously the needs of the Aboriginal community of Canberra”. The ACT government was contacted for a response.\\n\",\n",

       "  'title': 'HSBC tables company vote on phasing out financing of coal',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'HSBC has bowed to investor pressure by ramping up its climate commitments and tabling a shareholder vote on plans to phase out coal financing by 2040. Fifteen pension and investment funds, led by the campaign group ShareAction, have agreed to withdraw their own environment resolution ahead of HSBC’s annual general meeting on 28 May. The investor group – which included Europe’s largest asset manager, Amundi, and Man Group, one of the world’s biggest publicly-listed hedge funds – put pressure on the bank HSBC to reduce those loans and underwriting services offered to clients that relied heavily on fossil fuels. The timeline for action was to be consistent with Paris climate goals. HSBC’s vote will be binding if it gains the approval of 75% of shareholders. The bank is Europe’s second largest financier of fossil fuels after Barclays, according to the Rainforest Action Network (RAN). While HSBC recently pledged to shrink its carbon footprint to net zero by 2050, the plan stopped short of a blanket ban on financing coal power. The new special resolution put forward by its board will commit HSBC to phasing out financing for coal-fired power and thermal coal mining across the EU and OECD by 2030, and across the world by 2040. A full policy will be published at the end of the year and progress reports will be released annually, including details of the bank’s methodology. HSBC is promising to use climate scenarios that do not project reduced emissions achieved by technologies that claim to remove carbon from the atmosphere. HSBC would be the first mainstream bank to exclude these so-called negative emissions technologies from its calculations. The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said the technologies are unproven and has warned that “reliance on such technology is a major risk in the ability to limit warming to 1.5C”. The bank’s chief executive, Noel Quinn, said he was pleased that campaigners had agreed to support the vote. “This represents an unprecedented level of cooperation between a bank, shareholders and NGOs on a critical issue.” HSBC’s decision to file its own vote follows similar moves by Barclays, which was targeted by the first ever climate vote against a UK bank last year. However, activists did not withdraw their own proposals at Barclays’ AGM in 2020. “Today’s announcement shows that robust shareholder engagement can deliver concrete results and sets an important precedent for the banking industry,” said Jeanne Martin, senior campaign manager at ShareAction. “Our focus now turns to ensuring it delivers on these commitments.”\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'How Australia stripped alleged Isis fighter of citizenship without evaluating her case | Rayner Thwaites',\n",
       "  'full_article': \"New Zealand authorities are still refusing to comment publicly on the likely deportation from Turkey of Suhayra Aden, the former Australian-New Zealand dual citizen alleged by Turkish authorities to be an Islamic State terrorist. But according to one report, it is likely New Zealand officials will eventually escort her from Turkey, along with her two children, aged two and five. Aden was arrested in mid-February trying to enter Turkey from Syria. Her detention triggered a diplomatic row when it emerged that Australia had stripped the 26-year-old of her Australian citizenship, leaving New Zealand to deal with her predicament. Born in New Zealand but having lived in Australia since she was six, Aden travelled to Syria on an Australian passport in 2014. Alleged to be involved with Isis, her Australian passport was cancelled in 2020. The timing of her actual loss of citizenship is less clear.   Related: Ardern blasts Morrison for shirking responsibility for suspected Isis terrorist who grew up in Australia   Media coverage has largely centred on New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern’s accusation that, in stripping Aden of her citizenship, Australia has “abdicated its responsibilities”. Ardern was right. But what has been less well covered is how the Australian government disabled itself from making a decision – let alone an informed one – on that loss of citizenship. Aden lost her citizenship automatically under a now-repealed law. That law deprived her of her citizenship without any Australian official evaluating her circumstances. An automatic rule Introduced under Tony Abbott’s prime ministership, the powers of citizenship deprivation were enacted in December 2015, early in the Malcolm Turnbull government. Automatic loss of Australian citizenship could occur if:  The person was aged over 14 They would not be rendered stateless (Aden’s New Zealand co-citizenship ensured this) They had either fought for a declared terrorist organisation or engaged in “disallegient” conduct (defined with reference to various terrorist offences, though not incorporating key elements of those offences)  A person lost their Australian citizenship the instant the statutory conditions were met, irrespective of any official knowing this had occurred. Of course, officials could only act when they found out the relevant conditions had been met – but that might be years later, if ever. So, for example, a person could be denied a passport on the basis they no longer had citizenship. But a person’s loss of citizenship did not wait on any official action or decision. The Australian government adopted these “automatic” mechanisms in part to avoid any “decision” being subject to judicial review. Legally, it is harder to challenge an automatic statutory change to a person’s rights or status than one decided by an official. As the Australian independent national security legislation monitor (INSLM) put it, those statutory provisions lacked “the traditional and desirable accountability which comes from a person taking responsibility for making a reviewable decision”. That lack of accountability was the point. No national security assessment As the INSLM heard during hearings in June 2019, the Australian government did not necessarily know who had lost their Australian citizenship or when. This considerably complicated the counter-terrorism work of Australian police and intelligence services. The INSLM found the uncertainty created by an automatic procedure might impede criminal prosecutions or cause them to fail. Responding to Ardern’s criticisms, Scott Morrison argued it was his job “to put Australia’s national security interests first”.   Related: Peter Dutton's push to use 'secret evidence' to revoke citizenship condemned   The problem was, no national security assessment had preceded Aden’s loss of citizenship. The statute neither required nor allowed for any contextualised assessment of a person’s circumstances or the broader implications of depriving them of citizenship. The first job of the relevant Australian officials was to mop up – to find out as best they could what the statute had already done, to whom and when. A failed policy Discussing the prospect of terrorist fighters leaving a conflict zone and returning to Australia, the Department of Home Affairs observed:  In managing the risk presented by these individuals to Australia’s safety and security, a suite of measures, that are sufficiently nuanced and can be applied on a case-by-case basis, is paramount.  The provisions that deprived Aden of her citizenship emphatically failed to deliver on this policy objective. None of this is to say the Australian government’s hands were tied. Even under the now-defunct legislative provisions that provided for an automatic process, the home affairs minister had the power “at any time” to make a determination to “exempt the person from the effect” of the automatic citizenship deprivation provisions. The Australian government belatedly responded to the counterproductive consequences of the “automatic” process by repealing the relevant provisions and replacing them with a model based on ministerial decision. But by the time those amendments came into force in September last year, Aden had lost her Australian citizenship and New Zealand was her only legal home.

       "  'title': 'Generation review – ambitious, sexually fluid teen show rings hollow',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'There were several moments in the pilot of Generation (styled Genera+ion), HBO Max’s spunky rejoinder to HBO’s popular Euphoria, that made me laugh out loud, and not in a good way. The half-hour dramedy about free-wheeling, sexually fluid high schoolers somewhere outside Los Angeles, from the father-daughter team Daniel and Zelda Barnz and co-producer Lena Dunham, aims for slick edginess but too often devolves into strained nonsense. There’s teenage Naomi (Chloe East) moaning, in apparent seriousness, during an emergency: “titty fuck cunt nuggets, it’s not loading! Oh God, it’s one of those YouTube videos where you have to watch the whole fucking ad first!” Or dress-code flouting Chester (Justice Smith) delivering the would-be mic drop “I’m like … a lot,” to a flirtatious guidance counselor (Nathan Stewart-Jarrett).   Related: Rebels with a cause: how teens on screen grew up and found their voice   But the one that made me literally gasp came towards the end of the pilot, when Riley (Chase Sui Wonders), tries to assuage Nathan’s (Uly Schlesinger) guilt over hooking up with his sister’s boyfriend with the line: “If I had a sister, I would literally do nothing but fuck her boyfriends.” As a person with sisters and also just as a person: um, no? That reaction coursed throughout the four episodes made available for critics of Generation – an ambitious but muddled, often cringeworthy show that frequently mistakes shock or bluntness for subversion. The 16-part series (the second batch of eight episodes will air on HBO Max later this year) attempts to transpose the usual teen-show markers – hookups, unrequited crushes, drug experimentation, oppressive parents – to the social media and image-saturated late 2010s. The flurry of pop culture references and internet slang belie input from a real teenager; Zelda Barnz was 17 years old when the series was picked up. (Her father Daniel Barnz’s writing-directing credits include 2014 Jennifer Aniston indie Cake and Beastly). But the show’s shaky, unnecessarily Bourne-esque direction, over-reliance on “artsy” shots (multiple underwater cams) and broad strokes writing frequently undercut its ambition.    Of the four previews, the first and fourth unspool in shifting perspectives to build up tension, a hollow trick that muddies an already confusing web of characters. At the center appears to be Chester, a queer, brashly confident water polo star whose no-fucks wardrobe (tiny sunglasses, bleached hair, crop tops) overcompensates for Smith’s overacting. Chester hangs out with Riley, an aspiring photographer from a rich family, who tries to set up Nathan, reeling from his dalliance (read: Snapchat dick pics) with sister Naomi’s boyfriend, with Chester. Naomi frets about blowjobs with Arianna (Nathanya Alexander), who theatrically rebels, with consistently the most disingenuous lines, against her two fathers (John Ross Bowie and J August Richards). There is a subplot involving Nathan and Naomi’s conservative, religious parents (Martha Plimpton and Sam Trammell); and it will not be surprising that in a later episode, Plimpton’s character bemoans kids these days and their pronouns as a way of seeking attention. Each episode opens with an in medias res gimmick: a scene set three months ahead of the rest of the first episode, that tries to wring off-kilter humor and intrigue out of a bizarre predicament in a mall food court (teens still go there, I guess?). The whole bit would be laughably obscene would the situation not be so deeply traumatic in real life. It’s perhaps unfair but impossible not to compare Generation to Euphoria, its glittery, hyper-dramatic half-hour cousin. Both strive for relevance to today’s teens with in-your-face imagery (in Euphoria, full-frontal nudity and graphic depictions of drug addiction; in Generation, dick pics), frequent depictions of texting/sexting, and a baseline assumption of sexual and gender fluidity. But whereas Euphoria drew fans for its deceptive depth, especially the groundbreaking, organic relationship between trans teen Jules, played by Hunter Schafer, and Zendaya’s Rue, Generation rings hollow, its characters more woke-signalling pieces on a ludicrous plot board than reflections of real people.    There are a few bright spots. Haley Sanchez, as Greta, gives one of the few convincing performances as a Latina teen in a family separated by inhumane US immigration laws, jittery and consumed by her unrequited crush on Riley. It’s refreshing to see a show incorporate Gen Z staples such as text flirtations and Snapchat without much fanfare, even if said incorporation slides into grating lines. And the handling of sexual and gender fluidity as a casual, baseline assumption, rather than a major plot point, should be a standard for teen shows going forward. But the performative over-emphasis on self-conscious progressivism, with lines that make a woke joke out of asshole behavior (“In no way am I paying 10 cents for these – reparations!” Arianna shouts while stealing cups from a lemonade stand), play like a callous shield for underdeveloped storytelling, no matter how good their intention. I am here for young people getting an opportunity to produce their work, for casts that are diverse and more queer than not, for shows that attempt to wrangle the diffuse, confusing galaxy of screens and social media into a coherent narrative. Generation is, hopefully, a step in the right direction for representation and ambition in teen shows. Unfortunately, that’s not an excuse to treat characters with disingenuousness, nor is surface-level progress the recipe for a good watch.  Generation starts on HBO Max on 11 March with a UK date to be announced \\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'Fortnite creator Epic Games launches Australian legal action against Google',\n",
       "  'full_article': \"Epic Games has launched new legal action against Google in Australia over alleged anti-competitive behaviour after Fortnite was kicked off the Google Play store last year. It is the second such court action Epic has taken in Australia following similar court action against Apple, launched in November last year. Fortnite was kicked off both the Apple App Store and Google Play Store in August last year after Epic bypassed the companies’ in-app payment methods in favour of its own cheaper direct billing that prevented Apple and Google taking a share, typically around 30% of the purchase price. The company has since launched legal action in the US, the UK and Australia, and has filed an antitrust complaint against Apple in the EU.   Related: Facebook news ban fears grow as tech giant fails to sign deals with Australia's big media players   In documents filed in the federal court on Wednesday, Epic alleges Google has harmed app developers and consumers in Australia by restricting competition and innovation through preventing choice over app distribution and in-app payments on Android devices. “Google’s conduct inflates the price for apps and in-app content for millions of Android device users in Australia,” the filing stated. Unlike Apple’s closed-garden iOS operating system, it is possible to download apps to Android devices outside of the Google Play Store by going to the app developer’s website. This means it is still possible to download Fortnite onto Android devices, but Epic stated in the filing that Google “imposes technical barriers” on direct downloading, including security warnings sent to users who try to do so. Direct downloads of apps do not allow for developers to push out updates, the filing noted. Epic Games accused Google of misusing its market power and engaging in exclusive dealing. Epic founder and CEO Tim Sweeney said in a statement Google had “given the illusion” of being open by arguing about the existence of alternative app stores and direct downloads on Android, but these alternative methods of app downloads were rarely used. “The barriers Google places on Android OS are real. In the case of direct downloading, it makes the process so difficult and scary that it deters users from downloading apps from third party-websites even though it is a totally normal way for users to get apps on a desktop,” he said. “We believe consumers have the right to install apps from sources of their choosing and developers have the right to compete in a fair marketplace.” Google declined to comment. In August, an Apple spokesperson said Epic’s actions in seeking to bypass the in-app purchasing system were expressly about violating App Store guidelines designed to protect customers. “Their reckless behaviour made pawns of customers, and we look forward to making this clear to Australian courts,” she said. An interlocutory hearing for the Apple case is set down for 23 March and the first Google case management hearing is set for 24 March. Justice Nye Perram, who is overseeing both cases, earlier this month set aside a notice to produce from Epic to Apple seeking a wide variety of information about the Apple app store, including the number of Australian users, apps available, and earnings both in the store and through in-app purchases. The US court case is set to go ahead in May.\\n\",\n",

       "  'full_article': 'The wife of an Australian citizen who is to be extradited to Saudi Arabia says she “hopes a miracle will happen” after a Moroccan court approved his transfer. International lawyers acting for Osama al-Hasani, 42, have asked United Nations special rapporteurs to raise his case with Moroccan authorities, citing “credible concerns” that he was being targeted by the Saudi Arabian government for his political opinions. The Australian government confirmed on Thursday it was in contact with Moroccan authorities about the matter and that an Australian embassy official had visited him. “The circumstances of his detention and possible extradition are of concern to Australia,” a spokesperson for the foreign affairs department said. Al-Hasani – a dual Australian and Saudi citizen – was detained shortly after he arrived in Morocco on 8 February in connection with an extradition request from Saudi Arabia. His wife, Hana al-Hasani, said he was detained just hours after meeting his newborn child. She told the Guardian on Thursday: “I can’t describe my feeling. I was just told today that I could visit my husband tomorrow for the first time since he was arrested and now I am being told that this maybe my last visit and even maybe the last time I could see him alive.   Related: Australian facing extradition from Morocco to Saudi Arabia arrested hours after meeting his baby, wife says   “The fact that he will be extradited to Saudi Arabia means simply that he is going to be tortured and maybe worse than that, things I don’t want to think about right now. “I still hope a miracle will happen and I still have trust that this country has wise people in charge, led by the king of Morocco, that will not allow this to happen. She said al-Hasani was a father of four. She said his youngest child turned five months old the day his father was in court. “And I really hope the Australians will succeed in moving something and taking him [al-Hasani] home, to be safe and secure.” A report published by a Moroccan news site has previously alluded to accusations that al-Hasani was accused of organising opposition activity to Wahhabism, the state-sponsored form of Sunni Islam in Saudi Arabia, but his supporters have argued that he “he has no relation to any political opposition activity”. SBS News quoted a Moroccan justice ministry official as saying the arrest took place following an Interpol notice filed by Saudi Arabia, adding that he was wanted by the Saudis for a penal code matter involving theft. Reuters claims a court there had previously sentenced him to two years in prison on theft charges, which he denies. A statement issued on Thursday on behalf of al-Hasani’s family said a Moroccan court had now approved his extradition to Saudi Arabia. “This is an extraordinary and disappointing decision,” the family’s statement said. The statement, issued by London-based lawyer Haydee Dijkstal, who is acting as the international counsel for al-Hasani, said the extradition was approved “despite urgent concerns raised of the real and credible risk to Mr al-Hasani’s fundamental rights, safety and security if he is extradited to Saudi Arabia”. Dijkstal said a representative of the Australian government was understood to have been present at the two hearings before the extradition decision was released, but al-Hasani was not present in the courtroom for either hearing. Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has said it is providing consular assistance. Dijkstal said the family was not aware of precisely when al-Hasani’s transfer to Saudi Arabia might happen “but are extremely worried that it might happen imminently”. “UN special rapporteurs are therefore called upon to take urgent steps to protect Mr al-Hasani’s life, security and rights by raising his case with the Moroccan authorities, and the government of Australia is called upon to publicly oppose the extradition of its own national to Saudi Arabia.” Australia’s foreign affairs department said it was providing consular assistance to an Australian man detained in Morocco and held concerns about the circumstances. “Our embassy in Rabat is in direct contact with local officials,” a spokesperson said. “The Australian government continues to engage with the Moroccan government on this matter.” The department would not provide further comment “owing to our privacy obligations”.\\n',\n",

       "  'full_article': 'The Senate on Wednesday confirmed Marcia Fudge to head the Department of Housing and Urban Development and Michael Regan to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, picking up the pace for confirmations in Joe Biden’s cabinet.   Related: Merrick Garland confirmed as attorney general, turning page on Trump era   Fudge, a veteran lawmaker and congresswoman from Ohio, will lead the housing agency just as Congress has passed new benefits for renters and homeowners who have suffered economic losses amid the coronavirus pandemic. She is also the first Black woman to run the agency in decades. Regan, who has served as North Carolina’s top environmental regulator since 2017, will help lead Biden’s efforts to address climate change and advocate for environmental justice, two of the administration’s top priorities. He is the first Black man to run the EPA.    Michael Regan testifies on his nomination to lead the Environmental Protection Agency on 3 February. Photograph: Brandon Bell/AFP/Getty Images   Fudge, who has represented parts of Cleveland and Akron in the House since 2008, is a former mayor and a longtime advocate for assistance for the needy. She said at her confirmation hearing in January that her first priority would be protecting the millions of people who have fallen behind on rent or mortgages due to loss of income during the pandemic, telling senators that “we cannot afford to allow people in the midst of a pandemic to be put in the streets”. Shortly after she was confirmed, Fudge took the last vote of her House career in support of the $1.9tn Covid-19 relief bill, which will provide billions in housing assistance to low-income households.  The Senate also confirmed federal judge Merrick Garland as attorney general on Wednesday. All three nominees won bipartisan support for their nominations.

The Senate banking, housing and urban affairs committee chairman, Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat who lives in Fudge’s district, noted that Ohio suffered a disproportionate number of foreclosures even before the 2008 economic crisis. “She knows how for decades, communities have watched as factories closed, investment dried up and storefronts were boarded over,” Brown said. “And she knows how many neighborhoods and towns have never had the investment they should – because of discrimination, because of redlining, because of decades of policy that funneled resources and jobs away from Black and brown communities.” The Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, said Fudge “has a difficult job ahead of her” as millions of American renters are behind on payments and millions of homeowners are in forbearance. The Covid-19 relief bill provides about $30bn to help low-income households and the unemployed afford rent and utilities, and to assist the homeless with vouchers and other support. States and tribes would receive an additional $10bn for homeowners struggling with mortgage payments because of the pandemic. Regan is known in his home state for pursuing cleanups of industrial toxins and helping low-income and minority communities significantly affected by pollution. Senator Tom Carper, who is the chairman of the environment panel, said Regan had a proven record of forging “practical solutions to clean our air and our water, while building a more nurturing environment for job creation and job preservation”. One of Regan’s biggest challenges will be returning scientific integrity to an agency that, under former president Donald Trump, frequently allowed business groups and other special interests to “play a large role in crafting the agency’s policies”, Carper said. The confirmations were not without criticism from Republicans. The West Virginia senator Shelley Moore Capito, the top Republican on the environment panel, said Regan would return the EPA to the policy agenda of the Obama administration, an agenda she said “absolutely devastated my state and other energy-producing states”. Meanwhile, the Pennsylvania senator Pat Toomey criticized some of Fudge’s past comments about Republicans, saying they could have a “toxic and detrimental impact on the working relationship that ought to be a constructive relationship” between Congress and the Biden administration. Toomey referenced a statement Fudge made last year when GOP senators moved to fill the supreme court vacancy left by the death of justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg after blocking Obama’s nominee – Garland, the newly confirmed attorney general – four years earlier. Fudge at the time called Senate Republicans “a disgrace to this nation” and said they “have no decency, they have no honor, they have no integrity”. At her confirmation hearing, Fudge did not walk back any of her previous statements but described herself as “one of the most bipartisan members in the House of Representatives”.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': \"Aboriginal man died from asthma attack after 'unreasonably delayed' response from prison staff\",\n",
       "  'full_article': \"A 36-year-old Aboriginal man who died on the floor of prison from an asthma attack in 2018 was deprived of “at least some chance” of surviving by the “unreasonably delayed” response to his emergency by prison guards and health staff, the NSW coroner has found. But the coroner still found that Anaiwan-Dunghutti man Nathan Reynolds died of “natural causes” that were partly exacerbated by deficiencies in the management of his severe asthma. “Nathan’s medical crisis on the night of 31 August required an emergency response. But the response he received fell well short of this. It was confused, uncoordinated and unreasonably delayed,” the deputy state coroner, Elizabeth Ryan, said.   Related: NSW had two Indigenous deaths in custody last week, parliament told   “The delay deprived Nathan of at least some chance of surviving his acute asthma attack. These failures were due both to numerous system deficiencies and to individual errors of judgement.” During the inquest in October last year, the coroner was told that prison officers took about 10 minutes to respond to calls for help. Officer Matthew Fawzy told the court he had been waiting for a colleague to see Reynolds. When asked why this took roughly 10 minutes, he said: “I can’t think of anything.” When asked why he didn’t run to Reynolds, the prison officer said he had been trained to avoid that. “We were taught never to run unless it’s an officer actually getting assaulted,” Fawzy said. Taking Reynolds’ call at 11.27pm for help as the starting point, the coroner said it took more than eleven minutes for correctional officers to reach his side, 13 minutes for a nurse to be summoned, 22 minutes before a nurse arrived at his side and 47 minutes before ambulance paramedics attended him. “These time frames cannot be accepted as adequate or appropriate,” she said. During the inquest, fellow inmate Jeremy Preo, who was trained in first aid, cried as he told the coroner he placed Reynolds in the recovery position and did his best to open the man’s airways. “He’s done like a big gurgle and that’s when I started rubbing my arm on his back and said, ‘Mate, keep breathing’,” Preo told the NSW coroners court while wiping his eyes. “He was alive then. He could hear me.” But Preo said he was distressed when the nurse arrived and rolled Reynolds onto his back. “I’ve seen her ... slap Nathan in the face and aggressively shake him, and telling him to wake up,” Preo told the court. “The nurse then said to [prison officer John Fifita] that Nathan’s had a drug overdose.” The nurse said she asked other inmates what Reynolds had taken when she arrived on the scene about 11.50pm and saw his pupils were fixed. Wright told the court she gave him naloxone, which reverses the effects of a drug overdose.She said she did not recall anyone telling her about his asthma and denied slapping or shaking him. In delivering her findings, Ryan said the failures in Nathan’s care went beyond what happened that night. The care he received after entering custody four months before he died was “inadequate”. “It failed to reduce his risk for a fatal asthma attack. It did not comply with established treatment for the management of severe asthma. It did not even comply with NSW Health’s own policies to prevent chronically ill prisoners from deterioration and death. These failings significantly increased Nathan’s risk for the fatal attack which took his life on the night of 31 August,” Ryan said. However, she said her recommendations resulting from his inadequate care were “not focused on attributing blame”, and were “made in the hope that people like Nathan who enter custody with conditions of severe asthma will have a better chance of avoiding a life threatening attack, and of surviving one should it happen”.   Related: 'Why does it take so long?' The desperate wait for answers after a death in custody   Reynolds did not receive an assessment of his asthma or a management plan at the jail, despite the intake nurse noting his history of asthma, including that he had a nebuliser at home, when he was first admitted to the prison in May 2018. The nurse recommended that Reynolds’ asthma be assessed. A month later – even after he was hospitalised having suffered a severe asthma attack – the assessment still did not occur. The court heard that the intake nurse’s note recommending an assessment was at some point replaced with one saying Reynolds refused to go to the emergency department. Reynolds’ family demanded accountability from Justice Health and NSW Corrective Services for the failings in his care. “It’s soul-crushing knowing that at just 36 years old, Nathan died on the cold floor of a prison, separated from his family and loved ones. Words can’t describe our pain. “We are also angry because Nathan’s death was preventable. He would not have died if he weren’t in prison. This can’t just be treated as an accident – it must be recognised as a huge institutional failing and people must be held responsible.” Karly Warner, CEO of the Aboriginal Legal Service NSW/ACT, said processes in prisons to manage chronic health conditions “were hardly worth the paper they’re written on, as staff were either unaware of them or failed to follow them”. “In the four months he was in prison, Nathan’s health steadily deteriorated and there were clear signs that he was heading for an acute asthma attack. He was cut off from community healthcare and entirely in the hands of Corrective Services NSW and Justice Health, who failed in their responsibilities to him,” she said. “That failure cost Nathan his life. This is why we say that Aboriginal people’s lives are put at risk when they are sent to prison.” Three more Aboriginal people died in prisons over the past week, two in NSW and one in Victoria.\\n\",\n",

       "  'title': \"Three stories of hope: 10 years on from Japan's triple disaster\",\n",
       "  'full_article': 'On 11 March 2011 a magnitude 9.0 earthquake struck off Japan’s north-east coast, triggering a tsunami that killed more than 18,000 people. The tsunami destroyed more than 120,000 buildings and forced more than 450,000 people to live in temporary shelters. Damage to housing, businesses, roads and other infrastructure came to an estimated US$210bn, making it the costliest natural disaster ever. Damage done by the waves’ destructive power set off a triple meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, forcing tens of thousands to evacuate and turning nearby communities into ghost towns.    A decade later much has changed along the hundreds of miles of devastated coastline. Parks and public spaces have replaced buildings swept away by the tsunami, and new homes stand on elevated land. Evacuation orders have been lifted in some Fukushima neighbourhoods but the fraught operation to decommission the wrecked nuclear plant will take decades. As Japan prepared to mark the 10th anniversary, people from three communities spoke to the Guardian about the events of that day, what has changed since, and their hopes for the future. * * * Aki Sato Community organiser in Okuma “Recovery is about people taking control of their own lives, achieving something they can see with their own eyes.”    Aki Sato, a community organiser in Okuma, and her husband Nobuyasu, a strawberry farmer. Photograph: Kazuma Obara/The Guardian   Aki Sato was working in a Tokyo law office when the meltdown at Fukushima Daiichi forced residents of Okuma, 240km away, to flee. But she had more reason to worry than most people in the capital. “My grandmother was living in the next town and it took me two days to find out she was safe and staying at a gymnasium,” says Sato. Sato, who had started to tire of life in Tokyo, wondered what she could do to help. “Initially I couldn’t think of anything, then in 2014 I came to Okuma and found a job helping with the recovery effort here.”  map     Okuma Photograph: Kazuma Obara/The Guardian   By then the town had been empty for four years, although its 11,500 people – scattered across the country – were permitted to make short daytime visits. Today only 300 or so have made a permanent return since the evacuation order was lifted in 2019 and residents were once again allowed to stay overnight.  Okuma map  “I talked to lots of villagers who told me they were desperate to meet their old neighbours, so I decided to organise traditional music and dance performances to make that happen – to give people the sense that together they were taking control of their own destiny.” Sato produced a map showing the locations of cultural events, including the summer Obon festival, when people get together to sing and dance in honour of their “returning” ancestors. “It doesn’t really matter what kind of event it is, it’s about people doing something together again and getting back to their roots,” she says. “The word ‘recovery’ can be mentally exhausting … what does it mean exactly? For me it is about individuals taking control of their own lives, achieving something they can see with their own eyes.” Her emotional connection to the town grew even stronger after she married Nobuyasu Sato, who works as a production manager at a strawberry farm set up to boost the local economy. “You could say it’s a kind of ancestral curse, but it honestly never crossed my mind that I wouldn’t be able to come back,” says Nobuyasu. “I kept saying I would go home, even though my parents were more skeptical. It wasn’t a rational thing, just my stubborn side coming through. I couldn’t imagine living anywhere else.” * * * Muneo Kanno Rice farmer in Fukushima “Sake is important in Japanese culture … so it can also be part of Iitate’s recovery”    Muneo Kanno, a rice farmer in Fukushima. Photograph: Kazuma Obara/The Guardian   When the order came for the residents of Iitate village to leave, Muneo Kanno’s thoughts immediately turned to his cattle and crops. The triple meltdown at Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant had already forced the evacuation of tens of thousands of people living within 20km of the wrecked facility. But most of Iitate’s 6,000 residents stayed put, convinced they were safe since their homes were well outside the official evacuation zone.  map  The local authorities did not order an evacuation until several weeks later, after a radiation expert discovered multiple hotspots in the village 48km from the power plant. Kanno made regular visits home from the evacuation place to test his rice crops, but his wife would not return until the evacuation was officially lifted in 2017 following an unprecedented decontamination operation in Fukushima prefecture. Long before then, the region’s healthy cattle had been sent to other parts of Japan, while those found to contain unsafe levels of radiation were destroyed.  Iitate map  With his cattle long gone, Kanno decided to start growing rice to give his family, and his village, a fighting chance. “We have a duty to protect nature but it was damaged by the nuclear accident,” he says. “I thought that if I could grow rice here, then it would be really special.” Kanno worked with university researchers, measuring radiation data at regular intervals to ensure his crop met official safety standards. In 2019 his persistence paid off, and he sent his rice to a brewery in another part of the prefecture to be turned into the first batch of limited-edition sake, the word “recovery” emblazoned in red and yellow on the label. “My first thought was that I had to set myself a goal, and then reach it,” says Kanno, 70. “Sake is an important part of Japanese culture, so naturally I thought it could also be part of Iitate’s recovery.” He concedes that Iitate, once recognised as one of Japan’s most picturesque villages, is still associated with the dark days of the meltdown, even though Fukushima has one of the strictest food safety regimes in the country. “My aim is to keep doing what the science says and grow rice as a message of hope,” he says, adding that he plans to obtain a licence to brew the sake himself. In a region known for its sake, Kanno is confident that his “dry, crispy” junmai version can hold its own. “The conditions for growing rice are ideal, so naturally the sake is very good too,” he says. “If it puts a smile on people’s faces, that will be more than enough for me.” * * * Tokuji Abe Oyster farmer “As soon as I went out to sea for the first time since the disaster, I realised that this was the only job I could ever do.”    Tokuji Abe, third from left, his son Kazuya, far right, and their family in Minamisanriku. Photograph: Kazuma Obara/The Guardian   When his boat started rocking violently in the sea off Minamisanriku, Tokuji Abe thought something was wrong with its engine. It was only when he heard an alert on his VHF radio that he realised the cause was something far more sinister: the biggest earthquake the then 50-year-old had ever experienced.

Waves of up to 20 metres in height had destroyed most of Minamisanriku’s buildings and killed more than 800 of its 17,000 people. “Big fishing vessels had been carried inland and houses torn from their foundations,” Abe says. “I could barely believe what I was seeing. I was convinced that my family had all died.” He arrived in his neighbourhood to find that the family home had disappeared, and that his father had perished. “In a way it was a relief to know that my mother, wife and son had survived, although I feel sorry for my father when I say that.”  Minamisanriku  His boat was the only possession that had been spared, but no one in Minamisanriku was thinking of the future. “I could barely move. I couldn’t even begin to think about the business. I was exhausted. I couldn’t function.” As the months passed, Abe’s thoughts turned to the ocean and the livelihood it had given generations of his family. “The sea no longer had debris in it … it wasn’t perfect, but it looked like I might be able to start farming again,” he says. “I was starting all over again, but as soon as I went out to sea for the first time since the disaster, I realised that this was the only job I could ever do.” Last year the eldest of his three sons, Kazuya, quit his job in advertising to ensure the family business will continue for at least another generation. “I had always loved the sea and the thought of becoming a fisherman had never really left me,” Kazuya says. The ocean took almost everything from the Abes, but today it is once again the family’s friend. The clear, nutrient-rich water the tsunami left in its wake means it now takes farmed oysters a year, instead of the usual two or three, to grow into the plump, juicy specimens for which Minamisanriku is famous. “If you work with the sea,” Kazuya says, “you have to be mindful of its destructive power, but also grateful for what it can give back.”\\n',\n",

       "  'title': \"Queensland passes laws banning 'killer' single-use plastics \",\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Queensland has become the second Australian state to pass laws banning single-use plastics including straws and cutlery that are blighting the state’s waterways and beaches and endangering wildlife. Environmental groups congratulated the Queensland government after it passed legislation on Wednesday night that will ban single-use plastic items, including polystyrene food containers and cups, from 1 September. The state’s environment minister, Meaghan Scanlon, said the state had seen benefits from its 2018 ban on single-use plastic bags, which had dropped 70% in litter surveys. The state’s container deposit scheme that gives a 10c return on most plastic and glass bottles, also introduced in 2018, was now approaching 3bn returned items.   Related: Deadliest plastics: bags and packaging biggest marine life killers, study finds   “Plastic pollution is spoiling our streets and parks, escaping into our ocean and waterways and killing our iconic wildlife,” Scanlon said. “Half of all plastic produced is designed to be used only once and then thrown away and that litter is destroying our environment.” South Australia was the first state to introduce a ban on single-use plastics, in September, with a similar list of items banned. Last week the federal government launched a national plastics plan that includes a phase-out by 2022 of expanded polystyrene packaging and food containers. Queensland’s ban covers single-use plastic straws, stirrers, cutlery and plates, and polystyrene food containers and cups. The laws exempt supply to people who need any of those items, such as people with disability or healthcare needs. Exemptions have also been made for plastic straws and spoons attached to food packaging, including drink cartons and yoghurts, though the minister said this would be reviewed. More items could be added under the legislation, Scanlon said, and consultation was continuing. Toby Hutcheon, of the Boomerang Alliance of more than 50 environmental groups, said he hoped to see coffee cups and lids and other plastic takeaway items, and heavyweight plastic bags joining the banned list. Hutcheon thanked the Liberal National party, the Queensland Greens and Katter’s Australian party for backing the law. The plastics included in the ban were among the most littered items in Queensland, he said, with the latest Clean Up Australia report from litter-pick days estimating 30% of all items collected were plastic packaging. He said the Australian Capital Territory, Victoria and Western Australia have also announced single-use plastic bans but have yet to put those into law. The best approach for the public, he said, was to avoid the use of single-use plastic items entirely, or to buy reusable or compostable versions. Shane Cucow, of the Australian Marine Conservation Society, said the laws were “fantastic news for Queensland’s turtles, whales and seabirds”. He added: “Every day we wait we lose more animal lives. We urge every state and territory to join Queensland and South Australia and ban single-use plastics this year. “With Earth-friendly alternatives now widely available, it’s time to ditch killer plastics throughout all of Australia.”\\n',\n",

A bright orange breast. Smart lime-green trousers. A blush-rose neck and yellow-tipped olive wings, with indigo accents at the edges. This is a good bird with large magenta eyes; it is majestic, strong and brave. We do not deserve this bird. We need this bird to be real. Please tell me some actual information about it. Sure, sure. The bird pops up on various platforms from time to time as we discover and rediscover the existence of beauty before promptly forgetting about it.

It is called a pink-necked green-pigeon, scientific name Treron vernans, and it is native to south-east Asia. The photo was taken by Chong Lip Mun.  First, this is indeed a real photo of a Pink-necked Green-pigeon, Treron vernans, native to parts of South East Asia. Yes, it's real, and it's beautiful.

Surely this is a dove. Great question. It is also a dove. Mosco, who is writing a book about pigeons, says: “Pigeons and doves belong to the scientific family Columbidae. Within that family, English-speaking folks basically name some species “dove” and some “pigeon” at random. Pigeons = doves. There’s no real taxonomic difference.” According to ebird.com, which I can only assume is an authority on the subject as I have opened no other tabs, the hot pigeon is a social, tree-dwelling bird which can also be found in “mangroves, open coastal forests, parks, gardens and plantation edges”. It is confined to parts of Thailand and Vietnam, as well as the Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, Cambodia, Myanmar and Indonesia.  so....handsome... pic.twitter.com/CGMTnNM3dL— shelby lorman (@sdlorman) March 8, 2021  What we’re looking at here is a male of the species as the females are “much plainer” (brutal), but both have “striking black-and-yellow wing feathers and yellow spotting on the undertail coverts”. Unfortunately its aesthetic splendour is not mirrored in its song: “Occasionally gives strange, alien-sounding coos,” ebird.com writes snidely. It is very upsetting that this pigeon is so beautiful when the pigeons that haunt my life are resolutely not. Well, first, your pigeons – “feral pigeons” – are also kind of cool if you just look at them for a minute.  While the rock pigeons that live in our cities don't get colors this vivid, they have their own rainbow. They can be red, brown, grey, white, black. Why? They are ferals descended from domesticated pets. Feral dogs are colorful for the same reason!

       "  'title': '$1,400 stimulus checks and vaccine funds: what the Covid relief bill contains',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'The US House on Wednesday passed the huge $1.9tn coronavirus relief and economic stimulus package that represents Joe Biden’s first major legislative victory.   Related: Biden poised for first major legislative victory with House vote on $1.9tn Covid relief – live   The massive legislation, a broadly popular bill with the public, received no Republican support. It aims to fulfill Democrats’ campaign promise to combat the coronavirus and revive a pummeled economy. It also includes sweeping anti-poverty measures that attempt to tackle deep-seated racial and gender inequalities in the American economy. Here are the main elements of the bill: $1,400 stimulus checks: A majority of Americans – as many as 85% of US households, according to Democrats – will receive direct payments of $1,400 per person. Individuals making less than $75,000 and married couples making less than $150,000 collectively would receive the checks. The payments would gradually decrease for those earning more than those income levels, with the benefit capped at $80,000 for individuals and $160,000 for married couples, who won’t receive checks. The threshold is lower than Biden had initially proposed, and was changed to accommodate objections from moderate Democrats in the Senate. Unemployment benefits: The bill extends through early September the $300-a-week federal unemployment benefits approved in a previous aid package. Biden proposed expanding the supplement to $400 a week through August, but the Senate kept it at $300, while extending the benefit through September. It also included a provision to make the first $10,200 of unemployment benefits received in 2020 tax-free for households earning less than $150,000. Child tax credit: The legislation significantly increases – and expands eligibility for – the child tax credit, a longtime progressive priority that Democrats are hoping to make permanent after the pandemic. Under the bill, the tax credit would jump from $2,000 a child under 17 to $3,600 for children up to age five and $3,000 for children aged between six and 17. Taken together with other benefits, it is estimated the expansion will halve the number of children living in poverty in America. Health insurance subsidies: The bill would temporarily increase financial assistance for health coverage purchased through marketplaces established by the Obama administration’s Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare. It also aims to help those who are unemployed keep their health coverage, as well as provides additional funding for military veterans’ healthcare and other health programs. Vaccine distribution and testing: The bill provides tens of billions of dollars to speed up vaccine distribution and administration, as well as increase coronavirus testing and enhance contact tracing and genomic sequencing. Pandemic response: The bill sends $350bn to state, local and tribal governments, to help offset deep budget shortfalls as a result of efforts to combat the pandemic. It also includes $130bn to help schools reopen safely by reducing class sizes and modifying classrooms to improve ventilation and social distancing. Colleges and universities would receive $40bn to help cover the cost of pandemic-related expenses. Businesses would also get funding, including under a new program to help bars and restaurants hurt by Covid lockdowns. Rental, mortgage and food assistance: The legislation also includes a number of other provisions that would provide assistance for food and housing, including money for low-income Americans to afford rent and pay their utilities, and aid to homeowners struggling to pay their mortgages because of the pandemic.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': \"'Not the NDIS we fought for': disability advocates fear new assessments driven by cost cutting\",\n",
       "  'full_article': \"Top disability advocates say a government plan to introduce “independent assessments” to the NDIS is aimed at cutting costs and will “fundamentally alter” the landmark scheme. A coalition of 20 disability advocacy groups and a peak body for service providers have added their voice to growing opposition to the new policy, which means NDIS applicants will undergo a free but mandatory assessment by a government-contracted allied health professional. Under the current process, applicants submit evidence from experts, including their specialists, but the government argues this has led to inconsistent funding outcomes and that obtaining the reports can be costly for people with disability.   Related: 'Uphill battle': for disability advocates, there's something missing in Hobart's Parliament Square   But in a statement issued on Thursday, the advocacy groups argue the changes “would fundamentally alter the individualised and personalised nature of the NDIS”. “While we all want greater consistency, we are very concerned this increasingly automated process will not adequately consider individual need and circumstance,” the statement said. “This is not the NDIS we fought for.” The groups, which included People With Disability Australia, Australian Federation of Disability Organisations and Every Australian Counts, will brief MPs about their concerns at a video conference on Thursday. Notably, the advocacy groups also said that based on the information that been released by the agency, they were “concerned that a desire to cut costs is the main motivation for the hurried introduction of these reforms”. They also argued the providers who would carry out the assessments would be contracted by the government, creating a conflict of interest. “The introduction of mandatory assessments is the biggest change to the NDIS since it began. Despite the scale and cost of the changes, they have not been rigorously tested or undergone an independent evaluation,” they said. “Consultation has been rushed and the questions and concerns of people with disability, their families and the organisations that support and represent them have not been addressed.” The NDIA is currently undertaking a consultation process on the reforms, while a parliamentary committee is also set to examine the changes. However, the government has said it plans to legislate to allow independent assessments to begin in mid-2021. Mel Tran, social entrepreneur and NDIS participant, said the scheme had a “long way to go” but that independent assessments were “not the answer”.   Related: ‘Urgent’ extension to disability inquiry 'ignored' by Morrison and Porter for four months   “The NDIS is a fundamental part of the lives of people with disability and it has meant so much to have an individualised approach to each person’s complex needs,” Tran, a chairperson at Children and Young People with Disability Australia, said. Dougie Herd, who helped campaign for the NDIS, said the mandatory assessments would “put people living with disability back in boxes based on an automated process”. “The NDIS was an idea that became a reality because of bipartisan leadership,” he said. “People with disability are looking for that leadership again.” The disability services sector has also rounded on the assessments, with David Moody, the chief executive of National Disability Services, also calling for the reforms to be halted. Moody said he was not confident the assessments would allow a “complete and accurate understanding of the functional abilities of people with ‘invisible’ or complex disabilities”.   Related: Backlash grows over 'independent assessments' plan for disability scheme   “The real worry for us is that these results cannot be challenged or appealed easily,” he added. “In fact, people will not be given a copy of the full assessment report unless they apply to see it and the hurdles that presents for a person with disability is unacceptable.” The NDIS estimates most assessments will last about three hours and applicants would be matched to “a therapist or clinician that has the right skills, experience and training to complete the assessment”. But Don Elgin, an ex-Paralympian who now works at Wallara Disability Support Services, said it would be difficult for some to articulate their needs “to a stranger in a three hour window”. “At worst it forces people to play the game of being disabled,” he said. Aaron Carpenter, who took part in the assessments pilot, told the Guardian last week he was asked many “yes or no” questions with little context and was assessed by a physiotherapist despite having autism. Last week, a coalition of 25 other disability organisations, including legal centres that help people navigate the system, also called for the assessments to be scrapped. The NDIS minister, Stuart Robert, has previously argued the reforms were based on the Productivity Commission’s original design for the scheme and were recommendations from the 2019 Tune review into the NDIS Act. He has argued the changes will make the system fairer and more consistent, and stressed that the government is consulting with the disability community about the changes. Robert released new data on Thursday morning showing significant disparities between the average plan sizes in different parts of Tasmania. The data showed Clark, which includes Hobart, had an average plan budget of $105,600, compared to Lyons and Franklin which averaged $70,200 and $68,900 respectively. Similarly, the average plan size for living in Launceston was $86,000, compared to $71,7000 for those in other parts of northern Tasmania. “Access to the NDIS and a NDIS participant’s plan should not be determined by your postcode and the data released today demonstrates we have a way to go to deliver a simpler, faster, fairer and more flexible NDIS in Tasmania,” Robert said on Thursday.\\n\",\n",

       "  'title': 'Griff, Pa Salieu and Rina Sawayama nominated for Brits Rising Star ',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'The nominees for the Brits Rising Star award, aimed at tipping the future of British pop, have been announced. Griff, Pa Salieu and Rina Sawayama are the latest cohort to follow in the footsteps of previous winners such as Adele, Florence + the Machine, Sam Smith, Jorja Smith and last year’s winner, Celeste. Most striking is Sawayama’s nomination. Until very recently, the 30-year-old pop star was not eligible for the Brit awards or the Mercury prize, both run by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), because the British-Japanese musician didn’t hold a British passport or dual citizenship, but indefinite leave to remain after 25 years spent living in the UK. After she highlighted her situation in July 2020, a BPI spokesperson said: “Both the Brit awards and the Hyundai Mercury prize aim to be as inclusive as possible within their parameters, and their processes and eligibility criteria are constantly reviewed.” On 24 February, the BPI announced that it had changed the eligibility criteria, stipulating that artists must meet at least one of the following requirements: being born in the UK, holding a UK passport or being permanently resident in the UK for more than five years. Beloved among fans for her clash of early 2000s pop styles with a nu-metal aesthetic, Sawayama she “fell to the floor” when she heard of her nomination. “I really can’t put into words how much this means to me given that I wasn’t eligible for this award a few weeks ago and now that door has been opened for future generations of artists like myself.” Elsewhere on the shortlist is Griff, AKA 20-year-old Hertfordshire songwriter Sarah Griffiths. She was previously nominated for the Ivor Novello Rising Star award, and came fifth on this year’s BBC Sound of 2021 poll.   Related: Griff: ‘I can’t think of anything worse than being like everyone else’   Citing Taylor Swift as an influence, Griff taught herself production and songwriting and signed with Warners in 2018. She has since released one EP and a steady stream of stylish electropop singles that bear the influence of Phil Collins-era pop – and which have earned the approval of Swift herself. In a statement, Griff recalled crying as she watched Stormzy’s landmark performance at the 2018 Brit awards. “I don’t think I really knew what that emotion was at the time, but I think it was just an overwhelming sense of aspiration. So to be nominated for a Brit award three years on is completely surreal.” Pa Salieu won this year’s BBC Sound of … ballot. Radio 1 DJ Annie Mac said the 23-year-old Coventry rapper had “a unique perspective on Britain”, telling “stories of friendship and family, of violence, exclusion and racism, and they act as timeless evidence of British street life at the turn of the new decade”. Guardian music critic Alexis Petridis said Salieu’s debut mixtape, Send Them to Coventry, had a unique musical footprint, tapping into the “ominous atmospherics of grime and the minimalism of dancehall” Salieu expressed his gratitude at the nomination. “Love and blessings every time! Thanks to everyone supporting my journey so far.” The Rising Star award is open to British artists who, as of 28 February 2021, have not yet had a Top 20 album or more than one Top 20 single. The winner will be announced on 19 March ahead of the ceremony on 11 May – delayed from its usual February date by the coronavirus pandemic.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'Imperial War Museums behind £2m project for new art on conflicts',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Imperial War Museums has announced a £2m project for new art commissions depicting conflict, continuing a role dating back to the first world war. The fund from royalties from Peter Jackson’s Academy Award-winning film They Shall Not Grow Old, which was commissioned by IWM, would ensure funding for more than 20 ambitious commissions bringing art to audiences across the UK, the museums said. Awards will range from £20,000 to £250,000. The scheme reflected one first set up by the wartime government in 1916, which saw war art on an unprecedented scale, with artists dispatched to the western front “creating a record for society”, said IWM’s head of art, Rebecca Newell. Thursday’s announcement was “a continuation of the engagement we have been supporting over the last 100 years”, with commissions covering artistic practice in the broadest sense possible, she added. The first world war government scheme saw a marked shift from the Napoleonic-style, Waterloo-type paintings that had previously dominated, when war art mainly commemorated British triumphs. “For the first time, artists were involved as soldiers, and older established artists sent out with the brief to record their experience, people’s experiences, to record what they saw, whether that was visceral or symbolic,” said Newell. Back then, the government decreed half of all works would go to national institutions, the bulk to IWM where they are exhibited still today, and some to the Tate. The rest would be dispersed to museums and galleries across the nation, making it art for the people. Muirhead Bone, an established Scottish artist known for his etched landscapes, was one of the first commissioned. William Orpen and John Lavery, both Irish and from the “glitterati of artists at that time”, were notable and influential in the field. Henry Tonks, a surgeon and watercolourist, most famous for his facial disfigurement works, was another. Stanley Spencer, Christopher Nevinson and brothers Paul and John Nash were all dispatched to the frontline.    Detail from A Tank (1917) by the war artist Christopher Nevinson. Photograph: CRW Nevinson/Imperial War Museum © Artists Estate   The emerging voice of modernism was evident in conflict art, especially from the Slade, in abstractionism and cubism. “So, alongside these established painters, there was this new language being championed, which we recognise as modernism now, but at the time was revolutionary-type art – all being collected for the nation. It was everyone’s collection,” said Newell. The IWM created its own first world war sub-scheme, in tandem with the government’s official scheme. This concentrated on the “home front” with a focus on women’s work, commissioning female artists and depicting scenes from areas such as nursing, ambulance driving, industry and laundry. Fast forward through the second world war, the cold war, the Falklands conflict, where Linda Kitson was an official artist, through to Iraq and Afghanistan, “and there is a direct line all the way through”, said Newell. Today the role of the war artist is completely different. “As a society, we understand conflict in a completely different way. For example, in WWI and WW2 there was clearly defined geography,” she said. When the censors ordered no depictions of dead enemy “there was a clearer understanding of enemy versus friend”, she added. Artists today had to try to understand the “disembodied nature of warfare” which blurred the lines, she said, such as the absence warfare created, and the “hidden enemy” such as improvised explosive devices. The challenge for new artists was how to capture some of those aspects of contemporary warfare – the seen and the unseen – which was the debate the IWM hoped its new commissioning would address. The commissions can include performative works, such as theatre or ballet, or film-making. For Iraq, the IWM commissioned the film-maker Steve McQueen, whose work Queen and Country, on the theme of repatriation, took sculptural form, with a wooden structure containing postage stamp-sized images of deceased and injured soldiers. In 2017, it commissioned the film Electrical Gaza by Rosalind Nashashibi. IWM will work in partnerships with cultural organisations to co-commission the new works as a continuation of its 14-18 NOW project set up to mark the centenary of the first world war. Diane Lees, IWM’s director general, said more than 300 million watched Jackson’s film. But much had changed since 2018, with museums and galleries closed due to the Covid pandemic. “Financially, we know first-hand how challenging it’s been for cultural organisations throughout this period, which makes us all the more delighted that this money was set aside in such a way that we’ve been able to support others.” Jenny Waldman, former director of 14-18 NOW, and now director of Art Fund, said of the Jackson film: “This fund is a tribute to his generosity and the enormous success of his film.”\\n',\n",

       "  'title': \"More heresy from Marks & Spencer with plan to sell rivals' clothing\",\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Marks & Spencer is committing heresy daily this week. First, it summoned a demolition squad to go to work on the fabled Marble Arch store in central London. Now it will sell other people’s clothing brands, including in lingerie, the one part of the non-food operation where market share has remained strong over the years. The venture into third-party labels is not quite an overnight revolution, it should be said. It is online-only and there has been some small-scale dabbling already. But the introduction of 10 outside brands in one go, including Hobbs, Jules, Sloggi and Triumph, is billed as the first of many waves. About time, too. M&S has tortured itself and its customers over the years with its attempts to develop in-house brands. Only three can be said to have worked and are staying – Autograph, Per Una and Goodmove. The rest (the likes of Collezione and Indigo) have been gradually ditched. It would have been better to import partnership-style thinking 20 years ago. The reluctance, presumably, stemmed from the lower profit margins on offer on external brands since, in some cases, M&S will merely be providing a souped-up delivery plus click-and-collect service. But the trend in the online clothing market is firmly away from solo offers and towards platform-style structures. Best to join in. The M&S adventure is less radical than Next’s push of its “total platform” unit, which is more like a full-service operation for outside labels, but at least it is happening. Insularity has been one of M&S’s many problems. As with the purchase of half of Ocado’s UK retail operation, taking a risk seems the right approach. The Restaurant Group’s post-pandemic prospects look more tasty Andy Hornby, at the helm when HBOS hit the rocks, is clearly better at saving casual dining chains than large banks. The pandemic prospects for The Restaurant Group (TRG), where he is the chief executive of the owner of Wagamama and Frankie & Benny’s, looked poor a year ago. A £57m fundraising last April was priced at a distressed 58p, versus 135p-ish before Covid struck. Wednesday’s £175m call on shareholders – the main course, as it were – was pitched a far more respectable 100p. What’s happened in the interim? Well, Hornby has performed a decent rescue job. The company has closed the tired Garfunkel’s format, plus a lot of other sites, and obliged landlords to take some pain at Frankie & Benny’s. The net result is a business with 400 outlets, rather than 650, meaning Wagamama – the reliable bit, and acquired only in 2018 – is now a bigger part of the whole. Fresh equity will make any future consumer lockdown more bearable and, more immediately, will de-risk the balance sheet. TRG is carrying £400m of debt, a legacy not just of Covid but also of the Wagamama purchase, and is paying an uncomfortable 6% to borrow. If the company can make top-line operating profits of £100m-£115m in 2022, which is what the analysts predict, the debt ratios would look normal again after this fundraising. All one can wish now is that TRG stops banging on about how Hornby and his fellow executives sacrificed a portion of their salaries during the crisis. Come on, they had no choice while the workforce was being shrunk by 4,500. More to the point, the share options Hornby was controversially awarded last October have doubled in value. Royal Mail delivers extraordinary turnaround A year ago, Royal Mail’s share price had slumped to 135p and it wasn’t hard to imagine that a political crisis might develop. After all, the chairman, Keith Williams, would soon warn that the UK business – in other words, the Royal Mail part, as opposed to the GLS international operation – was losing £1m a day with the plunge in the volume of letters. The share price now is 490p, an extraordinary turnaround. The boom in parcels has more than compensated for the decline in letters, which itself has turned out to be less severe than feared. The net result is that Royal Mail in the UK will now be profitable in the financial year that ends this month. In total, the group said on Wednesday, full-year operating profits are expected to arrive at £700m, an upgrade of about £150m on the estimate of only a month ago. The extended lockdown has helped. One lucky – or far-sighted – beneficiary is Daniel Křetínský, the Czech billionaire who caught the bottom of the share price, more or less, and accumulated a 14% stake, now worth £690m. He is virtually the only person who can truly claim to have seen the recovery coming.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'M&S to sell rival lingerie brands for the first time',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Marks & Spencer is to sell rival lingerie brands for the first time as part of a new initiative to boost sales on its website. The retailer, which already accounts for just under a third of UK underwear sales, is to introduce selected items from Sloggi and Triumph – the brand behind the world’s bestselling Doreen bra – alongside eight other new clothing labels debuting on its website over the next few months. Additional womenswear brands will include Hobbs, Joules, Phase Eight, Seasalt and White Stuff, as well as less well-known names including YAS and Sosandar. Menswear brand Jack & Jones will also be added to the roster. James Clark of the London College of Fashion said that introducing additional lingerie brands could give M&S access to a wider range of sizes without having to hold them all in stock. The alternative brands may also help M&S attract new shoppers. “Lingerie is a very intimate part of apparel and has very high brand loyalty, as once you adopt a brand, you know the fit and shape is right, particularly in bras,” Clark said. Marks & Spencer, which has relied on the pulling power of its own label for decades, took its first step into selling outside brands in October last year with the launch of independent eco-fashion label Nobody’s Child on its website. Items from Ben Sherman, Russell Athletic, Original Penguin and Elle Junior as well as exclusive product from Finery and Ghost are also now on the group’s website. The company also recently bought the Jaeger brand out of administration. M&S said the additional brands would attract new shoppers to its website and help it to expand. Nearly 10% of those who have bought Nobody’s Child had not bought womenswear from its site before. Neil Harrison, director of brands at M&S, said the new strategy was designed to “turbocharge online growth” by offering its 22m customers something new. “We need to give customers more choice and reasons to shop at M&S,” he said. M&S’s shift in strategy reflects similar moves at rival Next, which has signed a string of new brand partnerships in the past 18 months after gradually expanding the range of labels it sells via its website and catalogues. Both M&S and Next considered buying Topshop and both looked at lingerie brand Victoria’s Secret, before Next became its UK distributor for last year. On Wednesday, Next announced that it had bought a 25% stake in the Reiss fashion brand for £33m. The group will now manage Reiss’s distribution systems and website with the aim of increasing sales in the UK and overseas. The deal will bring former Next executive Christos Angelides, now chief executive of Reiss, back to the firm he left in 2014. Reiss, which operates from 183 outlets in 14 countries, had sales of £227m last year. The group’s current owners – including the Reiss family and investment firm Warburg Pincus – will all remain shareholders. Next has an option to acquire an additional 26% stake until July 2022, which would make it the controlling shareholder with 51%. \\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'Bowel cancer screening capsules the latest in at-home care trend',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'People will be able to check if they have bowel cancer by swallowing a tiny capsule containing miniature cameras, in an extension of patient self-care. In what experts described as a trend towards more NHS at-home care, hastened by the Covid-19 pandemic, thousands of people in England will be able to avoid the discomfort of having a camera inserted into their bowel by instead swallowing a capsule the size of a cod liver oil tablet. Pictures transmitted from inside their body during the painless procedure will help doctors judge whether the person has bowel cancer, the second deadliest form of the disease in the UK. The boss of the NHS in England said the procedure, known as a colon capsule endoscopy, is an example of “sci-fi” medicine increasingly deployed to improve care. One of the country’s top doctors said the capsules illustrated a major shift of healthcare out of hospitals that will see more and more diagnosis and treatment of illness done at home. “As we come out of ‘peak Covid’ and the disruption of the pandemic, the NHS is now pushing ahead with genuine innovation to expand services for many other conditions. That’s why we’re now trialling these ingenious capsule cameras to allow more people to undergo cancer investigations quickly and safely,” said Sir Simon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England. “What sounds like sci-fi is now becoming a reality, and as these minute cameras pass through your body, they take two pictures per second, checking for signs of cancer and other conditions like Crohn’s disease.” NHS England’s trial of the capsules, which are 2cm long, follows its decision last month to send 31,000 women in London a home kit to test for signs of cervical cancer and overcome the awkwardness and discomfort some women feel at having a smear test for the human papilloma virus with a nurse or doctor. Around 11,000 patients with potential symptoms of bowel cancer will be offered the option of swallowing a capsule as an alternative to having a standard endoscopy. The latter involves an invasive process in which a tiny camera mounted on a thin flexible wire is guided into someone’s body and then around their large bowel, where it takes pictures. In contrast, colon capsule endoscopy involves the patient visiting a nurse who fits a belt and receiver around their waist under their clothing to capture the pictures, before taking the capsule, going home and using laxatives to clean out their bowel so that the cameras can get clear images.    The ‘PillCam’, shown for size reference next to a pen Photograph: NHS England/PA   The process takes five to eight hours. Photographs of the bowel are sent wirelessly from the capsule and later passed on to a cancer specialist to help them decide whether or not the person has bowel cancer, which kills about 16,600 people a year. Patients excrete the capsule when they go to the toilet. The test is already being used across Scotland. The NHS there has found that most patients tested this way turn out to be cancer-free and do not experience any risks or complications with what they call the ScotCap Test, though the laxatives can leave some feeling sick and dehydrated. Prof Andrew Goddard, president of the Royal College of Physicians, said: “The future of healthcare should be closer to the home, and indeed that is the vision of the NHS Long Term Plan [for the NHS in England]. As technologies develop, we will see more and more tests that can be done at home, which is great, provided they are accessible by all. “Regarding colon capsules, we hope this will save some people from having to have a colonoscopy. But they will still need to have bowel preparation, which many say is the worst part of a colonoscopy, and come to hospitals or clinics to be given the capsule and monitoring equipment.” Prof Peter Johnson, NHS England’s clinical director for cancer, said the latest initiative in at-home care showed the service was fast-tracking new ways of treating and diagnosing cancer. It responded to the suspension of much hospital-based cancer care during the pandemic by delivering chemotherapy drugs to thousands of patients who were unable to have radiotherapy. “This is just one further example of the NHS embracing the latest innovative treatment options and bringing the NHS home to patients.” Prof Martin Marshall, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said: “We’re aware that some patients are reluctant to seek help for certain cancers because the diagnostic tests available can be invasive, so this is a fascinating development and we will be very interested to see the results of the trial. “GPs are preparing for an upsurge in cases of suspected cancer cases post-Covid, and the capsule cameras and new test for cervical cancer are welcome developments that could enable more patients to monitor and manage their own health at home without embarrassment or discomfort.” The endoscopy team at University College London Hospitals NHS trust is already using the capsules to detect bowel cancer.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'Majority think Covid has increased UK social inequality, survey shows',\n",
       "  'full_article': 'Over half of the public believes the coronavirus outbreak has driven greater social inequality in the UK over the past few months, according to a study by the government’s independent advisers. The Social Mobility Commission said its annual survey of public attitudes revealed 56% of adults believed social inequality had increased during the pandemic. A quarter said Covid had made no difference to inequality and 16% were unsure. The commission said the survey echoed growing evidence that the most socially disadvantaged had been hardest hit by the pandemic against a range of measures, from jobs and living standards, to health and access to online schooling. The findings came after years of declining social mobility and a near-decade of rising child poverty, the report said. “Now without urgent, targeted action, social mobility looks set to go backwards and the attainment gap between the wealthy and disadvantaged will grow ever wider.”  Subbed graphic  Steven Cooper, interim co-chair of the commission, said: “This poll dramatically underlines public concern about growing social inequality. Government, employers and educators should listen and act. The most disadvantaged – at home, school or work – should now be put centre stage in any recovery plan.” The online poll, carried out for the Social Mobility Commission by YouGov, surveyed a UK-wide representative sample of 4,693 adults between 27 January and 1 February. At a national level, the survey showed a majority of the people felt their geographical area had been no more badly impacted by coronavirus than anywhere else in the UK. But this overlaid significant regional differences in perceived Covid impact, including evidence of an English north-south divide. Over a third (35%) of respondents in the north of England felt their region had suffered disproportionately harshly in terms of the impact of Covid on jobs. This compared with the south and south-west of England (outside London), where just 17% felt their employment prospects had been hit worse than others.   Related: Covid-19 has exposed the reality of Britain: poverty, insecurity and inequality | Richard Horton   Similarly, 21% of northern Englanders felt their region had been worst affected by the impact of Covid on education, compared with just 8% in the south of England. Exactly a third of people in the north of England felt their living standards had taken the biggest battering, compared with just 10% of those in the south. Just 12% of south of England respondents felt their region had borne the heaviest brunt on health of the pandemic. This compared, at the other end of the scale, with 32% in London, 31% in the north, and 31% in Northern Ireland. Scottish respondents were among those least likely to say they had been worst affected across all indicators. Nearly half (44%) of the sample said they felt better off financially than a decade ago, although this was far more prevalent among the most affluent social classes (50%) than the least well-off (26%). Over a third of the poorest respondents (37%) felt worse off, a significantly higher proportion than any other social class. The proportions of people saying they felt better or worse off financially than they did 10 years previously had remained largely static over the past four years – until this year, when there were significant increases in both groups. The commission said it was not possible to say from the survey whether this dramatic recent change in people’s perceptions of their financial health was related to the coronavirus outbreak, though it said it could be connected to the varying fortunes of those who were able to stay in work and save money, and those who lost their jobs. Asked to rate the two most negative impacts of coronavirus on people in their region, 55% singled out people’s mental health, 44% pinpointed lack of social contact, 26% said job opportunities, 22% chose access to education, and 18% people’s physical health. A government spokesperson said: “This government is committed to levelling up outcomes for every individual, across the country. Supporting people’s mental wellbeing is a priority, which is why we are providing an additional £500m for mental health services and £79m to expand mental health support teams in schools and colleges.  “On top of that, our multi-billion pound plan for jobs aims to protect, support and create jobs across the country and offers targeted support to help jobseekers of all ages back into work.  “We are also providing £1.7bn to help children and young people with education recovery after time out of the classroom.”\\n',\n",
